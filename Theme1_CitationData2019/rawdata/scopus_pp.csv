Several species were described in the late 1800s or early 1900s from the Morrison Formation of North America. Since then, numerous additional specimens were recovered in the USA, Tanzania, Portugal, and Argentina, as well as possibly Spain, England, Georgia, Zimbabwe, and Asia. To date, the clade includes about 12 to 15 nominal species, some of themwith questionable taxonomic status (e.g., 'Diplodocus' hayi or Dyslocosaurus polyonychius), and ranging in age from Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. However, intrageneric relationships of the iconic, multi-species genera Apatosaurus and Diplodocus are still poorly known. The way to resolve this issue is a specimen-based phylogenetic analysis, which has been previously implemented for Apatosaurus, but is here performed for the first time for the entire clade of Diplodocidae. The analysis includes 81 operational taxonomic units, 49 of which belong to Diplodocidae. The set of OTUs includes all name-bearing type specimens previously proposed to belong to Diplodocidae, alongside a set of relatively complete referred specimens, which increase the amount of anatomically overlapping material. Non-diplodocid outgroups were selected to test the affinities of potential diplodocid specimens that have subsequently been suggested to belong outside the clade. The specimens were scored for 477 morphological characters, representing one of the most extensive phylogenetic analyses of sauropod dinosaurs. Character states were figured and tables given in the case of numerical characters. The resulting cladogram recovers the classical arrangement of diplodocid relationships. Two numerical approaches were used to increase reproducibility in our taxonomic delimitation of species and genera. This resulted in the proposal that some species previously included in well-known genera like Apatosaurus and Diplodocus are generically distinct. Of particular note is that the famous genus Brontosaurus is considered valid by our quantitative approach. Furthermore, ""Diplodocus"" hayi represents a unique genus, which will herein be called Galeamopus gen. nov. On the other hand, these numerical approaches imply synonymization of ""Dinheirosaurus"" from the Late Jurassic of Portugal with the Morrison Formation genus Supersaurus. Our use of a specimen-, rather than species-based approach increases knowledge of intraspecific and intrageneric variation in diplodocids, and the study demonstrates how specimen-based phylogenetic analysis is a valuable tool in sauropod taxonomy, and potentially in paleontology and taxonomy as a whole. © 2015 Tschopp et al.","Diplodocidae; New genus; Numerical taxonomy; Sauropod dinosaurs; Specimen-based phylogeny","Amphicoelias; animal structures; Apatosaurus; Article; Atlantosaurus; Australodocus; Barosaurus; Brachiosaurus; Brontosaurus; Camarasaurus; Cetiosauriscus; character state; cladistics; Dinheirosaurus; dinosaur; Diplodocus; Galeamopus; intergroup bias; intraspecific variation; Lower Cretaceous; morphological trait; new genus; nonhuman; paleontology; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; reproducibility; Sauropoda; skull; Supersaurus; taxonomy; Apatosaurus; Dinosauria; Diplodocidae; Diplodocus; Otus; Sauropoda","Tschopp, E.; Geo Bio Tec, Faculdade de Ciência e Tecnologia, Universidade Nova de LisboaPortugal; email: tschopp.e@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926443166

They are: diverse and abundant; a major constituent of many terrestrial ecosystems; and possess a deep and extensive fossil record. In recent years a number of exceptionally preserved arachnid fossils have been investigated using tomography and associated techniques, providing valuable insights into their morphology. Here we use X-ray microtomography to reconstruct members of two extinct arachnid orders. In the Haptopoda, we demonstrate the presence of 'clasp-knife' chelicerae, and our novel redescription of a member of the Phalangiotarbida highlights leg details, but fails to resolve chelicerae in the group due to their small size. As a result of these reconstructions, tomographic studies of three-dimensionally preserved fossils now exist for three of the four extinct orders, and for fossil representatives of several extant ones. Such studies constitute a valuable source of high fidelity data for constructing phylogenies. To illustrate this, here we present a cladistic analysis of the chelicerates to accompany these reconstructions. This is based on a previously published matrix, expanded to include fossil taxa and relevant characters, and allows us to: cladistically place the extinct arachnid orders; explicitly test some earlier hypotheses from the literature; and demonstrate that the addition of fossils to phylogenetic analyses can have broad implications. Phylogenies based on chelicerate morphology-in contrast to molecular studies-have achieved elements of consensus in recent years. Our work suggests that these results are not robust to the addition of novel characters or fossil taxa. Hypotheses surrounding chelicerate phylogeny remain in a state of flux. © 2014 Garwood and Dunlop.","Arachnida; Chelicerata; Fossil; Haptopoda; Palaeozoic; Phalangiotarbida; Phylogeny; Tomography","anatomical variation; arachnid; Article; chelicerate; cladistics; cladogenesis; extinct species; fossil animal; Goniotarbus tuberculatas; image reconstruction; micro-computed tomography; molecular evolution; morphological trait; nonhuman; phylogeny; Plesiosiro madeleyi; stereomicroscopy; three dimensional imaging; Arachnida; Chelicerata; Haptopoda","Garwood, R.J.; School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences and The Manchester X-ray Imaging Facility, School of Materials, The University of ManchesterUnited Kingdom",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84911374228

However, macroevolutionary studies of early archosauromorphs are currently limited by poor knowledge of their phylogenetic relationships. In particular, one of the main early archosauromorph groups that need an exhaustive phylogenetic study is ""Proterosuchia,"" which as historically conceived includes members of both Proterosuchidae and Erythrosuchidae. A new data matrix composed of 96 separate taxa (several of them not included in a quantitative phylogenetic analysis before) and 600 osteological characters was assembled and analysed to generate a comprehensive higher-level phylogenetic hypothesis of basal archosauromorphs and shed light on the species-level interrelationships of taxa historically identified as proterosuchian archosauriforms. The results of the analysis using maximum parsimony include a polyphyletic ""Prolacertiformes"" and ""Protorosauria,"" in which the Permian Aenigmastropheus and Protorosaurus are the most basal archosauromorphs. The enigmatic choristoderans are either found as the sister-taxa of all other lepidosauromorphs or archosauromorphs, but consistently placed within Sauria. Prolacertids, rhynchosaurs, allokotosaurians and tanystropheids are the major successive sister clades of Archosauriformes. The Early Triassic Tasmaniosaurus is recovered as the sister-taxon of Archosauriformes. Proterosuchidae is unambiguosly restricted to five species that occur immediately after and before the Permo-Triassic boundary, thus implying that they are a short-lived ""disaster"" clade. Erythrosuchidae is composed of eight nominal species that occur during the Early and Middle Triassic. ""Proterosuchia"" is polyphyletic, in which erythrosuchids are more closely related to Euparkeria and more crownward archosauriforms than to proterosuchids, and several species are found widespread along the archosauromorph tree, some being nested within Archosauria (e.g., ""Chasmatosaurus ultimus,"" Youngosuchus). Doswelliids and proterochampsids are recovered as more closely related to each other than to other archosauromorphs, forming a large clade (Proterochampsia) of semi-aquatic to aquatic forms that includes the bizarre genus Vancleavea. Euparkeria is one of the sister-taxa of the clade composed of proterochampsians and archosaurs. The putative Indian archosaur Yarasuchus is recovered in a polytomy with Euparkeria and more crownward archosauriforms, and as more closely related to the Russian Dongusuchus than to other species. Phytosaurs are recovered as the sister-taxa of all other pseudosuchians, thus being nested within Archosauria. © 2016 Ezcurra.","Archosauria; Archosauromorpha; Cladistics; Diapsida; Macroevolution; Permian; Phylogeny; Triassic","archosaur; cladistics; disaster; genus; Lower Triassic; Middle Triassic; Permian; sister group; species","Ezcurra, M.D.; School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of BirminghamUnited Kingdom; email: martindezcurra@yahoo.com.ar",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84965160537

New fossil material of the recently recognized family Eomysticetidae from the upper Oligocene Otekaike Limestone includes a new genus and species, Waharoa ruwhenua, represented by skulls and partial skeletons of an adult, juvenile, and a smaller juvenile. Ontogenetic status is confirmed by osteohistology of ribs. Waharoa ruwhenua is characterized by an elongate and narrow rostrum which retains vestigial alveoli and alveolar grooves. Palatal foramina and sulci are present only on the posterior half of the palate. The nasals are elongate, and the bony nares are positioned far anteriorly. Enormous temporal fossae are present adjacent to an elongate and narrow intertemporal region with a sharp sagittal crest. The earbones are characterized by retaining inner and outer posterior pedicles, lacking fused posterior processes, and retaining a separate accessory ossicle. Phylogenetic analysis supports inclusion of Waharoa ruwhenua within a monophyletic Eomysticetidae as the earliest diverging clade of toothless mysticetes. This eomysticetid clade also included Eomysticetus whitmorei, Micromysticetus rothauseni, Tohoraata raekohao, Tokarahia kauaeroa, Tokarahia lophocephalus, and Yamatocetus canaliculatus. Detailed study of ontogenetic change demonstrates postnatal elaboration of the sagittal and nuchal crests, elongation of the intertemporal region, inflation of the zygomatic processes, and an extreme proportional increase in rostral length. Tympanic bullae are nearly full sized during early postnatal ontogeny indicating precocial development of auditory structures, but do increase slightly in size. Positive allometry of the rostrum suggests an ontogenetic change in feeding ecology, from neonatal suckling to a more specialized adult feeding behaviour. Possible absence of baleen anteriorly, a delicate temporomandibular joint with probable synovial capsule, non-laterally deflected coronoid process, and anteroposteriorly expanded palate suggests skim feeding as likely mode of adult feeding for zooplankton. Isotopic data in concert with preservation of young juveniles suggests the continental shelf of Zealandia was an important calving ground for latitudinally migratingOligocene baleen whales. © 2015 Boessenecker and Fordyce.","Eomysticetidae; Filter feeding; Mysticeti; New Zealand; Oligocene; Ontogeny","allometry; anatomical concepts; Article; auditory ossicle; cladistics; continental shelf; feeding behavior; feeding ecology; fossil; histology; humerus; juvenile animal; lumbar vertebra; malleus; maxilla; new genus; New Zealand; nonhuman; Oligocene; ontogeny; paleontology; phylogeny; rib; scapula; skull; temporomandibular joint; ulna; Waharoa ruwhenua; whale","Boessenecker, R.W.; Department of Geology, University of OtagoNew Zealand",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944873191

Several anatomical features enabled this extreme elongation, including: absolutely large body size and quadrupedal stance providing a stable platform for a long neck; a small, light head that did not orally process food; cervical vertebrae that were both numerous and individually elongate; an efficient air-sac-based respiratory system; and distinctive cervical architecture. Relevant features of sauropod cervical vertebrae include: pneumatic chambers that enabled the bone to be positioned in a mechanically efficient way within the envelope; and muscular attachments of varying importance to the neural spines, epipophyses and cervical ribs. Other long-necked tetrapods lacked important features of sauropods, preventing the evolution of longer necks: for example, giraffes have relatively small torsos and large, heavy heads, share the usual mammalian constraint of only seven cervical vertebrae, and lack an air-sac system and pneumatic bones. Among non-sauropods, their saurischian relatives the theropod dinosaurs seemto have been best placed to evolve long necks, and indeed their necks probably surpassed those of giraffes.

To date, these approaches have not been comprehensively applied to the dominant genera in mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) because several species in these genera occur primarily at depths that are poorly explored and from which sample collections are limited. This study is the first integrated morphological and molecular systematic analysis of the genera Leptoseris and Pavona to examine material both fromshallow-water reefs (<30 m) and frommid- to lower- MCEs (>60 m). Skeletal and tissue samples were collected throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago between 2-127 m. A novel mitochondrial marker (cox1-1-rRNA intron) was sequenced for 70 colonies, and the micromorphologies of 94 skeletons, plus selected type material, were analyzed. The cox1-1-rRNA intron resolved 8 clades, yet Leptoseris and Pavona were polyphyletic. Skeletal micromorphology, especially costal ornamentation, showed strong correspondence and discrete differences between mitochondrial groups. One putative new Leptoseris species was identified and the global depth range of the genus Pavona was extended to 89 m, suggesting that the diversity of mesophotic scleractinians has been underestimated. Examination of species' depth distributions revealed a pattern of depth zonation: Species common in shallow-water were absent or rare >40 m, whereas others occurred only >60 m. These patterns emphasize the importance of integrated systematic analyses and more comprehensive sampling by depth in assessing the connectivity and diversity of MCEs. © 2013 Luck et al.","Cox1-1-rRNA intron; Depth zonation; Integrated systematics; Leptoseris; Mesophotic coral ecosystems; Micromorphology; Molecular phylogenetics; Pavona; Taxonomy; Zooxanthellate corals","animal tissue; article; Bayes theorem; coral; gene sequence; Leptoseris; morphology; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Pavona; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; polyphyly; scanning electron microscopy; sequence alignment; species identification; taxonomy","Luck, D.G.; Hawai'i Pacific University, Marine Science Program, Waimanalo, HI, United States; email: dluck@my.hpu.edu",,,21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885134050

Here, we describe the bone microstructure and quantify the histovariability of appendicular elements and osteoderms from three juvenile American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) to assess growth mark and tissue organization within and amongst individuals, with the intention of validating paleohistological interpretations. Results confirm previous observations that lamellar and parallel fibered tissue organization are typical of crocodylians, and also that crocodylians are capable of forming woven tissue for brief periods. Tissue organization and growth mark count varies across individual skeletal elements and reveal that the femur, tibia, and humerus had the highest annual apposition rates in each individual. Cyclical growth mark count also varies intraskeletally, but data suggest these inconsistencies are due to differing medullary cavity expansion rates. There was no appreciable difference in either diaphyseal circumference or cyclical growth mark circumferences between left and right element pairs from an individual if diaphyses were sampled from roughly the same location. The considerable intraskeletal data obtained here provide validation for long-held paleohistology assumptions, but because medullary expansion, cyclical growth mark formation, and variable intraskeletal growth rates are skeletal features found in tetrapod taxa living or extinct, the validations presented herein should be considered during any tetrapod bone microanalysis. © 2014 Woodward et al.","Alligator; Growth rates; Histology; Intraskeletal; Ontogeny; Paleontology; Variation","Alligator mississippiensis; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; bone matrix; bone mineralization; cortical bone; cortical thickness (bone); diaphysis; female; femur; fibula; genetic variability; histology; humerus; male; microanalysis; nonhuman; osteocyte; osteohistology; quantitative analysis; tibia; tissue growth; ulna","Woodward, H.N.; Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences, Tulsa, OK, United States; email: holly.n.woodward@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903844962

Morphological stasis, however, can potentially lead to diversification rates being underestimated. Notostraca, or tadpole shrimps, is an ancient, globally distributed order of branchiopod crustaceans regarded as 'living fossils' because their rich fossil record dates back to the early Devonian and their morphology is highly conserved. Recent phylogenetic reconstructions have shown a strong biogeographic signal, suggesting diversification due to continental breakup, and widespread cryptic speciation. However, morphological conservatism makes it difficult to place fossil taxa in a phylogenetic context. Here we reveal for the first time the timing and tempo of tadpole shrimp diversification by inferring a robust multilocus phylogeny of Bran- chiopoda and applying Bayesian divergence dating techniques using reliable fossil calibrations external to Notostraca. Our results suggest at least two bouts of global radiation in Notostraca, one of them recent, so questioning the validity of the 'living fossils' concept in groups where cryptic speciation is widespread. © 2013 Mathers et al.","'Living fossil'; Bayesian analysis; Biogeography; Divergence time; Diversification; Fossil; Lepidurus; Notostraca; Triops","cytochrome c oxidase; article; evolution; fossil animal; multilocus sequence typing; nonhuman; phylogeny; radiation; shrimp; species differentiation","Gómez, A.; School of Biological, Biomedical and Environmental Sciences, University of Hull, Hull, United Kingdom; email: a.gomez@hull.ac.uk",,,21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877130233

However, its rapid evolution in recent years from a novel approach to common practice demands some scrutiny in regards to the validity of results and the appropriateness of assumptions inherent in setting up simulations. Both validation and sensitivity analyses remain unexplored in many comparative analyses, and assumptions considered to be 'reasonable' are often assumed to have little influence on the results and their interpretation. Here we report an extensive sensitivity analysis where high resolution finite element (FE) models of mandibles from seven species of crocodile were analysed under loads typical for comparative analysis: biting, shaking, and twisting. Simulations explored the effect on both the absolute response and the interspecies pattern of results to variations in commonly used input parameters. Our sensitivity analysis focuses on assumptions relating to the selection of material properties (heterogeneous or homogeneous), scaling (standardising volume, surface area, or length), tooth position (front, mid, or back tooth engagement), and linear load case (type of loading for each feeding type). Our findings show that in a comparative context, FE models are far less sensitive to the selection of material property values and scaling to either volume or surface area than they are to those assumptions relating to the functional aspects of the simulation, such as tooth position and linear load case. Results show a complex interaction between simulation assumptions, depending on the combination of assumptions and the overall shape of each specimen. Keeping assumptions consistent between models in an analysis does not ensure that results can be generalised beyond the specific set of assumptions used. Logically, different comparative datasets would also be sensitive to identical simulation assumptions; hence, modelling assumptions should undergo rigorous selection. The accuracy of input data is paramount, and simulations should focus on taking biological context into account. Ideally, validation of simulations should be addressed; however, where validation is impossible or unfeasible, sensitivity analyses should be performed to identify which assumptions have the greatest influence upon the results. © 2013 Walmsleyet al.","Biomechanics; Comparative analysis; Comparative biomechanics; Computational biomechanics; Crocodiles; FEA; Finite element analysis; Material properties; Scaling; Sensitivity analysis","anatomical concepts; article; biomechanics; bite; comparative study; computer simulation; crocodile; feeding behavior; finite element analysis; linear load case; nonhuman; scaling; sensitivity analysis; taxonomic rank","Walmsley, C.W.; Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, School of Biomedical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; email: c.w.walmsley@gmail.com",,,21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888380261

Only two of these have been described in any detail: the holotype specimenMinmi paravertebra fromthe Bungil Formation near Roma, and a near complete skeleton fromthe Allaru Mudstone onMarathon Station near Richmond, preliminarily referred to a possible new species of Minmi. The Marathon specimen represents one of the world's most complete ankylosaurian skeletons and the best-preserved dinosaurian fossil from eastern Gondwana. Moreover, among ankylosaurians, its skull is one of only a few in which the majority of sutures have not been obliterated by dermal ossifications or surface remodelling. Recent preparation of theMarathon specimen has revealed new details of the palate and narial regions, permitting a comprehensive description and thus providing new insights cranial osteology of a basal ankylosaurian. The skull has also undergone computed tomography, digital segmentation and 3D computer visualisation enabling the reconstruction of its nasal cavity and endocranium. The airways of the Marathon specimen are more complicated than non-ankylosaurian dinosaurs but less so than derived ankylosaurians. The cranial (brain) endocast is superficially similar to those of other ankylosaurians but is strongly divergent in many important respects. The inner ear is extremely large and unlike that of any dinosaur yet known.

Eucryptodiran turtles from the Late Jurassic (mainly Kimmeridgian) deposits of the Jura Mountains (Switzerland and France) are among the earliest named species traditionally referred to the Plesiochelyidae, Thalassemydidae, and Eurysternidae. As such, they are a reference for the study of Late Jurassic eucryptodires at the European scale. Fifteen species and four genera have been typified based on material from the Late Jurassic of the JuraMountains. In the past 50 years, diverging taxonomic reassessments have been proposed for these turtles with little agreement in sight. In addition, there has been a shift of focus from shell to cranial anatomy in the past forty years, although most of these species are only represented by shell material. As a result, the taxonomic status of many of these 15 species remains ambiguous, which prevents comprehensive comparison of Late Jurassic turtle assemblages throughout Europe and hinders description of new discoveries, such as the new assemblage recently unearthed in the vicinity of Porrentruy, Switzerland. Methods. An exhaustive reassessment of the available material provides new insights into the comparative anatomy of these turtles. The taxonomic status of each of the 15 species typified based on material from the Late Jurassic of the JuraMountains is evaluated. New diagnoses and general descriptions are provided for each valid taxon. Results. Six out of the 15 available species names are recognized as valid: Plesiochelys etalloni, Craspedochelys picteti, Craspedochelys jaccardi, Tropidemys langii, Thalassemys hugii, and 'Thalassemys' moseri. The intraspecific variability of the shell of P. etalloni is discussed based on a sample of about 30 relatively complete specimens fromSolothurn, Switzerland. New characters are proposed to differentiate P. etalloni, C. picteti, and C. jaccardi, therefore rejecting the previously proposed synonymy of these forms. Based partly on previously undescribed specimens, the plastral morphology of Th. hugii is redescribed. The presence of lateral plastral fontanelles is notably revealed in this species, which calls into question the traditional definitions of the Thalassemydidae and Eurysternidae. Based on these new data, Eurysternum ignoratum is considered a junior synonymof Th. hugii. The Eurysternidae are therefore only represented by Solnhofia parsonsi in the Late Jurassic of the JuraMountains. Finally, 'Th.' moseri is recognized as a valid species, although a referral to the genus Thalassemys is refuted. © 2014 Anquetin et al.","Craspedochelys; Kimmeridgian; Plesiochelyidae; Plesiochelys; Testudines; Thalassemydidae; Thalassemys; Tithonian; Tropidemys","animal shell; article; Craspedochelys; Eurysternum ignoratum; geographical variation (species); morphology; neck muscle; nonhuman; paleontology; Plesiochelys; taxonomy; Thalassemys moseri; Tropidemys; turtle","Anquetin, J.; Section d'archéologie et paléontologie, Office de la culture, République et Canton du Jura, Porrentruy, Switzerland; email: j.anquetin@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903823201

We present a phylogenetic survey of limb bone histology and growth patterns in therocephalians fromtheMiddle Permian throughMiddle Triassic of the Karoo Basin, South Africa. Histologic sections were prepared from 80 limb bones representing 11 genera of therocephalians. Histologic indicators of skeletal growth, including cortical vascularity (%CV) and mean primary osteon diameters (POD), were evaluated in a phylogenetic framework and assessed for correlations with other biologically significant variables (e.g., size and robusticity). Changes in %CV and POD correlated strongly with evolutionary changes in body size (i.e., smaller-bodied descendants tended to have lower %CV than their larger-bodied ancestors across the tree). Bone wall thickness tended to be high in early therocephalians and lower in the gracile-limbed baurioids, but showed no general correlation with cross-sectional area or degree of vascularity (and, thus, growth). Clade-level patterns, however, deviated from previously studied within-lineage patterns. For example, Moschorhinus, one of few therapsid genera to have survived the extinction boundary, demonstrated higher %CV in the Triassic than in the Permian despite its smaller size in the extinction aftermath. Results support a synergistic model of size reductions for Triassic therocephalians, influenced both by within-lineage heterochronic shifts in survivor taxa (as reported inMoschorhinus and the dicynodont Lystrosaurus) and phylogenetically inferred survival of small-bodied taxa that had evolved short growth durations (e.g., baurioids). These findings mirror themulti-causal Lilliput patterns described in marine faunas, but contrast with skeletochronologic studies that suggest slow, prolonged shell secretion over several years in marine benthos. Applications of phylogenetic comparative methods to new histologic data will continue to improve our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of growth and body size shifts during mass extinctions and recoveries. © 2014 Huttenlocker and Botha-Brink.","Cortical vascularity; End-Permian extinction; Lilliput effect; Paleohistology; Synapsids; Triassic","amniote; animal tissue; article; body size; bone growth; bone structure; bone tissue; correlation analysis; dynamics; evolution; histology; humerus; mass extinction; nonhuman; phylogeny; South Africa; vascularization","Huttenlocker, A.K.; Department of Biology and Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States; email: ahuttenlocker@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899056270

A high metabolic rate is sustainable thanks to efficient food processing and that in turn is facilitated by precise occlusion of the teeth and the acquisition of rhythmic mastication. These major evolutionary innovations characterize most members of the ClassMammalia. Cetaceans are one of the few groups of mammals in which precise occlusion has been secondarily lost.Most toothed whales have an increased number of simple crowned teeth that are similar along the tooth row. Evolution toward these specializations began immediately after the time cetaceans transitioned from terrestrial-to-marine environments. The fossil record documents the critical aspects of occlusal evolution of cetaceans, and allows us to pinpoint the evolutionary timing of the macroevolutionary events leading to their unusual dental morphology among mammals. The developmental controls of tooth differentiation and tooth number have been studied in a few mammalian clades, but nothing is known about how these controls differ between cetaceans and mammals that retain functional occlusion. Here we show that pigs, a cetacean relative with regionalized tooth morphology and complex tooth crowns, retain the typical mammalian gene expression patterns that control early tooth differentiation, expressing Bmp4 in the rostral (mesial, anterior) domain of the jaw, and Fgf8 caudally (distal, posterior). By contrast, dolphins have lost these regional differences in dental morphology and the Bmp4 domain is extended into the caudal region of the developing jaw. We hypothesize that the functional constraints underlying mammalian occlusion have been released in cetaceans, facilitating changes in the genetic control of early dental development. Such major developmental changes drive morphological evolution and are correlated with major shifts in diet and food processing during cetacean evolution. © 2013 Armfield et al.","Cetacea; Cetacean; Evo-devo; Paleontology; Teeth","bone morphogenetic protein 4; fibroblast growth factor 8; animal tissue; article; cetacean; controlled study; dentition; dolphin; embryo; embryology; evolution; gene expression; histology; immunohistochemistry; in situ hybridization; marine mammal; metabolic rate; morphology; mouse; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; premolar tooth; protein expression; protein localization; swine; tooth crown; tooth development; whale","Armfield, B.A.; Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, OH, United States; email: Barmfield@ufl.edu",,,21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877124124

Combined with experimental data, we use this model to test two main hypotheses. We first query whether ostriches use limb orientations (joint angles) that optimize the moment-generating capacities of their muscles during walking or running. Next, we test whether ostriches use limb orientations at mid-stance that keep their extensor muscles near maximal, and flexor muscles near minimal, moment arms. Our two hypotheses relate to the control priorities that a large bipedal animal might evolve under biomechanical constraints to achieve more effective static weight support. We find that ostriches do not use limb orientations to optimize the moment-generating capacities or moment arms of their muscles.We infer that dynamic properties ofmuscles or tendons might be better candidates for locomotor optimization. Regardless, general principles explaining why species choose particular joint orientations during locomotion are lacking, raising the question of whether such general principles exist or if clades evolve different patterns (e.g., weighting of muscle force-length or force-velocity properties in selecting postures). This leaves theoretical studies of muscle moment arms estimated for extinct animals at an impasse until studies of extant taxa answer these questions. Finally, we compare our model's results against those of two prior studies of ostrich limb muscle moment arms, finding general agreement for many muscles. Some flexor and extensor muscles exhibit self-stabilization patterns (posture-dependent switches between flexor/extensor action) that ostriches may use to coordinate their locomotion. However, some conspicuous areas of disagreement in our results illustrate some cautionary principles. Importantly, tendon-travel empirical measurements ofmuscle moment arms must be carefully designed to preserve 3D muscle geometry lest their accuracy suffer relative to that of anatomically realistic models. The dearth of accurate experimental measurements of 3D moment arms ofmuscles in birds leaves uncertainty regarding the relative accuracy of different modelling or experimental datasets such as in ostriches. Our model, however, provides a comprehensive set of 3D estimates ofmuscle actions in ostriches for the first time, emphasizing that avian limb mechanics are highly three-dimensional and complex, and how nomuscles act purely in the sagittal plane. A comparative synthesis of experiments and models such as ours could provide powerful synthesis into how anatomy, mechanics and control interact during locomotion and how these interactions evolve. Such a framework could remove obstacles impeding the analysis ofmuscle function in extinct taxa. © 2015 Hutchinson et al.","Biomechanics; Bird; Gait; Moment arm; Muscle; Paleognathae; Posture; Ratite","adult; anatomic landmark; animal tissue; Article; biomechanics; computer model; female; kinematics; locomotion; mathematical model; muscle function; musculoskeletal function; nonhuman; ostrich; pelvic girdle; tendon","Hutchinson, J.R.; Structure and Motion Laboratory, Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, The Royal Veterinary College, University of LondonUnited Kingdom",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945190908

Recently a similar pattern of airflow has been observed in American alligators, a sister taxon to birds. The pattern of flow appears to be due to the arrangement of the primary and secondary bronchi, which, via their branching angles, generate inspiratory and expiratory aerodynamic valves. Both the anatomical similarity of the avian and alligator lung and the similarity in the patterns of airflow raise the possibility that these features are plesiomorphic for Archosauria and therefore did not evolve in response to selection for flapping flight or an endothermic metabolism, as has been generally assumed. To further test the hypothesis that unidirectional airflow is ancestral for Archosauria, we measured airflow in the lungs of the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus). As in birds and alligators, air flows cranially to caudally in the cervical ventral bronchus, and caudally to cranially in the dorsobronchi in the lungs of Nile crocodiles.We also visualized the gross anatomy of the primary, secondary and tertiary pulmonary bronchi of C. niloticus using computed tomography (CT) and microCT. The cervical ventral bronchus, cranial dorsobronchi and cranial medial bronchi display similar characteristics to their proposed homologues in the alligator, while there is considerable variation in the tertiary and caudal group bronchi. Our data indicate that the aspects of the crocodilian bronchial tree that maintain the aerodynamic valves and thus generate unidirectional airflow, are ancestral for Archosauria. © 2013 Schachner et al.","Anatomy; Bronchi; Crocodylia; Endothermy; Evolution; Lung; Pneumaticity; Respiration","anastomosing bronchi; anatomy; animal tissue; archosaur; article; bird; breathing; bronchus; caudal group bronchi; cervical ventral bronchi; computer assisted tomography; crocodile; lung; lung inflation; micro-computed tomography; nonhuman; respiratory airflow; trachea","Schachner, E.R.; Department of Biology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States; email: eschachner@gmail.com",,,21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877320907

The skull and skeleton of a juvenile Parasaurolophus from the late Campanian-aged (~75.5 Ma) Kaiparowits Formation of southern Utah, USA, represents the smallest and most complete specimen yet described for this taxon. The individual was approximately 2.5 m in body length (~25% maximum adult body length) at death, with a skull measuring 246 mm long and a femur 329 mm long. A histological section of the tibia shows well-vascularized, woven and parallel-fibered primary cortical bone typical of juvenile ornithopods. The histological section revealed no lines of arrested growth or annuli, suggesting the animal may have still been in its first year at the time of death. Impressions of the upper rhamphotheca are preserved in association with the skull, showing that the soft tissue component for the beak extended for some distance beyond the limits of the oral margin of the premaxilla. In marked contrast with the lengthy tube-like crest in adult Parasaurolophus, the crest of the juvenile specimen is low and hemicircular in profile, with an open premaxilla-nasal fontanelle. Unlike juvenile lambeosaurins, the nasal passages occupy nearly the entirety of the crest in juvenile Parasaurolophus. Furthermore, Parasaurolophus initiated development of the crest at less than 25% maximum skull size, contrasting with 50% of maximum skull size in hadrosaurs such as Corythosaurus. This early development may correspond with the larger and more derived form of the crest in Parasaurolophus, as well as the close relationship between the crest and the respiratory system. In general, ornithischian dinosaurs formed bony cranial ornamentation at a relatively younger age and smaller size than seen in extant birds. This may reflect, at least in part, that ornithischians probably reached sexual maturity prior to somatic maturity, whereas birds become reproductively mature after reaching adult size. © 2013 Farke et al.","Cretaceous; Dinosauria; Hadrosauridae; Heterochrony; Kaiparowits Formation; Lambeosaurinae; Ontogeny; Ornithischia; Parasaurolophus","article; computer assisted tomography; Cretaceous; dinosaur; evolution; field work; hadrosauridae; heterochrony; histology; laser microscopy; mandible; measurement; nonhuman; ontogeny; paleontology; parasaurolophus; photography; skeleton; skull base","Farke, A.A.; Raymond M.

Unique features of the cervical vertebrae, which are only present on elasmosaurids from the Western Interior Seaway, are recognized based on these specimens and by comparison with penecontemporaneous taxa with biogeographic affinities. Phylogenetic analysis, bivariate graphic analysis of cervical vertebrae proportions, comparisons of different cervical vertebral types, paleobiogeographic distribution and study of the elasmosaurid axial evolution throughout the Cretaceous are here integrated. As a result, at least two separate lineages within the Elasmosauridae are identified by independently acquired extremely-long necks (over 60 cervical vertebrae). First, a still scarcely known lineage is so far represented by the lower Cenomanian Thalassomedon haningtoni, the Turonian Libonectes morgani and close relatives. A second lineage is here defined as a new clade, the Styxosaurinae, which groups the Campanian genera Terminonatator, Styxosaurus (='Hydralmosaurus'), Albertonectes and Elasmosaurus, the two latter forming a derived branch that includes the most extreme amniote necks known to date (more than 70 cervical vertebrae). Phylogenetic analysis supports AMNH1495 and AMNH5835 as being closely related to Styxosaurus snowii. Therefore, the species Styxosaurus browni is re-validated, while AMNH 1495 is here referred to Styxosaurus sp. This research also recognizes the 'Cimoliasauridae' (nomen dubium) as a paraphyletic group but informative of a plesiomorphic cervical vertebral morphology of elasmosaurids which was persistent throughout the whole Cretaceous and from whom aristonectines, styxosaurines and Thalassomedon and close relatives are derived.

Previous studies of this remarkable taxon have included its phylogenetic interpretation as an aberrant dromaeosaurid with velociraptorine affinities. However, Balaur displays a combination of both apparently plesiomorphic and derived bird-like characters. Here, we analyse those features in a phylogenetic revision and show how they challenge its referral to Dromaeosauridae. Our reanalysis of two distinct phylogenetic datasets focusing on basal paravian taxa supports the reinterpretation of Balaur as an avialan more crownward than Archaeopteryx but outside of Pygostylia, and as a flightless taxon within a paraphyletic assemblage of long-tailed birds. Our placement of Balaur within Avialae is not biased by character weighting. The placement among dromaeosaurids resulted in a suboptimal alternative that cannot be rejected based on the data to hand. Interpreted as a dromaeosaurid, Balaur has been assumed to be hypercarnivorous and predatory, exhibiting a peculiar morphology influenced by island endemism. However, a dromaeosaurid-like ecology is contradicted by several details of Balaur's morphology, including the loss of a third functional manual digit, the non-ginglymoid distal end of metatarsal II, and a non-falciform ungual on the second pedal digit that lacks a prominent flexor tubercle. Conversely, an omnivorous ecology is better supported by Balaur's morphology and is consistent with its phylogenetic placement within Avialae. Our reinterpretation of Balaur implies that a superficially dromaeosaurid-like taxon represents the enlarged, terrestrialised descendant of smaller and probably volant ancestors. © 2015 Cau et al.","Avialae; Deinonychosauria; Homoplasy; Mesozoic; Paraves","acetabulum; Archaeopteryx; Article; Balaur bondoc; carpal bone; dinosaur; evolution; fibula; flexor muscle; hallux; homoplasy; humerus; ischial tuberosity; ischium; Mesozoic; metacarpal bone; metatarsal bone; nonhuman; pelvic girdle; phylogeny; pubic bone; sacrum; species endemicity; tibia; ulna","Cau, A.; Earth, Life and Environmental Sciences Department, Alma Mater Studiorum, Bologna UniversityItaly",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945174434

Biomineralization of silica is widespread among terrestrial eukaryotes such as plants, soil diatoms, freshwater sponges, silicifying flagellates and testate amoebae. Two major groups of testate (shelled) amoebae, arcellinids and euglyphids, produce their own silica particles to construct shells. The two are unrelated phylogenetically and acquired biomineralizing capabilities independently. Hyalosphenids, a group within arcellinids, are predators of euglyphids.We demonstrate that hyalosphenids can construct shells using silica scales mineralized by the euglyphids. Parsimony analyses of the current hyalosphenid phylogeny indicate that the ability to ""steal"" euglyphid scales is most likely ancestral in hyalosphenids, implying that euglyphids should be older than hyalosphenids. However, exactly when euglyphids arose is uncertain. Current fossil record contains unambiguous euglyphid fossils that are as old as 50 million years, but older fossils are scarce and difficult to interpret. Poor taxon sampling of euglyphids has also prevented the development of molecular clocks. Here, we present a novel molecular clock reconstruction for arcellinids and consider the uncertainties due to various previously used calibration points. The new molecular clock puts the origin of hyalosphenids in the early Carboniferous (~370 mya). Notably, this estimate coincides with the widespread colonization of land by Si-accumulating plants, suggesting possible links between the evolution of Arcellinid testate amoebae and the expansion of terrestrial habitats rich in organic matter and bioavailable Si. © 2015 Lahr et al.","Amoebozoa; Ancestral state reconstruction; Conquer of terrestrial environment; Coupled carbon and silica cycles; Evolution of eukaryotes; Molecular clocks; Silica cycle; Testate amoebae; Vase shaped microfossils","amoeba (life cycle stage); ancestral state reconstruction; Article; biomineralization; ecosystem; eukaryote; eukaryote evolution; fossil; geographic mapping; molecular clock; nonhuman; Phanerozoic; phylogeny; Sphagnum","Lahr, D.J.G.; Department of Zoology, Institute of Biosciences, University of São Paulo, Rua do Matão, Brazil",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944870720

Retrodeformation offers a means by which to recover a hypothesis of the original anatomy of the specimen, and 3D scanning technologies present a way to constrain and document the retrodeformation process. Using computed tomography (CT) scan data, specimen specific retrodeformations were performed on three-dimensionally preserved but taphonomically distorted skulls of the deinocheirid Garudimimus brevipes Barsbold, 1981 and the ornithomimids Struthiomimus altus Lambe, 1902 and Ornithomimus edmontonicus Sternberg, 1933.

Thus, even as the known diversity of these taxa has dramatically increased over the past two decades, our knowledge of their placement relative to each other and the major ornithischian subclades remained incomplete. This study employs the largest phylogenetic dataset yet compiled to assess basal ornithischian relationships (255 characters for 65 species level terminal taxa). The resulting strict consensus tree is the most well-resolved, stratigraphically consistent hypothesis of basal ornithischian relationships yet hypothesized. The only non-iguanodontian ornithopod (Dbasal ornithopod) recovered in this analysis is Hypsilophodon foxii. The majority of former 'hypsilophodontid' taxa are recovered within a single clade (Parksosauridae) that is situated as the sister-taxon to Cerapoda. The Parksosauridae is divided between two subclades, the Orodrominae and the Thescelosaurinae. This study does not recover a clade consisting of the Asian taxa Changchunsaurus, Haya, and Jeholosaurus (DJeholosauridae). Rather, the former two taxa are recovered as basal members of Thescelosaurinae, while the latter taxon is recovered in a clade with Yueosaurus near the base of Neornithischia.The endemic South American clade Elasmaria is recovered within the Thescelosaurinae as the sister taxon to Thescelosaurus. This study supports the origination of Dinosauria and the early diversification of Ornithischia within Gondwana. Neornithischia first arose in Africa by the Early Jurassic before dispersing to Asia before the late Middle Jurassic, where much of the diversification among non-cerapodan neornithischians occurred. Under the simplest scenario the Parksosauridae originated in North America, with at least two later dispersals to Asia and one to South America. However, when ghost lineages are considered, an alternate dispersal hypothesis has thescelosaurines dispersing from Asia into South America (via North America) during the Early Cretaceous, then back into North America in the latest Cretaceous. The latter hypothesis may explain the dominance of orodromine taxa prior to the Maastrichtian in North America and the sudden appearance and wide distribution of thescelosaurines in North America beginning in the early Maastrichtian. While the diversity of parksosaurids has greatly increased over the last fifteen years, a ghost lineage of over 40 myr is present between the base of Parksosauridae and Cerapoda, indicating that much of the early history and diversity of this clade is yet to be discovered. This new phylogenetic hypothesis provides a comprehensive framework for testing further hypotheses regarding evolutionary patterns and processes within Ornithischia. © 2015 Boyd.","Biogeography; Dinosauria; Neornithischia; Ornithischia; Ornithopoda; Phylogeny; Stratigraphic consistency; Systematics","Africa; Asia; cladistics; consensus; dinosaur; Lower Cretaceous; Lower Jurassic; Maastrichtian; Middle Jurassic; North America; sister group; South America; species","Boyd, C.A.; North Dakota Geological SurveyUnited States; email: clintboyd@stratfit.org",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955591903

The putative susisuchid Isisfordia duncani was initially described as a transitional formexhibiting incipient versions of these eusuchian traits. Here we examine aspects of the morphology of Isisfordia and comment on the morphology of its putative sister taxon Susisuchus. Our reexamination supports the notion of Isisfordia possessing transitional vertebral morphology but we present a new interpretation of its palate construction that shows it to be more plesiomorphic than previously thought. The secondary choana of Isisfordia is not pterygoid bound. Instead, long palatines expand distally lapping under the pterygoid to form the anterior border of the choana as is common among many advanced neosuchians. Incorporation of these observations into an expanded phylogenetic dataset of neosuchian crocodyliforms results in a new phylogenetic hypothesis for Susisuchidae.

Neither combined morphological and molecular studies nor recent attempts to resolve family relationships using sequence data from whole plastomes has resulted in a well-supported, family-level phylogenetic hypothesis of relationships. Here we approach this challenge by leveraging the complete genome of one member of the order, Musa acuminata, together with transcriptome information from each of the other seven families to design a set of nuclear loci that can be enriched from highly divergent taxa with a single array-based capture of indexed genomic DNA. A total of 494 exons from 418 nuclear genes were captured for 53 ingroup taxa. The entire plastid genome was also captured for the same 53 taxa. Of the total genes captured, 308 nuclear and 68 plastid genes were used for phylogenetic estimation. The concatenated plastid and nuclear dataset supports the position of Musaceae as sister to the remaining seven families. Moreover, the combined dataset recovers known intra- and inter-family phylogenetic relationships with generally high bootstrap support.

Ever since its original description, both its taxonomic validity and systematic affinities were contentious. Originally considered to represent its own family, Sigilmassasauridae, the genus has variously been suggested to represent a carcharodontosaurid, an ornithischian, and, more recently, a spinosaurid. Here we describe new remains referrable to this taxon and re-evaluate its taxonomic status and systematic affinities. Based on the new remains, a re-evaluation of the original materials, and comparisons with other spinosaurids, the holotype of Sigilmassasaurus brevicollis is identified as an anterior dorsal, rather than a cervical vertebra, and differences between elements referred to this taxon can be explained by different positions of the elements in question within the vertebral column. Many characters used previously to diagnose the genus and species are found to be more widespread among basal tetanurans, and specifically spinosaurids. However, the taxon shows several autapomorphies that support its validity, including the presence of a strongly rugose, ventrally offset triangular platformthat is confluent with a ventral keel anteriorly in the mid-cervical vertebral centra and a strongly reduced lateral neural arch lamination, with no or an incomplete distinction between anterior and posterior centrodiapophyseal laminae in the posterior cervical and anterior dorsal vertebrae. We argue furthermore that Spinosaurus maroccanus, also described on the basis of isolated cervical vertebrae from the same stratigraphic unit and in the same paper as Sigilmassasaurus brevicollis, is a subjective synonym of the latter. Both a detailed comparison of this taxon with other theropods and a formal phylogenetic analysis support spinosaurid affintities for Sigilmassasaurus. However, we reject the recently proposed synonymy of both Spinosaurus maroccanus and Sigilmassasurus brevicollis with Spinosaurus aegyptiacus from the Cenomanian of Egypt, as there are clear differences between the vertebrae of these taxa, and they do not share any derived character that is not found in other spinosaurids. Together with a comparison with other spinosaurid vertebral material fromthe KemKem, this suggests that more than one taxon of spinosaurid was present in the Kem Kem assemblage of Morocco, so the referral of non-overlapping material from this unit to a single taxon should be regarded with caution. © 2015 Evers et al.","Africa; Kem Kem; Spinosauridae; Vertebral morphology","anterior dorsal vertebrae; Article; Carcharodontosaurus saharicus; cervical spine; computer assisted tomography; dinosaur; dorsal vertebrae; histology; Morocco; morphology; nonhuman; paleontology; phylogeny; Sigilmassasaurus; Sigilmassasaurus brevicollis; species diversity; Spinosaurus aegyptiacus; taxonomy; vertebra","Evers, S.W.; Department of Earth Sciences, University of OxfordUnited Kingdom; email: serjoscha.evers@univ.ox.ac.uk",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946237093

In this case study we analyze variability of footprint shape within one large theropod (T3), one mediumsized theropod (T2) and one ornithopod (I1) trackway from the Lower Cretaceous of Münchehagen (Lower Saxony, Germany) in order to determine the informativeness of individual features and measurements for ichnotaxonomy, trackmaker identification, and the discrimination between left and right footprints. Landmark analysis is employed based on interpretative outline drawings derived from photogrammetric data, allowing for the location of variability within the footprint and the assessment of covariation of separate footprint parts. Objective methods to define the margins of a footprint are tested and shown to be sufficiently accurate to reproduce the most important results. The lateral hypex and the heel are the most variable regions in the two theropod trackways. As indicated by principal component analysis, a posterior shift of the lateral hypex is correlated with an anterior shift of the margin of the heel. This pattern is less pronounced in the ornithopod trackway, indicating that variation patterns can differ in separate trackways. In all trackways, hypices vary independently from each other, suggesting that their relative position a questionable feature for ichnotaxonomic purposes. Most criteria commonly employed to differentiate between left and right footprints assigned to theropods are found to be reasonably reliable. The described ornithopod footprints are asymmetrical, again allowing for a left-right differentiation. Strikingly, 12 out of 19 measured footprints of the T2 trackway are stepped over the trackway midline, rendering the trackway pattern a misleading left-right criterion for this trackway. Traditional measurements were unable to differentiate between the theropod and the ornithopod trackways.

More recent discoveries of adapiform fossils in other parts of the world have revealed Caenopithecus to be a biogeographic enigma, as it is potentially more closely related to Eocene adapiforms from Africa, Asia, and North America than it is to any known European forms. More anatomical evidence is needed, however, to provide robust tests of such phylogenetic hypotheses. Here we describe and analyze the first postcranial remains that can be attributed to C. lemuroides-an astragalus and three calcanei held in the collections of the Naturhistorisches Museum Basel that were likely recovered from Egerkingen over a century ago. Qualitative and multivariate morphometric analyses of these elements suggest that C. lemuroides was even more loris-like than European adapines such as Adapis and Leptadapis, and was not simply an adapine with an aberrant dentition. The astragalus of Caenopithecus is similar to that of younger Afradapis fromthe late Eocene of Egypt, and parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses that include the new tarsal data strongly support the placement of Afradapis and Caenopithecus as sister taxa to the exclusion of all other known adapiforms, thus implying that dispersal between Europe and Africa occurred during the middle Eocene. The new tarsal evidence, combined with previously known craniodental fossils, allows us to reconstruct C. lemuroides as having been an arboreal and highly folivorous 1.5-2.5 kg primate that likely moved slowly and deliberately with little or no capacity for acrobatic leaping, presumably maintaining consistent powerful grasps on branches in both above-branch and inverted postures. © 2015 Seiffert et al.","Adapidae; Afradapis; Africa; Astragalus; Calcaneus; Europe; Locomotion; Phylogeny; Strepsirrhini; Talus","animal tissue; ankle; arboreal species; Article; body posture; calcaneus; dentition; Eocene; fibula; flexor tendon; folivore; fossil primate; grip strength; joint mobility; morphometrics; nonhuman; Paleogene; parsimony analysis; phylogeny; prosimian; species; Switzerland; talus; tarsal bone; tibia","Seiffert, E.R.; Department of Anatomical Sciences, Stony Brook UniversityUnited States",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944715061

We propose a geometric methodology based on 3D photogrammetry usingmultiple cameras to provide subject-specific body segment parameters while minimizing the interaction time with the participants. A low-cost body scanner was built using multiple cameras and 3D point cloud data generated using structure from motion photogrammetric reconstruction algorithms. The point cloud was manually separated into body segments, and convex hulling applied to each segment to produce the required geometric outlines. The accuracy of the method can be adjusted by choosing the number of subdivisions of the body segments. The body segment parameters of six participants (four male and two female) are presented using the proposed method.

The Late Cretaceous is a keystone period to understand the origin and early radiation of Crocodylia, the group containing all extant lineages of crocodilians. Among the taxa described from the latest Cretaceous of Europe, the genus Allodaposuchus is one of the most common but also one of the most controversial. However, because of its fragmentary record, several issues regarding its phylogenetic emplacement and its ecology remain unsolved or unknown. The discovery of a single specimen attributed to Allodaposuchus, represented by both cranial and postcranial remains, from the Casa Fab`a site (Tremp Basin, NE Spain) in the lower red unit of the Tremp Fm. (earlyMaastrichtian, Late Cretaceous) offers a unique opportunity to deepen in the phylogenetic relationships of the group and its ecological features. Methods. The specimen is described in detail, and CT scan of the skull is performed in order to study the endocranial morphology as well as paratympanic sinuses configuration. In addition,myological and phylogenetic analyses are also carried out on the specimen for to shed light in ecological and phylogenetic issues, respectively. Results. The specimen described herein represents a new species, Allodaposuchus hulki sp. nov., closely related to the Romanian A. precedens. The CT scan of the skull revealed an unexpected paratympanic sinuses configuration. Allosaposuchus hulki exhibits an ""anterodorsal tympanic sinus"" not observed in any other extant or extinct crocodilian. The caudal tympanic recesses are extremely enlarged, and the expanded quadratic sinus seems to be connected to the middle-ear channel. Phylogenetic analyses confirmthe emplacement of the informal taxonomic group 'Allodaposuchia' at the base of Crocodylia, being considered the sister group of Borealosuchus and Planocraniidae. Discussion. Although this is a preliminary hypothesis, the unique paratympanic configuration displayed by A. hulki suggests that it could possess a high-specialized auditory system. Further, the large cranial cavities could help to reduce the weight of the cranium. Concerning the postcranial skeleton, Allodaposuchus hulki shows massive and robust vertebrae and forelimb bones, suggesting it could have a bulky body. The myological study performed on the anterior limb elements supports this interpretation. In addition, several bone and muscular features seem to point at a semi-erected position of the forelimbs during terrestrial locomotion. Taking all the above results into consideration, it seems plausible to suggest that A. hulki could conduct large incursions out of the water and have a semi-terrestrial lifestyle. © 2015 Blanco et al.","Allodaposuchus; Crocodylia; Endocranial morphology; Late Cretaceous; Locomotion; Paleoecology","Allodaposuchus hulki; anatomical concepts; Article; computer assisted tomography; crocodilian; extinct species; geographical variation (species); morphological trait; new species; nomenclature; nonhuman; paleontology; phylogeny; species identification; taxonomy; Upper Cretaceous; Borealosuchus; Crocodylidae (all crocodiles); Eusuchia","Sellés, A.G.; Institut Català de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont, Universitat Autònoma de BarcelonaSpain; email: albert.garcia@icp.cat",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940378209

The group consists of nearly 350 extant species, including kangaroos, koala, possums, and their relatives. Marsupials are an old lineage thought to have diverged from early therian mammals some 160 million years ago in the Jurassic, and have a remarkable evolutionary and biogeographical history, with extant species restricted to the Americas, mostly South America, and to Australasia. Although the group has been the subject of decades of phylogenetic research, the marsupial tree of life remains controversial, with most studies focusing on only a fraction of the species diversity within the infraclass. Here we present the first Methaterian species-level phylogeny to include 80% of the extant marsupial species and five nuclear and five mitochondrial markers obtained fromGenbank and a recently published retroposon matrix. Our primary goal is to provide a summary phylogeny that will serve as a tool for comparative research. We evaluate the extent to which the phylogeny recovers current phylogenetic knowledge based on the recovery of ""benchmark clades"" from prior studies-unambiguously supported key clades and undisputed traditional taxonomic groups. The Bayesian phylogenetic analyses recovered nearly all benchmark clades but failed to find support for the suborder Phalagiformes. The most significant difference with previous published topologies is the support for Australidelphia as a group containingMicrobiotheriidae, nested within American marsupials. However, a likelihood ratio test shows that alternative topologies with monophyletic Australidelphia and Ameridelphia are not significantly different than the preferred tree. Although further data are needed to solidify understanding ofMethateria phylogeny, the new phylogenetic hypothesis provided here offers a well resolved and detailed tool for comparative analyses, covering the majority of the known species richness of the group. © 2015 May-Collado et al.","Ameridelphia; Australidelphia; Dasyuromorphia; Didelphimorphia; Diprotodontia; Microbiotheria; Notoryctemorphia; Paucituberculata; Peramelemorphia","apolipoprotein B; BRCA1 protein; cytochrome b; cytochrome c oxidase; protamine; RAG1 protein; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase; RNA 12S; RNA 16S; von Willebrand factor; Article; Bayes theorem; cladistics; gene sequence; marsupial; mitochondrial gene; multigene family; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; phylogenetic tree root; phylogeny; retroposon; sequence analysis; species richness; Dasyuromorphia; Didelphimorphia; Diprotodontia; Macropodidae; Mammalia; Metatheria; Microbiotheria; Notoryctemorphia; Paucituberculata; Peramelemorphia; Phascolarctidae; Theria","May-Collado, L.J.; Department of Biology, University of VermontUnited States; email: lmaycollado@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926442734

Although numerous aspects of knee morphology are ancient and conserved among most tetrapods, the evolutionary occurrence of an ossified patella is highly variable. Among extant (crown clade) groups it is found in most birds, most lizards, the monotreme mammals and almost all placental mammals, but it is absent in most marsupial mammals as well as many reptiles. Here, we integrate data from the literature and first-hand studies of fossil and recent skeletal remains to reconstruct the evolution of the mammalian patella. We infer that bony patellae most likely evolved between four and six times in crown group Mammalia: in monotremes, in the extinct multituberculates, in one or more stem-mammal genera outside of therian or eutherian mammals and up to three times in therian mammals. Furthermore, an ossified patella was lost several times in mammals, not including those with absent hindlimbs: once or more in marsupials (with some re-acquisition) and at least once in bats. Our inferences about patellar evolution in mammals are reciprocally informed by the existence of several human genetic conditions in which the patella is either absent or severely reduced. Clearly, development of the patella is under close genomic control, although its responsiveness to its mechanical environment is also important (and perhaps variable among taxa). Where a bony patella is present it plays an important role in hindlimb function, especially in resisting gravity by providing an enhanced lever system for the knee joint. Yet the evolutionary origins, persistence and modifications of a patella in diverse groups with widely varying habits and habitats-from digging to running to aquatic, small or large body sizes, bipeds or quadrupeds-remain complex and perplexing, impeding a conclusive synthesis of form, function, development and genetics across mammalian evolution.

It is one of only two Late Triassic clades of large herbivorous archosaurs, and thus served a critical ecological role. Nonetheless, aetosaur phylogenetic relationships are still poorly understood, owing to an overreliance on osteoderm characters, which are often poorly constructed and suspected to be highly homoplastic. A new phylogenetic analysis of the Aetosauria, comprising 27 taxa and 83 characters, includes more than 40 new characters that focus on better sampling the cranial and endoskeletal regions, and represents the most comprenhensive phylogeny of the clade to date. Parsimony analysis recovered three most parsimonious trees; the strict consensus of these trees finds an Aetosauria that is divided into two main clades: Desmatosuchia, which includes the Desmatosuchinae and the Stagonolepidinae, and Aetosaurinae, which includes the Typothoracinae. As defined Desmatosuchinae now contains Neoaetosauroides engaeus and several taxa that were previously referred to the genus Stagonolepis, and a new clade, Desmatosuchini, is erected for taxa more closely related to Desmatosuchus. Overall support for some clades is still weak, and Partitioned Bremer Support (PBS) is applied for the first time to a strictly morphological dataset demonstrating that this weak support is in part because of conflict in the phylogenetic signals of cranial versus postcranial characters. PBS helps identify homoplasy among characters from various body regions, presumably the result of convergent evolution within discrete anatomical modules. It is likely that at least some of this character conflict results from different body regions evolving at different rates, which may have been under different selective pressures. © 2016 Parker.","Aetosauria; Chinle formation; Partitioned bremer support; Phylogeny; Pseudosuchia; Triassic","archosaur; body regions; cladistics; consensus; convergent evolution; crocodile; fauna; genus; homoplasy; morphological trait; parsimony analysis; phylogeny; sampling; species diversity; Upper Triassic","Parker, W.G.; Division of Resource Management, Petrified Forest National Park, United States; email: William_Parker@nps.gov",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955590565

Here we describe two new genera and species of basal phiomorphs, Birkamys korai and Mubhammys vadumensis, based on rostra and maxillary and mandibular remains from the terminal Eocene (~34 Ma) Fayum Locality 41 (L-41). Birkamys is the smallest known Paleogene hystricognath, has very simple molars, and, like derived Oligocene-to-Recent phiomorphs (but unlike contemporaneous and older taxa) apparently retained dP4/4 late into life, with no evidence for P4/4 eruption or formation. Mubhammys is very similar in dental morphology to Birkamys, and also shows no evidence for P4/4 formation or eruption, but is considerably larger. Though parsimony analysis with all characters equally weighted places Birkamys and Mubhammys as sister taxa of extant Thryonomys to the exclusion of much younger relatives of that genus, all other methods (standard Bayesian inference, Bayesian ``tip-dating,'' and parsimony analysis with scaled transitions between ""fixed"" and polymorphic states) place these species in more basal positions within Hystricognathi, as sister taxa of Oligocene-to-Recent phiomorphs. We also employ tip-dating as a means for estimating the ages of early hystricognath-bearing localities, many of which are not well-constrained by geological, geochronological, or biostratigraphic evidence. By simultaneously taking into account phylogeny, evolutionary rates, and uniform priors that appropriately encompass the range of possible ages for fossil localities, dating of tips in this Bayesian framework allows paleontologists to move beyond vague and assumption-laden ``stage of evolution'' arguments in biochronology to provide relatively rigorous age assessments of poorly-constrained faunas. This approach should become increasingly robust as estimates are combined from multiple independent analyses of distantly related clades, and is broadly applicable across the tree of life; as such it is deserving of paleontologists' close attention.

The so-called 'river dolphins' are now recognized as independent lineages that converged on similar morphological specializations (e.g., longirostry). In South America, the two endemic 'river dolphin' lineages form a clade (Inioidea), with closely related fossil inioids from marine rock units in the South Pacific and North Atlantic oceans. Here we describe a new genus and species of fossil inioid, Isthminia panamensis, gen. et sp. nov. from the late Miocene of Panama. The type and only known specimen consists of a partial skull, mandibles, isolated teeth, a right scapula, and carpal elements recovered from the Piña Facies of the Chagres Formation, along the Caribbean coast of Panama. Sedimentological and associated fauna from the Piña Facies point to fully marine conditions with high planktonic productivity about 6.1-5.8 million years ago (Messinian), pre-dating the final closure of the Isthmus of Panama. Along with ecomorphological data, we propose that Isthminia was primarily a marine inhabitant, similar to modern oceanic delphinoids. Phylogenetic analysis of fossil and living inioids, including new codings for Ischyrorhynchus, an enigmatic taxon from the late Miocene of Argentina, places Isthminia as the sister taxon to Inia, in a broader clade that includes Ischyrorhynchus andMeherrinia, a North American fossil inioid. This phylogenetic hypothesis complicates the possible scenarios for the freshwater invasion of the Amazon River system by stem relatives of Inia, but it remains consistent with a broader marine ancestry for Inioidea. Based on the fossil record of this group, along with Isthminia, we propose that a marine ancestor of Inia invaded Amazonia during late Miocene eustatic sea-level highs. © 2015 Pyenson et al.","Amazonia; Cetacea; Evolution; Fossil record; Inioidea; Neogene; Panama; River dolphins","Article; carpal bone; computer assisted tomography; dentition; dolphin; ecological niche; fossil animal; freshwater environment; geographic distribution; Isthminia panamensis; mandible; marine mammal; Neogene; new genus; nonhuman; paleontology; Panama; phylogeny; scapula; skull; species habitat; taxonomic identification; Western Hemisphere","Pyenson, N.D.; Department of Paleobiology, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian InstitutionUnited States",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944883120

Results of aerodynamic testing are mapped phylogenetically to examine how maneuvering characteristics correspond to tail shortening, forewing elaboration, and other morphological features. In the evolution of Paraves we observe shifts from static stability to inherently unstable aerial planforms; control effectiveness also migrated from tails to the forewings. These shifts suggest that a some degree of aerodynamic control and capacity for maneuvering preceded the evolution of a strong power stroke.

Our description principally relies on the anatomy of the ovuliferous scales, revealed through X-ray synchrotron microtomography (SRXMT) performed at the Diamond Light Source (UK). This study represents the first application of SRXMT to macro-scale silicified plant fossils, and demonstrates the significant advantages of this approach, which can resolve cellular structure over lab-based X-ray computed microtomography (XMT). The method enabled us to characterize tissues and precisely demarcate their boundaries, elucidating organ shape, and thus allowing an accurate assessment of affinities. The cones are broadly spherical (ca. 1.3 cm diameter), and are structured around a central axis with helically arranged bract/scale complexes, each of which bares a single ovule. A three-lobed ovuliferous scale and ovules enclosed within pocket-forming tissue, demonstrate an affinity with Cheirolepidiaceae. Details of vascular sclerenchyma bundles, integument structure, and the number and attachment of the ovules indicate greatest similarity to P. patagonica and P. carrii. This fossil develops our understanding of the dominant tree element of the Purbeck Fossil Forest, providing the first evidence for ovulate cheirolepidiaceous cones in Europe. Alongside recent discoveries in North America, this significantly extends the known palaeogeographic range of Pararaucaria, supporting a mid-palaeolatitudinal distribution in both Gondwana and Laurasia during the Late Jurassic. Palaeoclimatic interpretations derived from contemporaneous floras, climate sensitive sediments, and general circulation climate models indicate that Pararaucaria was a constituent of low diversity floras in semi-aridMediterranean-type environments. © 2014 Steart et al.","Diamond light source; Fossil forest; Pararaucaria; Purbeck; Tithonian","Article; conifer; fossil primate; geographic distribution; micro-computed tomography; morphology; nonhuman; Pararaucaria collinsonae; species distribution; synchrotron radiation; Cheirolepidiaceae; Coniferophyta","Kenrick, P.; Department of Earth Sciences, Invertebrates and Plants Division, Natural History MuseumUnited Kingdom",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84910034793

Alf Museum of Paleontology, Claremont, CA, United States","The vestibular system of the inner ear houses three semicircular canals-oriented on three nearly-orthogonal planes-that respond to angular acceleration stimuli. In recent years, the orientation of the lateral semicircular canal (LSC) has been regularly used to determine skull orientations for comparative purposes in studies of non-avian dinosaurs. Such orientations have been inferred based on fixing the LSC to a common set of coordinates (parallel to the Earth's horizon), given that the orientation to gravity of this sensory systemis assumed constant among taxa. Under this assumption, the LSC is used as a baseline (a reference system) both to estimate how the animals held their heads and to describe craniofacial variation among dinosaurs. However, the available data in living birds (extant saurischian dinosaurs) suggests that the orientation of the LSC in non-avian saurischian dinosaurs could have been very variable and taxon-specific. If such were the case, using the LSC as a comparative reference systemwould cause inappropriate visual perceptions of craniofacial organization, leading to significant descriptive inconsistencies among taxa. Here, we used Procrustes methods (GeometricMorphometrics), a suite of analytical tools that compares morphology on the basis of shared landmark homology, to show that the variability of LSC relative to skull landmarks is large (ca. 50°) and likely unpredictable, thus making it an inconsistent reference system for comparing and describing the skulls of saurischian (sauropodomorph and theropod) dinosaurs. In light of our results, the lateral semicircular canal is an inconsistent baseline for comparative studies of craniofacial morphology in dinosaurs. © 2013 Panagopoulos et al.","Anatomy; Dinosaurs; Geometric morphometrics; Inner ear; Reference system; Saurischia; Skull","anatomic landmark; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; comparative anatomy; craniofacial morphology; dinosaur; inner ear; nonhuman; semicircular canal; skull","Chiappe, L.M.; The Dinosaur Institute, Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, Los Angeles, CA, United States; email: chiappe@nhm.org",,,21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885125302

Despite their generally large body size, broad geographical distribution, and high species number, ziphiids thus remain poorly known. Furthermore, the evolutionary processes that have led to their extreme adaptations and impressive extant diversity are still poorly understood. Here we report new fossil beaked whales from the late Miocene of the Pisco Formation (southern Peru). The best preserved remains here described are referred to two new genera and species, the Messinian Chavinziphius maxillocristatus and the Tortonian Chimuziphius coloradensis, based on skull remains from two marine vertebrate-rich localities: Cerro Los Quesos and Cerro Colorado, respectively. C. maxillocristatus is medium sized retains a complete set of functional lower teeth, and bears robust rostral maxillary crests similar to those of the extant Berardius. By contrast, C. coloradensis is small and characterized by large triangular nasals and moderately thickened premaxillae that dorsally close the mesorostral groove. Both species confirm the high past diversity of Ziphiidae, the richest cetacean family in terms of the number of genera and species. Our new phylogenetic and biogeographical analyses depart markedly from earlier studies in dividing beaked whales into two major clades: the Messapicetus clade, which, along with other stem ziphiids, once dominated the southeastern Pacific and North Atlantic; and crown Ziphiidae, the majority of which are found in deep-water regions of the Southern Ocean, with possible subsequent dispersal both globally (Mesoplodon and Ziphius) and to the cooler waters of the northern oceans (Berardius and Hyperoodon). Despite this relatively clear separation, both lineages seem to follow similar evolutionary trends, including (1) a progressive reduction of dentition; (2) an increase in the compactness and thickness of the rostral bones; (3) similar changes in facial morphology (e.g., elevation of the vertex); and (4) an increase of body size.We suggest that these trends may be linked to a convergent ecological shift to deep diving and suction feeding. ï¿½ 2016 Bianucci et al.","Cetacea; Evolution; Fossil record; Neogene; Paleobiogeography; Peru; Ziphiidae","Article; Cetacea; comparative study; controlled study; evolution; frontal bone; mandible condyle; maxillary artery; Miocene; morphological trait; morphology; nonhuman; skull; whale","Bianucci, G.; Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra, Universitï¿½ di PisaItaly; email: bianucci@dst.unipi.it",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991388084

Starting in 1849 via descriptive approaches, it has been demonstrated that bone tissue and vascularisation types correlate with several biological variables such as ontogenetic stage, growth rate, and ecology. Mammalian bone displays a large variety of bone tissues and vascularisation patterns reaching from lamellar or parallel-fibred to fibrolamellar or woven-fibred bone, depending on taxon and individual age. Here we systematically review the knowledge and methods on cynodont and mammalian bone microstructure as well as palaeohistology and discuss potential future research fields and techniques. We present new data on the bone microstructure of two extant marsupial species and of several extinct continental and island placental mammals. Extant marsupials display mainly parallel-fibred primary bone with radial and oblique but mainly longitudinal vascular canals. Three juvenile specimens of the dwarf island hippopotamid Hippopotamus minor from the Late Pleistocene of Cyprus show reticular to plexiform fibrolamellar bone. The island murid Mikrotia magna from the Late Miocene of Gargano, Italy displays parallelfibred primary bone with reticular vascularisation and strong remodelling in the middle part of the cortex. Leithia sp., the dormouse from the Pleistocene of Sicily, is characterised by a primary bone cortex consisting of lamellar bone and a high amount of compact coarse cancellous bone. The bone cortex of the fossil continental lagomorph Prolagus oeningensis and three fossil species of insular Prolagus displays mainly parallel-fibred primary bone and reticular, radial as well as longitudinal vascularisation. Typical for large mammals, secondary bone in the giant rhinocerotoid Paraceratherium sp. fromthe LateOligocene of Turkey is represented by denseHaversian bone. The skeletochronological features of Sinomegaceros yabei, a large-sized deer from the Pleistocene of Japan closely related to Megaloceros, indicate a high growth rate. These examples and the synthesis of existing data show the potential of bone microstructure to reveal essential information on life history evolution. The bone tissue and the skeletochronological data of the sampled island species suggest the presence of various modes of bone histological modification and mammalian life history evolution on islands to depend on factors of island evolution such as island size, distance frommainland, climate, phylogeny, and time of evolution. © 2015 Kolb et al.","Bone tissue; Hippopotamus minor; Island evolution; Leithia; Mammals; Mikrotia; Palaeohistology; Paraceratherium; Prolagus; Sinomegaceros","Article; bone tissue; health care survey; Hippopotamus amphibius; histology; mammalian genetics; nonhuman; vascularization","Kolb, C.; Paläontologisches Institut und Museum, Universität ZürichSwitzerland; email: christian.kolb@pim.uzh.ch",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946196850

Changes in buoyant weight were normalised to colony surface areas as determined from both X-ray computed tomography and geometric estimation. Extension rates for A. yongei averaged 51±4mmy-1 and were comparable to rates reported for Acroporid coral at other tropical and high latitude locations. Mean rates of calcification for both A. yongei and P. damicornis in winter were comparable to both the preceding and following summers despite a mean seasonal temperature range of ~6 °C (18.2°-24.3 °C) and more than two-fold changes in the intensity of downwelling light.

A coral bleaching event observed in December 2013 provided further evidence of how coral at Rottnest Island are still vulnerable to the deleterious effects of episodic warming despite its high latitude location. Thus, while corals at Rottnest Island can sustain robust year-round rates of coral growth, even over cool winter temperatures of 18°-19 °C, there may be limits on the extent that such environments can provide refuge against the longer termimpacts of anthropogenic climate change. © 2015 Ross et al.","Calcification; Coral; Coral bleaching; Extension rates; High latitude; Seasonality; Western Australia","sea water; abiotic stress; Acropora; Acropora yongei; Article; Australia; climate change; computer assisted tomography; coral; coral reef; environmental temperature; latitude; nonhuman; perennial plant; pH; Pocillopora damicornis; seasonal variation; temperature stress; water temperature; Acropora yongei; Acroporidae; Anthozoa; Pocillopora damicornis","Ross, C.L.; UWA School of Earth and Environment and Oceans Institute, University of Western AustraliaAustralia; email: claire.ross@research.uwa.edu.au",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926433610

A large, almost complete, probably adult Allosaurus specimen from the Howe Stephens Quarry, Morrison Formation (Late Kimmeridgian-Early Tithonian), Wyoming, exhibits multiple pathologies. Pathologic bones include the left dentary, two cervical vertebrae, one cervical and several dorsal ribs, the left scapula, the left humerus, the right ischium, and two left pedal phalanges. These pathologies can be classifed as follows: the ffth cervical vertebra, the scapula, several ribs and the ischium are probably traumatic, and a callus on the shaft of the left pedal phalanx II-2 is probably traumatic-infectious. Traumatically fractured elements exposed to frequent movement (e.g., the scapula and the ribs) show a tendency to develop pseudarthroses instead of a callus. The pathologies in the lower jaw and a reduced extensor tubercle of the left pedal phalanx II-2 are most likely traumatic or developmental in origin. The pathologies on the fourth cervical are most likely developmental in origin or idiopathic, that on the left humerus could be traumatic, developmental, infectious or idiopathic, whereas the left pedal phalanx IV-1 is classifed as idiopathic. With exception of the ischium, all as traumatic/traumatic-infectious classifed pathologic elements show unambiguous evidences of healing, indicating that the respective pathologies did not cause the death of this individual. Alignment of the scapula and rib pathologies from the left side suggests that all may have been caused by a single traumatic event. The ischial fracture may have been fatal. The occurrence of multiple lesions interpreted as traumatic pathologies again underlines that large-bodied theropods experienced frequent injuries during life, indicating an active predatory lifestyle, and their survival perhaps supports a gregarious behavior for Allosaurus. Alternatively, the frequent survival of traumatic events could be also related to the presence of non-endothermic metabolic rates that allow survival based on sporadic food consumption or scavenging behavior. Signs of pathologies consistent with infections are scarce and locally restricted, indicating a successful prevention of the spread of pathogens, as it is the case in extant reptiles (including birds). © 2015 Foth et al.","Archosauria; Gregarious behavior; Jurassic; Osteomyelitis; Paleopathology; Pseudarthrosis; Theropoda","allosaurus; Article; cervical spine; developmental biology; dinosaur; fracture; humerus; ischial fracture; ischium; morphology; paleopathology; rib; scapula; toe phalanx; traumatic amputation; Allosaurus; Archosauria; Aves; Dinosauria; Reptilia; Theropoda","Foth, C.; SNBS, Bayerische Staatssammlung für Paläontologie und GeologieGermany",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930629719

Neochelys franzeni Schleich, 1993 is the only pleurodire or side-necked turtle from the middle Eocene, Messel Pit (the first UNESCO, World Natural Heritage Site in Germany, since 1995). The original description of the species is based on two specimens SMF ME 1091 (Holotype) and 715 (Paratype) housed at the Senckenberg Museum Frankfurt. The excellent preservation of complete and articulated skeletons of this species makes it a key taxon for understanding the evolution and phylogeny of the European Neochelys genus and its relationships with South American and African-Madagascar podocnemidids. Results. Five new specimens of Neochelys franzeni fromMessel Pit are described here, together with the redescription of SMF ME 1091 and 715. Specimens correspond to individuals of different ontogenetic stages showing conservative morphology from hatching to adults. A revised diagnosis for the species is presented here, together with its inclusion in a global phylogenetic analysis of Pelomedusoides that shows that this species and the whole Neochelys spp. is sister to the Erymnochelys madagascariensis-Peltocephalus dumerilianus clade within Podocnemididae. © 2015 Cadena.","Eocene; Germany; Messel Pit; Phylogeny; Pleurodira; Podocnemididae","Article; biodiversity; carapace; cervical spine; evolution; exoskeleton; fossil animal; Germany; limb; mandible; Neochelys franzeni; nonhuman; ontogeny; phylogeny; plastron; postcrania; skull; turtle; Erymnochelys madagascariensis; Pelomedusoides; Peltocephalus dumerilianus; Pleurodira; Podocnemididae; Testudines","Cadena, E.; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Senckenberg NaturmuseumGermany; email: cadenachelys@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940380726

An undeformed skull of the extinct marsupial, Diprotodon optatum, recovered from Pleistocene sediments at Bacchus Marsh in Victoria, represents the most complete and best preserved specimen of the species offering a unique opportunity to investigate functional anatomy. Computed tomography (CT) scans and digital reconstructions make it possible to visualise internal cranial anatomy and predict location and morphology of soft tissues, including muscles. This study resulted in a 3D digital reconstruction of the jaw adductor musculature of Diprotodon, revealing that the arrangement of muscles is similar to that of kangaroos and that the muscle actions were predominantly vertical. 3D digital muscle reconstructions provide considerable advantages over 2D reconstructions for the visualisation of the spatial arrangement of the individual muscles and the measurement of muscle properties (length, force vectors and volume).

In particular, the Late Jurassic of France and Germany records evidence for high diversity and possible sympatric atoposaurid species belonging to Alligatorellus, Alligatorium and Atoposaurus. However, atoposaurid taxonomy has received little attention, and many species are in need of revision. As such, this potentially high European diversity within a narrow spatiotemporal range might be a taxonomic artefact. Here we provide a taxonomic and anatomical revision of the Late Jurassic atoposaurid Alligatorellus. Initially described as A. beaumonti from the Kimmeridgian of Cerin, eastern France, additional material from the Tithonian of Solnhofen, south-eastern Germany, was subsequently referred to this species, with the two occurrences differentiated as A. beaumonti beaumonti and A. beaumonti bavaricus, respectively. We provide a revised diagnosis for the genus Alligatorellus, and note a number of anatomical differences between the French and German specimens, including osteoderm morphology and the configuration and pattern of sculpting of cranial elements. Consequently, we restrict the name Alligatorellus beaumonti to include only the French remains, and raise the rank of the German material to a distinct species: Alligatorellus bavaricus. A new diagnosis is provided for both species, and we suggest that a recently referred specimen froma coeval German locality cannot be conclusively referred to Alligatorellus. Although it has previously been suggested that Alligatorellus, Alligatorium and Atoposaurus might represent a single growth series of one species, we find no conclusive evidence to support this proposal, and provide a number of morphological differences to distinguish these three taxa that appear to be independent of ontogeny. Consequently, we interpret high atoposaurid diversity in the Late Jurassic island archipelago of western Europe as a genuine biological signal, with closely related species of Alligatorellus, Alligatorium and Atoposaurus in both French and German basins providing evidence for allopatric speciation, potentially driven by fluctuating highstand sea levels. © 2014 Tennant and Mannion.","Allopatric speciation; Atoposauridae; Biodiversity; Crocodylomorpha; Island rule; Lagerstätten; Neosuchia; Ontogeny; Osteoderms; Taxonomy","Alligatorellus; Alligatorellus bavaricus; Alligatorium; Alligatorium franconicum; Alligatorium meyeri; allopatry; animal identification; animal structures; Article; forelimb; fossil; geography; hindlimb; morphometrics; nonhuman; osteoderm; paleontology; pelvic girdle; preservation; reptile; shoulder girdle; skeleton; skin; skull; species diversity; taxonomy; Upper Jurassic; Crocodylomorpha","Tennant, J.P.; Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College LondonUnited Kingdom",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907701223

Here we examine the effectiveness of three hypothesized pathways for the evolution of the flight stroke, the forelimb motion that powers aerial locomotion, in a terrestrial setting across a range of stem and basal avians: Flap running, Wing Assisted Incline Running (WAIR), and wing-assisted leaping. Methods: Using biomechanical mathematical models based on known aerodynamic principals and in vivo experiments and ground truthed using extant avians we seek to test if an incipient flight stroke may have contributed sufficient force to permit flap running, WAIR, or leaping takeoffalong the phylogenetic lineage from Coelurosauria to birds. Results: None of these behaviours were found to meet the biomechanical threshold requirements before Paraves. Neither was there a continuous trend of refinement for any of these biomechanical performances across phylogeny nor a signal of universal applicability near the origin of birds. None of these flap-based locomotory models appear to have been a major influence on pre-flight character acquisition such as pennaceous feathers, suggesting non-locomotory behaviours, and less stringent locomotory behaviours such as balancing and braking, played a role in the evolution of the maniraptoran wing and nascent flight stroke. We find no support for widespread prevalence of WAIR in non-avian theropods, but can't reject its presence in large winged, small-bodied taxa like Microraptor and Archaeopteryx. Discussion: Using our first principles approach we find that ""near flight"" locomotor behaviors are most sensitive to wing area, and that non-locomotory related selection regimes likely expanded wing area well before WAIR and other such behaviors were possible in derived avians. These results suggest that investigations of the drivers for wing expansion and feather elongation in theropods need not be intrinsically linked to locomotory adaptations, and this separation is critical for our understanding of the origin of powered flight and avian evolution. © 2016 Dececchi et al.","Flap running; Flight; Flight stroke; Macroevolution; Maniraptora; Theropoda; WAIR","Archaeopteryx; Article; biomechanics; bird; body size; evolutionary adaptation; feather; forelimb; fossil animal; hindlimb; jumping; locomotion; mathematical model; morphological trait; nonhuman; paleontology; phylogeny; running; wing length","Dececchi, T.A.; Department of Geological Sciences, Queens UniversityCanada; email: td50@queensu.ca",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981532021

Megaraptorid dentition is largely restricted to isolated teeth found in association with skeletal parts; however, the in situ maxillary dentition of Megaraptor was recently described. A newly discovered right dentary pertaining to the Australovenator holotype preserves in situ dentition, permitting unambiguous characterisation of the dentary tooth morphology. The new jaw is virtually complete, with an overall elongate, shallow profile, and fifteen visible in situ teeth at varying stages of eruption. In situ teeth confirm Australovenator exhibited modest pseudoheterodonty, recurved lateral teeth with a serrate distal carina and reduced mesial carina, similar to other megaraptorids. Australovenator also combines of figure-of-eight basal cross-section with a lanceolate shape due to the presence of labial and lingual depressions and the lingual twist of the distal carina. Computed tomography and three-dimensional imagery provided superior characterisation of the dentary morphology and enabled an accurate reconstruction to a pre-fossilised state. The newly established dental morphology also afforded re-evaluation of isolated theropod teeth discovered at the Australovenator holotype locality and from several additional Winton Formation localities. The isolated Winton teeth are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the in situ dentary teeth of Australovenator, but are also morphometrically similar to Abelisauridae, Allosauridae, Coelophysoidea, Megalosauridae and basal Tyrannosauroidea. Qualitative characters, however, clearly distinguish the teeth of Australovenator and the isolated Winton teeth from all other theropods. Evidence from teeth suggests megaraptorids were the dominant predators in the Winton Formation, which contrasts with other penecontemporaneous Gondwanan ecosystems. © 2015 White et al.","Australian dinosaurs; Australovenator wintonensis; Cretaceous; Dentary; Megaraptorid; Teeth; Theropod; Winton formation","Article; Australovenator wintonensis; computer assisted tomography; dinosaur; ecosystem; geology; multivariate analysis; nonhuman; tooth crown; voxel based morphometry","White, M.A.; Mechanical Engineering, University of NewcastleAustralia; email: fossilised@hotmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951112437

Such data have implications for understanding phenotypic variation in the mammalian feeding apparatus, particularly with respect to linking jaw form to diet-induced repetitive loading. Results indicate that chewing frequency (chews/s) is independent of food properties, whereas chewing investment (chews/g) and chewing duration(s), which are proportional to repetitive loading of the jaws, are positively related to food stiffness and toughness. In comparisons of displacement-limited and stress-limited fragmentation indices, which respectively characterize the intraoral breakdown of tough and stiff foods, increases in chewing investment and duration are linked solely to stiffness. This suggests that stiffer foods engender higher peak loads and increased cyclical loading. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom by demonstrating that toughness does not, by itself, underlie increases in cyclical loading and loading duration. Instead, tough foods may be associated with such jaw loading patterns because they must be processed in greater volumes owing to their lower nutritive quality and for longer periods of time to increase oral exposure to salivary chemicals. © 2015 Ravosa et al.","Chewing parameters; Cyclical/repetitive loading; Diet; Food mechanical properties; Jaw loading patterns; Mammals; Mandibular morphology; Masticatory system; Rabbits","adult; animal experiment; animal model; Article; biomechanics; controlled study; elasticity; feeding apparatus; feeding behavior; feeding ecology; food intake; hardness; jaw movement; mandible condyle; mastication; mechanical stress; nonhuman; phenotypic variation; Young modulus","Ravosa, M.J.; Departments of Biological Sciences, Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering and Anthropology, University of Notre DameUnited States; email: Matthew.J.Ravosa.1@nd.edu",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84948976383

However, little empirical data is available on the actual growth and form of shells, as these are hard to quantify and examine simultaneously. To address these issues, we studied the growth and formof a land snail that has an irregularly coiled and heavily ornamented shell-Plectostoma concinnum. The growth data were collected in a natural growth experiment and the actual form changes of the aperture during shell ontogeny were quantified. We used an ontogeny axis that allows data of growth and formto be analysed simultaneously. Then, we examined the association between the growth and the form during three different whorl growing phases, namely, the regular coiled spire phase, the transitional constriction phase, and the distortedly-coiled tuba phase. In addition, we also explored the association between growth rate and the switching between whorl growing mode and rib growing mode. As a result, we show how the changes in the aperture ontogeny profiles in terms of aperture shape, size and growth trajectory, and the changes in growth rates, are associated with the different shell forms at different parts of the shell ontogeny. These associations suggest plausible constraints that underlie the three different shell ontogeny phases and the two different growth modes. We found that the mechanism behind the irregularly coiled-shell is the rotational changes of the animal's body and mantle edge with respect to the previously secreted shell. Overall, we propose that future study should focus on the role of the mantle and the columellarmuscular systemin the determination of shell form. © 2014 Liew et al.","3D morphometrics; Borneo; Commarginal ribs; Heteropmorph; Limestone hills; Malaysia; Open coiling; Opisthostoma; Radial ribs","animal experiment; animal shell; article; growth curve; growth rate; mollusc; nonhuman; ontogeny; Plectostoma concinnum; rib; scanning electron microscopy; scoring system; snail; three dimensional imaging; tomography","Liew, T.-S.; Institute Biology Leiden, Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands; email: thorsengliew@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903825819

Yet, the functional demands associated with jumping and swimming may not be that different as suggested by studies with semi-aquatic frogs. Here, we explore whether features previously identified as indicative of good burst swimming performance also predict jumping performance in a highly aquatic frog, Xenopus tropicalis. Moreover, we test whether the morphological determinants of jumping performance are similar in the two sexes and whether jumping performance differs in the two sexes. Finally we test whether jumping capacity is positively associated with burst swimming and terrestrial endurance capacity in both sexes. Our results show sex-specific differences in jumping performance when correcting for differences in body size. Moreover, the features determining jumping performance are different in the two sexes. Finally, the relationships between different performance traits are sex-dependent as well with females, but not males, showing a trade-offbetween peak jumping force and the time jumped to exhaustion. This suggests that different selective pressures operate on the two sexes, with females being subjected to constraints on locomotion due to their greater body mass and investment in reproductive capacity. In contrast, males appear to invest more in locomotor capacity giving themhigher performance for a given body size compared to females. © 2014 Herrel et al.","Frog; Jumping; Locomotion; Sexual dimorphism; Trade-off","acceleration; amplifier; animal experiment; Anura; Article; body height; body mass; body weight; endurance; exhaustion; female; foot; force; hindlimb; iliac bone; jumping; male; nonhuman; performance; pressure; reproduction; sex difference; Xenopus tropicalis; Anura; Xenopus tropicalis","Herrel, A.; UMR 7179, CNRS/MNHN, Département d'Ecologie et de Gestion de la BiodiversitéFrance",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84911392745

Despite recent advances in whole-genome sequencing, microsatellite markers have remained one of the most powerful tools for a myriad of population genetic approaches. Here, we used the 454 sequencing technique to develop microsatellite loci in the fire coral Millepora platyphylla, an important reefbuilder of Indo-Pacific reefs. We tested the cross-species amplification of these loci in five other species of the genus Millepora and analysed its success in correlation with the genetic distances between species using mitochondrial 16S sequences. We succeeded in discovering fifteen microsatellite loci in our target species M. platyphylla, among which twelve were polymorphic with 2-13 alleles and a mean observed heterozygosity of 0.411. Cross-species amplification in the five other Millepora species revealed a high probability of amplification success (71%) and polymorphism (59%) of the loci. Our results show no evidence of decreased heterozygosity with increasing genetic distance. However, only one locus enabled measures of genetic diversity in the Caribbean species M. complanata due to high proportions of null alleles for most of the microsatellites. This result indicates that our novel markers may only be useful for the Indo-Pacific species of Millepora. Measures of genetic diversity revealed significant linkage disequilibrium, moderate levels of observed heterozygosity (0.323-0.496) and heterozygote deficiencies for the Indo-Pacific species. The accessibility to new polymorphic microsatellite markers for hydrozoan Millepora species creates new opportunities for future research on processes driving the complexity of their colonisation success on many Indo-Pacific reefs. © 2017 Dubé et al.","Cross-species transferability; Genetic distance; Genetic diversity; Microsatellites; Millepora","Caribbean; coral; gene amplification; gene frequency; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic distance; genetic variability; genus; heterozygote; human; human experiment; Hydrozoa; microsatellite marker; mitochondrion; nonhuman; null allele; probability; target organism","Dubé, C.E.; EPHE, PSL Research University, UPVD, CNRS, USR 3278 CRIOBEFrance; email: caroline.dube.qc@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013781375

Their superficial resemblance to longirostrine (long-snouted) crocodylians, such as gharials, has often been used in the past to infer ecological and behavioural convergence between the two groups. Although more than thirty species of phytosaur are currently recognised, little is known about the endocranial anatomy of this clade. Here, we describe the endocranial anatomy (including the brain, inner ear, neurovascular structures and sinus systems) of the two non-mystriosuchine phytosaurs Parasuchus angustifrons (=""Paleorhinus angustifrons"") and Ebrachosuchus neukami from the Late Triassic of Germany based on digital reconstructions. Results show that the endocasts of both taxa are very similar to each other in their rostrocaudally elongate morphology, with long olfactory tracts, weakly demarcated cerebral regions and dorsoventrally short endosseous labyrinths. In addition, several sinuses, including large antorbital sinuses and prominent dural venous sinuses, were reconstructed. Comparisons with the endocranial anatomy of derived phytosaurs indicate that Phytosauria is united by the presence of elongate olfactory tracts and longitudinally arranged brain architecture-characters which are also shared with Crocodyliformes. However, a substantial morphological variability is observed in the cephalic and pontine flexure and the presence of a pineal organ across the different phytosaur species. These results suggest that the endocranial anatomy in Phytosauria generally follows a plesiomorphic pattern, with moderate variation within the clade likely resulting from divergent sensory and behavioural adaptations. © 2016 Lautenschlager and Butler.","3D visualisation; Archosauria; Digital endocast; Ebrachosuchus neukami; Parasuchus angustifrons; Pseudosuchia","anatomy; cladistics; cranial sinus; crocodilian; fossil; Germany; inner ear; morphology; olfactory tract; pineal body; Upper Triassic","Lautenschlager, S.; School of Earth Sciences, University of BristolUnited Kingdom; email: glzsl@bristol.ac.uk",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981513518

Their hard skeletons form the substratum of reef ecosystems and confer on corals their remarkable diversity of shapes. Corallimorpharians are non-calcifying, close relatives of scleractinian corals, and the evolutionary relationship between these two groups is key to understanding the evolution of calcification in the coral lineage. One pivotal question is whether scleractinians are a monophyletic group, paraphyly being an alternative possibility if corallimorpharians are corals that have lost their ability to calcify, as is implied by the ""naked-coral"" hypothesis. Despite major efforts, relationships between scleractinians and corallimorpharians remain equivocal and controversial. Although the complete mitochondrial genomes of a range of scleractinians and corallimorpharians have been obtained, heterogeneity in composition and evolutionary rates means that mitochondrial sequences are insufficient to understand the relationship between these two groups. To overcome these limitations, transcriptome data were generated for three representative corallimorpharians. These were used in combination with sequences available for a representative range of scleractinians to identify 291 orthologous single copy protein-coding nuclear markers. Unlike the mitochondrial sequences, these nuclear markers do not display any distinct compositional bias in their nucleotide or amino-acid sequences. A range of phylogenomic approaches congruently reveal a topology consistent with scleractinian monophyly and corallimorpharians as the sister clade of scleractinians.

M. hunteri closely resembles M. durinasus, differing primarily in its somewhat less distally expanded compound posterior process of the tympanoperiotic.

A number of factors have long been considered to drive skull shape, including phylogeny, dietary preferences and functional constraints. However, heterochrony is increasingly being recognized as an important factor in dinosaur evolution. In order to quantitatively analyse the impact of heterochrony on saurischian skull shape, we analysed five ontogenetic trajectories using two-dimensional geometric morphometrics in a phylogenetic framework. This allowed for the comparative investigation of main ontogenetic shape changes and the evaluation of how heterochrony affected skull shape through both ontogenetic and phylogenetic trajectories. Using principal component analyses and multivariate regressions, it was possible to quantify different ontogenetic trajectories and evaluate them for evidence of heterochronic events allowing testing of previous hypotheses on cranial heterochrony in saurischians. We found that the skull shape of the hypothetical ancestor of Saurischia likely led to basal Sauropodomorpha through paedomorphosis, and to basal Theropoda mainly through peramorphosis. Paedomorphosis then led from Orionides to Avetheropoda, indicating that the paedomorphic trend found by previous authors in advanced coelurosaurs may extend back into the early evolution of Avetheropoda. Not only are changes in saurischian skull shape complex due to the large number of factors that affected it, but heterochrony itself is complex, with a number of possible reversals throughout non-avian saurischian evolution. In general, the sampling of complete ontogenetic trajectories including early juveniles is considerably lower than the sampling of single adult or subadult individuals, which is a major impediment to the study of heterochrony on non-avian dinosaurs. Thus, the current work represents an exploratory analysis. To better understand the cranial ontogeny and the impact of heterochrony on skull evolution in saurischians, the data set that we present here must be expanded and complemented with further sampling from future fossil discoveries, especially of juvenile individuals. © 2016 Foth et al.","Dinosauria; Evolution; Geometric morphometrics; Heterochrony; Ontogeny; Sauropodomorpha; Skull shape; Theropoda","adolescent; adult; dinosaur; exploratory research; fossil; juvenile; morphometrics; ontogeny; principal component analysis; quantitative study; sampling; skull; subadult","Foth, C.; SNSB, Bayerische Staatssammlung für Paläontologie und GeologieGermany; email: foth@gmx.net",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955572800

Save for mandibular translation, these adaptations are not seen in extant archosaurs or lepidosaurs. In contrast, some ornithischian dinosaurs show evidence of precise dental occlusion, habitual intraoral trituration and complex jaw motion. To date, however, a robust understanding of the diversity of jaw mechanics within non-avian dinosaurs, and its comparison with other vertebrates, remains unrealized. Large dental batteries, well-developed dental wear facets, and robust jaws suggests that neoceratopsian (horned) dinosaurs were capable chewers. But, biomechanical analyses have assumed a relatively simple, scissor-like (orthal) jaw mechanism for these animals. New analyses of dental microwear, presented here, show curvilinear striations on the teeth of Leptoceratops. These features indicate a rostral to caudal orbital motion of the mandible during chewing. Arostrocaudal mandibular orbit is seen in multituberculates, haramiyid allotherians, and some rodents, and its identification in Leptoceratops gracilis is the first evidence of complex, mammal-like chewing in a ceratopsian dinosaur. The term circumpalinal is here proposed to distinguish this new style of chewing from other models of ceratopsian mastication that also involve a palinal component. This previously unrecognized complexity in dinosaurian jaw mechanics indicates that some neoceratopsian dinosaurs achieved a mammalian level of masticatory efficiency through novel adaptive solutions. © 2016 Varriale.","Ceratopsia; Chewing; Dental microwear; Dinosauria; Jaw action; Jaw mechanics; Mastication; Ornithischia","dinosaur; mandible; mastication; model; motion; orbit; rodent; tooth","Varriale, F.J.; Department of Biology, King's CollegeUnited States; email: frankvarriale@kings.edu",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981484533

Various physical and chemical techniques have been used to identify and profile different plant resins and have then been applied to fossilized resins (ambers), to try to detect their parent plant affinities and understand the process of polymerization, with varying levels of success. Here we focus on resins produced fromtoday's most resinous conifer family, the Araucariaceae, which are thought to be the parent plants of some of the Southern Hemisphere's fossil resin deposits. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the resins of closely related Araucariaceae species were examined to test whether they could be distinguished at genus and species level and whether the results could then be used to infer the parent plant of a New Zealand amber. The resin FTIR spectra are distinguishable from each other, and the three Araucaria species sampled produced similar FTIR spectra, to whichWollemia resin is most similar. Interspecific variability of the FTIR spectra is greatest in the three Agathis species tested. The New Zealand amber sample is similar in key shared features with the resin samples, but it does differ from the extant resin samples in key distinguishing features, nonetheless it is most similar to the resin of Agathis australis in this dataset. However on comparison with previously published FTIR spectra of similar aged amber and older (Eocene) resinites both found in coals from New Zealand and fresh Agathis australis resin, our amber has some features that imply a relatively immature resin, which was not expected froman amber of the Miocene age. © 2015 Seyfullah et al.","Amber; Araucariaceae; FTIR; New Caledonia; New Zealand","amber; araucarian resin; lignite; plant resin; unclassified drug; araucariaceae; Article; conifer; geology; infrared spectroscopy; Miocene; New Zealand; nonhuman; paleontology; Agathis (conifer); Agathis australis; Araucaria; Araucariaceae; Coniferophyta; Embryophyta; Gymnospermae; Magnoliophyta","Seyfullah, L.J.; Department of Geobiology, University of GöttingenGermany",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84935488286

In addition, although the focus on volumetric analyses for ammonites has been increasing recently with the development of computed tomographic technology, the intraspecific variation of volumetric parameters has never been examined. To investigate the intraspecific variation of the phragmocone chamber volumes throughout ontogeny, 30 specimens of Recent Nautilus pompilius and two Middle Jurassic ammonites (Normannites mitis) were reconstructed using computed tomography and grinding tomography, respectively. Both of the ontogenetic growth trajectories from the two Normannites demonstrate logistic increase. However, a considerable difference in Normannites has been observed between their entire phragmocone volumes (cumulative chamber volumes), in spite of their similar morphology and size. Ontogenetic growth trajectories from Nautilus also show a high variation. Sexual dimorphism appears to contribute significantly to this variation. Finally, covariation between chamber widths and volumes was examined. The results illustrate the strategic difference in chamber construction between Nautilus and Normannites.

This is commonly justified by the absence of a non-pterodactyloid footprint record, suggestions that the expansive uropatagia common to early pterosaurs would restrict hindlimb motion in walking or running, and the presence of sprawling forelimbs in some species. Here, these arguments are re-visited and mostly found problematic. Restriction of limb mobility is not a problem faced by extant animals with extensive fight membranes, including species which routinely utilise terrestrial locomotion. The absence of non-pterodactyloid footprints is not necessarily tied to functional or biomechanical constraints. As with other fully terrestrial clades with poor ichnological records, biases in behaviour, preservation, sampling and interpretation likely contribute to the deficit of early pterosaur ichnites. Suggestions that non-pterodactyloids have slender, mechanically weak limbs are demonstrably countered by the proportionally long and robust limbs of many Triassic and Jurassic species. Novel assessments of pterosaur forelimb anatomies conflict with notions that all non-pterodactyloids were obligated to sprawling forelimb postures. Sprawling forelimbs seemappropriate for species with ventrally-restricted glenoid articulations (seemingly occurring in rhamphorhynchines and campylognathoidids). However, some early pterosaurs, such as Dimorphodon macronyx and wukongopterids, have glenoid arthrologies which are not ventrally restricted, and their distal humeri resemble those of pterodactyloids. It seems fully erect forelimb stances were possible in these pterosaurs, and may be probable given proposed correlation between pterodactyloid-like distal humeral morphology and forces incurred through erect forelimb postures. Further indications of terrestrial habits include antungual sesamoids, which occur in the manus and pes anatomy of many early pterosaur species, and only occur elsewhere in terrestrial reptiles, possibly developing through frequent interactions of large claws with firm substrates. It is argued that characteristics possibly associated with terrestriality are deeply nested within Pterosauria and not restricted to Pterodactyloidea as previously thought, and that pterodactyloid-like levels of terrestrial competency may have been possible in at least some early pterosaurs. © 2015 Witton.","Dimorphodon macronyx; Functional morphology; Locomotion; Palaeoecology; Pterosaurs; Terrestrial locomotion","Article; Chordata; Dimorphodon macronyx; fossil animal; glenoid cavity; locomotion; nonhuman; paleontology; pterosaur; Rhamphorhynchus; sesamoid bone","Witton, M.P.; School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of PortsmouthUnited Kingdom",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945178425

The only cranial material confidently referred to this species are three fragmentary bones preserved with the paratype, hindering attempts to understand the systematic relationships of this taxon within Neornithischia. Here the cranial anatomy of T. neglectus is fully described for the first time based on two specimens that include well-preserved cranial material (NCSM 15728 and TLAM.BA.2014.027.0001). Visual inspection of exposed cranial elements of these specimens is supplemented by detailed CT data from NCSM 15728 that enabled the examination of otherwise unexposed surfaces, facilitating a complete description of the cranial anatomy of this species. The skull of T. neglectus displays a unique combination of plesiomorphic and apomorphic traits. The premaxillary and 'cheek' tooth morphologies are relatively derived, though less so than the condition seen in basal iguanodontians, suggesting that the high tooth count present in the premaxillae, maxillae, and dentaries may be related to the extreme elongation of the skull of this species rather than a retention of the plesiomorphic condition. The morphology of the braincase most closely resembles the iguanodontians Dryosaurus and Dysalotosaurus, especially with regard to the morphology of the prootic. One autapomorphic feature is recognized for the first time, along with several additional cranial features that differentiate this species from the closely related and contemporaneous Thescelosaurus assiniboiensis. Published phylogenetic hypotheses of neornithischian dinosaur relationships often differ in the placement of the North American taxon Parksosaurus, with some recovering a close relationship with Thescelosaurus and others with the South American taxon Gasparinisaura, but never both at the same time. The new morphological observations presented herein, combined with re-examination of the holotype of Parksosaurus, suggest that Parksosaurus shares a closer relationship with Thescelosaurus than with Gasparinisaura, and that many of the features previously cited to support a relationship with the latter taxon are either also present in Thescelosaurus, are artifacts of preservation, or are the result of incomplete preparation and inaccurate interpretation of specimens. Additionally, the overall morphology of the skull and lower jaws of both Thescelosaurus and Parksosaurus also closely resemble the Asian taxa Changchunsaurus andHaya, though the interrelationships of these taxa have yet to be tested in a phylogenetic analysis that includes these new morphological data for T. neglectus. © 2014 Boyd.","Dinosauria; Hell creek formation; Maastrichtian; Neornithischia; Ornithischia; Thescelosaurus","anatomical variation; animal structures; Article; bone structure; computer assisted tomography; craniofacial morphology; dinosaur; fossil animal; functional anatomy; geographic distribution; nonhuman; paleontology; phylogeny; plesiomorphy; species differentiation; species identification; Thescelosaurus neglectus; Dinosauria; Ornithischia","Boyd, C.A.; Department of Geology and Geological Engineering Sciences, South Dakota School of Mines and TechnologyUnited States",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84911376238

Organismal design, with modularity as a concept, offers insights into the evolution of therapsids, a group that experienced profound anatomical transformations throughout the past 270 Ma, eventually leading to the evolution of the mammalian bauplan. However, the anatomy of some therapsid groups remains obscure. Gorgonopsian braincase anatomy is poorly known and many anatomical aspects of the brain, cranial nerves, vasculature, and osseous labyrinth, remain unclear. We analyzed two gorgonopsian specimens, GPIT/RE/7124 and GPIT/RE/7119, using propagation phase contrast synchrotron micro-computed tomography. The lack of fusion between many basicranial and occipital bones in GPIT/RE/7124, which is an immature specimen, allowed us to reconstruct its anatomy and ontogenetic sequence, in comparison with the mature GPIT/RE/7119, in great detail. We explored the braincase and rendered various skull cavities. Notably, we found that there is a separate ossification between what was previously referred to as the ''parasphenoid'' and the basioccipital. We reinterpreted this element as a posterior ossification of the basisphenoid: the basipostsphenoid. Moreover, we show that the previously called ''parasphenoid'' is in fact the co-ossification of the dermal parasphenoid and the endochondral basipresphenoid. In line with previous descriptions, the anatomy of the osseous labyrinth is rendered in detail, revealing a unique discoid morphology of the horizontal semicircular canal, rather than toroidal, probably due to architectural constraints of the ossification of the opisthotic and supraoccipital. In addition, the orientation of the horizontal semicircular canal suggests that gorgonopsians had an anteriorly tilted alert head posture. The morphology of the brain endocast is in accordance with the more reptilian endocast shape of other non-mammaliaform neotherapsids. © 2017 Araújo et al.","Brain; Braincase; Gorgonopsian; Homology; Mammals; Modularity; Synchrotron; Therapsid; Vasculature; Vestibular organ","anatomical variation; Article; basipostsphenoid bone; brain endocast bone; computer assisted tomography; cranial nerve; evolution; exoccipital bone; fossil animal; Gorgonopsia; interparietal bone; mammal; neuroanatomy; nonhuman; opisthotic bone; orbitosphenoid bone; paleobiology; parasphenoid basipresphenoid bone; skull; squamosal bone; supraoccipital bone; tabular bone; vascularization","Araújo, R.; Instituto Superior Técnico, Instituto de Plasmas e Fusão Nuclear, Universidade de LisboaPortugal; email: ricardo.araujo@tecnico.ulisboa.pt",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017378215

Its first appearance is therefore a central problem in human evolution. Atelids, which use the tail during suspension, exhibit demonstrable lordosis and can achieve full extension of their hind limbs during terrestrial upright stance. Although obviously homoplastic with hominids, the pelvic mechanisms facilitating lordosis appear largely similar in both taxa with respect to abbreviation of upper iliac height coupled with broad sacral alae. Both provide spatial separation of the most caudal lumbar(s) from the iliac blades. A broad sacrum is therefore a likely facet of earliest hominid bipedality. All tailed monkeys have broad alae. By contrast all extant apes have very narrow sacra, which promote ""trapping"" of their most caudal lumbars to achieve lower trunk rigidity during suspension. The alae in the tailless proconsul Ekembo nyanzae appear to have been quite broad, a character state that may have been primitive in Miocene hominoids not yet adapted to suspension and, by extension, exaptive for earliest bipedality in the hominid/panid last common ancestor.

Yet, the significance of the postcranium in crocodyliforms evolution is reflected in the great lifestyle diversity exhibited by the group, with members ranging from terrestrial animals to semi-aquatic and fully marine forms. Recently, studies have emphasized the importance of the postcranium. Following this trend, here we present a detailed description of the postcranial elements of Pissarrachampsa sera (Mesoeucrocodylia, Baurusuchidae), from the Adamantina Formation (Bauru Group, Late Cretaceous of Brazil). The preserved elements include dorsal vertebrae, partial forelimb, pelvic girdle, and hindlimbs. Comparisons with the postcranial anatomy of baurusuchids and other crocodyliforms, together with body-size and mass estimates, lead to a better understanding of the paleobiology of Pissarrachampsa sera, including its terrestrial lifestyle and its role as a top predator. Furthermore, the complete absence of osteoderms in P. sera, a condition previously known only in marine crocodyliforms, suggests osteoderms very likely played a minor role in locomotion of baurusuchids, unlike other groups of terrestrial crocodyliforms. Finally, a phylogenetic analysis including the newly recognized postcranial features was carried out, and exploratory analyses were performed to investigate the influence of both cranial and postcranial characters in the phylogeny of Crocodyliformes. Our results suggest that crocodyliform relationships are mainly determined by cranial characters. However, this seems to be a consequence of the great number of missing entries in the data set with only postcranial characters and not of the lack of potential (or synapomorphies) for this kind of data to reflect the evolutionary history of Crocodyliformes. ï¿½ 2016 Godoy et al.","Adamantina formation; Bauru group; Baurusuchidae; Ecological habit; Fossil; Mesoeucrocodylia; Notosuchia; Osteoderms; Paleontology; Phylogenetic bias",,"Godoy, P.L.; School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of BirminghamUnited Kingdom; email: pedrolorenagodoy@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84971558853

The only other avialans known to exhibit an elongate rostrum with the facial margin comprised primarily of maxilla are derived ornithurines previously placed phylogenetically as among the closest outgroups to the avian crown clade as well as one derived enantiornithine clade. We find that, consistent with a proposed developmental shift in cranial ontogeny late in avialan evolution, this elongate rostrum is achieved through elongation of the maxilla while the premaxilla remains only a small part of rostral length. Thus, only in Late Cretaceous ornithurine taxa does the premaxilla begin to play a larger role. The rostral and postcranial proportions of Changzuiornis suggest an ecology not previously reported in Ornithurae; the only other species with an elongate rostrum are two marine Late Cretacous taxa interpreted as showing a derived picivorous diet. © 2016 Huang et al.","Avialae; Fossil; Jehol Biota; Ontogeny; Ornithurae","bird; China; cladistics; diet; ecology; face; Lower Cretaceous; maxilla; new species; ontogeny; Upper Cretaceous","Clarke, J.A.; Department of Geological Sciences, Jackson School of Geoscience, University of Texas at AustinUnited States; email: julia_clarke@jsg.utexas.edu",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963948563

It derived from the Gerdemann & Co. brickworks clay pit near Gronau (Westfalen) in North Rhine- Westphalia, northwestern Germany. Stratigraphically this locality formed part of the classic European ""Wealden facies,"" but is now more formally attributed to the uppermost strata of the Bï¿½ckeberg Group (upper Berriasian). Since its initial description in 1914, the type skeleton of B. brancai has suffered damage both during, and after WWII. Sadly, these mishaps have resulted in the loss of substantial information, in particular many structures of the cranium and limb girdles, which are today only evidenced from published text and/or illustrations. This non-confirmable data has, however, proven crucial for determining the relationships of B. brancai within Plesiosauria: either as an early long-necked elasmosaurid, or a member of the controversial Early Cretaceous leptocleidid radiation. To evaluate these competing hypotheses and compile an updated osteological compendium, we undertook a comprehensive examination of the holotype as it is now preserved, and also assessed other Bï¿½ckeberg Group plesiosaurian fossils to establish a morphological hypodigm. Phylogenetic simulations using the most species-rich datasets of Early Cretaceous plesiosaurians incorporating revised scores for B. brancai, together with a second recently named Bï¿½ckeberg Group plesiosaurian Gronausaurus wegneri (Hampe, 2013), demonstrated that referral of these taxa to Leptocleididae was not unanimous, and that the topological stability of this clade is tenuous. In addition, the trait combinations manifested by B. brancai and G. wegneri were virtually identical. We therefore conclude that these monotypic individuals are ontogenetic morphs and G. wegneri is a junior synonym of B. brancai. Finally, anomalies detected in the diagnostic features for other ""Wealden"" plesiosaurians have prompted reconsiderations of interspecies homology versus intraspecific variability. We therefore propose that the still unresolved taxonomy of B. brancai should emphasize only those character states evident in the examinable fossil material, and specifically accommodate for growth-related modifications delimited via osteologically mature referred specimens. ï¿½ 2016 Sachs et al.","Berriasian; Bï¿½ckeberg Group; Elasmosauridae; Gronausaurus wegneri; Leptocleididae; Ontogenetic variability; Wealden facies","Berriasian; character state; cladistics; fossil; Germany; limb; nonhuman; patient referral; radiation; skull","Sachs, S.; Naturkundemuseum Bielefeld, Abteilung GeowissenschaftenGermany",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007356340

This animal is the only known pre-Campanian non-lambeosaurine hadrosaurid, and the most complete hadrosauroid known from Appalachia. E. orientalis possesses a mosaic of plesiomorphic and derived characters in the context of Hadrosauroidea. Characters shared with basal hadrosauroids include a short and sloping maxillary ectopterygoid shelf, caudally prominent maxillary jugal process, one functional tooth per alveolus on the maxillary occlusal plane, a jugal rostral process with a shallow caudodorsal margin and medioventrally facing articular facet, a vertical dentary coronoid process with a poorly expanded apex, and tooth crowns with accessory ridges. Derived characters shared with other hadrosaurids include a circumnarial depression compartmented into three fossae (as in brachylophosaurins and Edmontosaurus), a thin everted premaxillary oral margin (as in Gryposaurus, Prosaurolophus, and Saurolophus), and a maxilla with a deep and rostrocaudally extensive rostrodorsal region with a steeply sloping premaxillary margin (as in Gryposaurus). Eotrachodon orientalis differs primarily from the other hadrosauroid from the Mooreville Chalk of Alabama, Lophorhothon atopus, in having a slender and crestless nasal whose caudodorsal margin is not invaded by the circumnarial depression. Hadrosaurus foulkii, the only other known hadrosaurid from Appalachia, is distinct from E. orientalis in having dentary teeth lacking accessory ridges and a dorsally curved shaft of the ischium. A histological section of the tibia of the E. orientalis holotype (MSC 7949) suggests that this individual was actively growing at the time of death and, thus, had the potential to become a larger animal later in development. © 2016 Prieto-Márquez et al.","Anatomy; Appalachia; Cretaceous; Dinosaur; Evolution; Hadrosaurid; Histology","Article; body height; dinosaur; Eotrachodon orientalis; fossil animal; frontal bone; fused opitshotic bone; histology; lacrimal apparatus; laterosphenoid bone; maxilla; nasal bone; nonhuman; nose cavity; osteohistology; phylogeny; postorbital; premaxilla; prootic bone; quadrate; Santonian; skull fracture; spine; squamosal; supraoccipital bone; Tethyshadros insularis; vertebra; zygapophyseal joint","Prieto-Márquez, A.; School of Earth Sciences, University of BristolUnited Kingdom; email: redshore@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84965110274

The body mass of the dodo has been particularly contentious, with the flightless pigeon alternatively reconstructed as slim or fat depending upon the skeletal metric used as the basis for mass prediction. Resolving this dichotomy and obtaining a reliable estimate for mass is essential before future analyses regarding dodo life history, physiology or biomechanics can be conducted. Previous mass estimates of the dodo have relied upon predictive equations based upon hind limb dimensions of extant pigeons. Yet the hind limb proportions of dodo have been found to differ considerably from those of their modern relatives, particularly with regards to midshaft diameter. Therefore, application of predictive equations to unusually robust fossil skeletal elements may bias mass estimates.We present a whole-body computed tomography (CT) -based mass estimation technique for application to the dodo.We generate 3D volumetric renders of the articulated skeletons of 20 species of extant pigeons, and wrap minimum-fit 'convex hulls' around their bony extremities. Convex hull volume is subsequently regressed against mass to generate predictive models based upon whole skeletons. Our best-performing predictive model is characterized by high correlation coefficients and low mean squared error (a = -2.31, b = 0.90, r2 = 0.97, MSE = 0.0046).When applied to articulated composite skeletons of the dodo (National Museums Scotland, NMS.Z.1993.13; Natural History Museum, NHMUK A.9040 and S/1988.50.1), we estimate eviscerated body masses of 8-10.8 kg.When accounting for missing soft tissues, this may equate to live masses of 10.6-14.3 kg. Mass predictions presented here overlap at the lower end of those previously published, and support recent suggestions of a relatively slim dodo.

Over 80 tridactyl tracks, confined to the same bedding surface in the Lower Jurassic Elliot Formation at Mafube (eastern Free State, South Africa), show large shape variability over the length of the study site. These morphological differences are considered here to be mainly due to variations in the substrate rheology as opposed to differences in the trackmaker's foot anatomy, foot kinematics or recent weathering of the bedding surface. The sedimentary structures (e.g., desiccation cracks, ripple marks) preserved in association with and within some of the Mafube tracks suggest that the imprints were produced essentially contemporaneous and are true dinosaur tracks rather than undertracks or erosional remnants. They are therefore valuable not only for the interpretation of the ancient environment (i.e., seasonally dry river channels) but also for taxonomic assessments as some of them closely resemble the original anatomy of the trackmaker's foot. The tracks are grouped, based on size, into two morphotypes that can be identified as Eubrontes-like and Grallator-like ichnogenera. The Mafube morphotypes are tentatively attributable to large and small tridactyl theropod trackmakers, possibly to Dracovenator and Coelophysis based on the following criteria: (a) lack of manus impressions indicative of obligate bipeds; (b) long, slender-digits that are asymmetrical and taper; (c) often end in a claw impression or point; and (d) the tracks that are longer than broad.

The importance of resisting torsional loads is best illustrated by the convergence of wing bone structure (e.g., long with thin walls) across extant bats and birds. Whether or not such a convergence occurs at the microstructural level is less clear. In volant birds, the humeri and ulnae often contain abundant laminar bony tissue in which primary circumferential vascular canals course concentrically about the long axis of the bone. These circumferential canals and the matrix surrounding them presumably function to resist the tissue-level shear stress caused by flight-induced torsion. Here, we assess whether or not laminar bone is a general adaptive feature in extant flying vertebrates using a histological analysis of bat bones. We sampled the humeri from six adult taxa representing a broad phylogenetic and body size range (6-1,000 g). Transverse thick sections were prepared from the midshaft of each humerus. Bone tissue was classified based on the predominant orientation of primary vascular canals. Our results show that humeri from bats across a wide phylogenetic and body size range do not contain any laminar bone. Instead, humeri are essentially avascular in bats below about 100 g and are poorly vascularized with occasional longitudinal to slightly radial canals in large bats. In contrast, humeri from birds across a comparable size range (40-1,000 g) are highly vascularized with a wide range in bone laminarity. Phylogenetically-informed scaling analyses reveal that the difference in vascularity between birds and bats is best explained by higher somatic relative growth rates in birds. The presence of wing bone laminarity in birds and its absence in bats suggests that laminar bone is not a necessary biomechanical feature in flying vertebrates and may be apomorphic to birds. © 2015 Lee and Simons.","Avascular bone; Bat; Bird; Bone histology; Cross-sectional geometry; Field metabolic rate; Flight; Growth rate","adult; animal tissue; Article; bat; body mass; body size; bone laminarity; bone length; bone matrix; bone structure; evolutionary adaptation; growth rate; histology; imaging; mechanical torsion; metabolic rate; nonhuman; phylogeny; sampling; shear stress; torsional resistance; vascularization; Aves; Vertebrata","Lee, A.H.; Department of Anatomy, Midwestern UniversityUnited States; email: alee712@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926467560

The Swiss Jura Mountains are a key region for Late Jurassic eucryptodiran turtles. Already in the mid 19th century, the Solothurn Turtle Limestone (Solothurn, NW Switzerland) yielded a great amount of Kimmeridgian turtles that are traditionally referred to Plesiochelyidae, Thalassemydidae, and Eurysternidae. In the past few years, fossils of these coastal marine turtles were also abundantly discovered in the Kimmeridgian of the Porrentruy region (NW Switzerland). These findings include numerous sub-complete shells, out of which we present two new specimens of Thalassemys (Thalassemydidae) in this study. Methods. We compare the new material from Porrentruy to the type species Th. hugii, which is based on a well preserved specimen from the Solothurn Turtle Limestone (Solothurn, Switzerland). In order to improve our understanding of the paleogeographic distribution of Thalassemys, anatomical comparisons are extended to Thalassemys remains from other European countries, notably Germany and England. Results. While one of the two Thalassemys specimens from Porrentruy can be attributed to Th. hugii, the other specimen represents a new species, Th. bruntrutana n. sp.

By reviewing their fossil record, we show that (1) spider crabs first appeared in the Western Atlantic in the Late Cretaceous, (2) they became common since the Miocene, and (3) most species and genera are found in the Caribbean region from the Miocene onwards. Furthermore, taxonomic work on some modern and fossil Mithracidae, a family that might have originated in the Western Atlantic, was conducted. Specifically,Maguimithrax gen. nov. is erected to accommodate the extant species Damithrax spinosissimus, while Damithrax cf. pleuracanthus is recognized for the first time from the fossil record (late Pliocene-early Pleistocene, Florida, USA). Furthermore, two new species are described fromthe lowerMiocene coral-associated limestones of Jamaica (Mithrax arawakum sp. nov. and Nemausa windsorae sp. nov.). Spurred by a recent revision of the subfamily, two known species from the same deposits are refigured and transferred to new genera:Mithrax donovani to Nemausa, and Mithrax unguis to Damithrax. The diverse assemblage of decapods from these coral-associated limestones underlines the importance of reefs for the abundance and diversity of decapods in deep time. Finally, we quantitatively show that these crabs possess allometric growth in that length/width ratios drop as specimens grow, a factor that is not always taken into account while describing and comparing among taxa. © 2015 Klompmaker et al.","Biodiversity; Biogeography; Crustacea; Decapoda; Majoidea; Paleoecology; Paleontology; Reef; Systematics; Taxonomy","limestone; Article; Atlantic Ocean; biodiversity; biogeography; crab; Damithrax; female; fossil; geographic distribution; Maguimithrax; male; nonhuman; paleontology; spider crab; taxonomy","Klompmaker, A.A.; Florida Museum of Natural History, University of FloridaUnited States",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945196291

This fossil record shows a wide diversity in morphology and size, with specimens ranging from putative juveniles to fully-grown individuals. The goal of this study was to reconstruct the ontogenetic changes that occur in the craniofacial skeleton of C. apertus through a quantitative cladistic analysis. Forty-seven cranial specimens were independently coded in separate data matrices for 80 hypothetical multistate growth characters and 130 hypothetical binary growth characters. Both analyses yielded the max-limit of 100,000 most parsimonious saved trees and the strict con-sensus collapsed into large polytomies. In order to reduce conflict resulting from missing data, fragmentary individuals were removed and the analyses were rerun. Among both the complete and the reduced data sets the multistate analyses recov-ered a shorter tree with a higher consistency index (CI) than the additive binary data sets. The arrangement within the trees shows a progression of specimens with a recurved nasal horn in the least mature individuals, followed by specimens with straight nasal horns in relatively more mature individuals, and finally specimens with procurved nasal horns in the most mature individuals. The most mature in-dividuals are further characterized by the reduction of the cranial horn ornamen-tations in late growth stages, a trait that similarly occurs in the growth of other di-nosaurs. Bone textural changes were found to be sufficient proxies for relative ma-turity in individuals that have not reached adult size. Additionally, frill length is congruent with relative maturity status and makes an acceptable proxy for ontoge-netic status, especially in smaller individuals. In adult-sized individuals, the fusion of the epiparietals and episquamosals and the orientation of the nasal horn are the best indicators of relative maturity. This study recovers no clear evidence for sexually specific display structures or size dimorphism in C. apertus.© 2014 Frederickson et al.","Centrosaurus; Ceratopsia; Cladistics; Dinosauria; Fossil; Growth; Ontogeny","animal tissue; article; biparietal distance; bone development; Centrosaurus apertus; cladistics; craniofacial morphology; dinosaur; fossil animal; growth curve; maturity; nonhuman; ontogeny; paleontology; phylogeny; sex difference; taphonomy","Frederickson, J.A.; Temple University, Department of Earth and Environmental Science, Philadelphia, PA, United States; email: Joseph.A.Frederickson-1@ou.edu",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84895738207

Although a number of species from Lower-Middle Triassic deposits worldwide have been referred to the putative clade Euparkeriidae, the monophyly of Euparkeriidae is controversial and has yet to be demonstrated by quantitative phylogenetic analysis. Three Chinese taxa have been recently suggested to be euparkeriids: Halazhaisuchus qiaoensis, 'Turfanosuchus shageduensis', and Wangisuchus tzeyii, all three of which were collected from the Middle Triassic Ermaying Formation of northern China. Here, we reassess the taxonomy and systematics of these taxa.We regardWangisuchus tzeyii as a nomen dubium, because the holotype is undiagnostic and there is no convincing evidence that the previously referred additional specimens represent the same taxon as the holotype. We also regard 'Turfanosuchus shageduensis' as a nomen dubium as we are unable to identify any diagnostic features.We refer the holotype to Archosauriformes, and more tentatively to Euparkeriidae. Halazhaisuchus qiaoensis and the holotype of 'Turfanosuchus shageduensis' are resolved as sister taxa in a phylogenetic analysis, and are in turn the sister taxon to Euparkeria capensis, forming a monophyletic Euparkeriidae that is the sister to Archosauria+Phytosauria. This is the first quantitative phylogenetic analysis to recover a non-monospecific, monophyletic Euparkeriidae, but euparkeriid monophyly is only weakly supported and will require additional examination. Given their similar sizes, stratigraphic positions and phylogenetic placement, the holotype of 'Turfanosuchus shageduensis' may represent a second individual of Halazhaisuchus qiaoensis, but no apomorphies or unique character combination can be identified to unambiguously unite the two.

Since the first discovery of P. engelhardti no juvenile specimens of this species had been described in detail.

Two species, Koskinonodon perfectus and Apachesaurus gregorii, are known from Petrified Forest National Park (PEFO), AZ. Small, elongate intercentra are the single diagnostic postcranial characteristic of the smaller A. gregorii. However, a poor understanding of the earliest life stages of Koskinonodon perfectus and other large metoposaurids makes it unclear whether the proportions of the intercentra are a diagnostic feature for species discrimination or whether they are influenced by ontogeny. Previous work on metoposaurid intercentra has shown that ontogenetic information can be extrapolated from histological analyses. Here, we perform an analysis of the microanatomy and the histology of metoposaurid intercentra from PEFO to determine their ontogenetic maturity and in turn whether elongate intercentra are a reliable taxonomic feature for distinguishing North American metoposaurids. Our findings suggest that the elongate intercentra are the result of ontogenetic variation within a single large-bodied metoposaurid taxon rather than interspecific variation between two metoposaurids of vastly different adult sizes. These findings have significant implications for the taxonomy of North American metoposaurids and subsequently for interpretations of the Chinle Basin paleoenvironment. Furthermore, this study provides the first histological characterization of North American metoposaurid intercentra, thereby improving the understanding of vertebral ontogeny within Metoposauridae and offering new insights into the ecology of large metoposaurids. © 2017 Gee et al.","Intercentra; Metoposaurid; Ontogeny; Paleohistology; Vertebra","adult; Arizona; ecology; forest; histology; human; human tissue; maturity; national park; ontogeny; paleoenvironment; species; taxon; Upper Triassic; vertebra","Gee, B.M.; Department of Biology, University of Toronto MississaugaCanada; email: bryan.gee@mail.utoronto.ca",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017513389

Coupled with its relatively complete nature and the rarity of Oxfordian sauropod remains in general, this is an important specimen for understanding the early evolution of Titanosauriformes. Full preparation and description of this specimen, known from teeth, vertebrae and most of the appendicular skeleton of a single individual, recognises it as a distinct taxon: Vouivria damparisensis gen. et sp. nov. Phylogenetic analysis of a data matrix comprising 77 taxa (including all putative brachiosaurids) scored for 416 characters recovers a fairly well resolved Brachiosauridae. Vouivria is a basal brachiosaurid, confirming its status as the stratigraphically oldest known titanosauriform. Brachiosauridae consists of a paraphyletic array of Late Jurassic forms, with Europasaurus, Vouivria and Brachiosaurus recovered as successively more nested genera that lie outside of a clade comprising (Giraffatitan + Sonorasaurus) + (Lusotitan + (Cedarosaurus + Venenosaurus)). Abydosaurus forms an unresolved polytomy with the latter five taxa. The Early Cretaceous South American sauropod Padillasaurus was previously regarded as a brachiosaurid, but is here placed within Somphospondyli. A recent study contended that a number of characters used in a previous iteration of this data matrix are 'biologically related', and thus should be excluded from phylogenetic analysis. We demonstrate that almost all of these characters show variation between taxa, and implementation of sensitivity analyses, in which these characters are excluded, has no effect on tree topology or resolution. We argue that where there is morphological variation, this should be captured, rather than ignored. Unambiguous brachiosaurid remains are known only from the USA, western Europe and Africa, and the clade spanned the Late Jurassic through to the late Albian/early Cenomanian, with the last known occurrences all from the USA. Regardless of whether their absence from the Cretaceous of Europe, as well as other regions entirely, reflects regional extinctions and genuine absences, or sampling artefacts, brachiosaurids appear to have become globally extinct by the earliest Late Cretaceous. © 2017 Mannion et al.","Biogeography; Brachiosauridae; Character correlation; Cretaceous; France; Gondwana; Late Jurassic; Laurasia; Mesozoic; Ontogeny; Oxfordian; Sacral fusion","Africa; Albian; appendicular skeleton; artifact; biogeography; Cenomanian; cladistics; consensus; dinosaur; France; nonhuman; ontogeny; Oxfordian; phylogeny; sacral spinal cord; sampling; taxon; tooth; vertebra","Mannion, P.D.; Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College LondonUnited Kingdom; email: philipdmannion@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018945842

Salisbury, School of Biological Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia","The abundant dinosaurian tracksites of the Lower Cretaceous (Valanginian-Barremian) Broome Sandstone of the Dampier Peninsula, Western Australia, form an important part of the West Kimberley National Heritage Place. Previous attempts to document these tracksites using traditional mapping techniques (e.g., surface overlays, transects and gridlines combined with conventional photography) have been hindered by the non-trivial challenges associated with working in this area, including, but not limited to: (1) the remoteness of many of the tracksites; (2) the occurrence of the majority of the tracksites in the intertidal zone. (3) the size and complexity of many of the tracksites, with some extending over several square kilometres. Using the historically significant and well-known dinosaurian tracksites at Minyirr (Gantheaume Point), we show how these issues can be overcome through the use of an integrated array of remote sensing tools. A combination of high-resolution aerial photography with both manned and unmanned aircraft, airborne and handheld high-resolution lidar imaging and handheld photography enabled the collection of large amounts of digital data from which 3D models of the tracksites at varying resolutions were constructed. The acquired data encompasses a very broad scale, from the sub-millimetre level that details individual tracks, to the multiple-kilometre level, which encompasses discontinuous tracksite exposures and large swathes of coastline. The former are useful for detailed ichnological work, while the latter are being employed to better understand the stratigraphic and temporal relationship between tracksites in a broader geological and palaeoecological context. These approaches and the data they can generate now provide a means through which digital conservation and temporal monitoring of the Dampier Peninsula's dinosaurian tracksites can occur. As plans for the on-going management of the tracks in this area progress, analysis of the 3D data and 3D visualization will also likely provide an important means through which the broader public can experience these spectacular National Heritage listed landscapes. © 2017 Romilio et al.","3D visualization; Broome sandstone; Dinosaurian tracksites; Lidar; Lower cretaceous; Photogrammetry","aircraft; Barremian; exposure; imaging; inheritance; landscape; model; photogrammetry; remote sensing; Valanginian; Western Australia","Romilio, A.; School of Biological Sciences, The University of QueenslandAustralia; email: a.romilo@uq.edu.au",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015859825

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) studies are presently generating huge volumes of data to address this biogeographical topic. However, these studies are often focused on specific environment types or processes leading to the production of individual, unconnected datasets. The large amounts of legacy sequence data with associated metadata that exist can be harnessed to better place the genetic information found in these surveys into a wider environmental context. Here we introduce a software program, seqenv, to carry out precisely such a task. It automatically performs similarity searches of short sequences against the ``nt'' nucleotide database provided by NCBI and, out of every hit, extracts-if it is available-the textual metadata field. After collecting all the isolation sources from all the search results, we run a text mining algorithm to identify and parse words that are associated with the Environmental Ontology (EnvO) controlled vocabulary. This, in turn, enables us to determine both in which environments individual sequences or taxa have previously been observed and, by weighted summation of those results, to summarize complete samples. We present two demonstrative applications of seqenv to a survey of ammonia oxidizing archaea as well as to a plankton paleome dataset from the Black Sea. These demonstrate the ability of the tool to reveal novel patterns in HTS and its utility in the fields of environmental source tracking, paleontology, and studies of microbial biogeography.

One extant monotypic lineage, Platanista gangetica (the Ganges and Indus river dolphin), is the sole surviving member of the broader group Platanistoidea, with many fossil relatives that range from Oligocene to Miocene in age. Curiously, the highly threatened Platanista is restricted today to freshwater river systems of South Asia, yet nearly all fossil platanistoids are known globally from marine rocks, suggesting a marine ancestry for this group. In recent years, studies on the phylogenetic relationships in Platanistoidea have reached a general consensus about the membership of different sub-clades and putative extinct groups, although the position of some platanistoid groups (e.g., Waipatiidae) has been contested. Here we describe a new genus and species of fossil platanistoid, Arktocara yakataga, gen. et sp. nov. from the Oligocene of Alaska, USA. The type and only known specimen was collected from the marine Poul Creek Formation, a unit known to include Oligocene strata, exposed in the Yakutat City and Borough of Southeast Alaska. In our phylogenetic analysis of stem and nodebased Platanistoidea, Arktocara falls within the node-based sub-clade Allodelphinidae as the sister taxon to Allodelphis pratti. With a geochronologic age between ~29-24 million years old, Arktocara is among the oldest crown Odontoceti, reinforcing the long-standing view that the diversification for crown lineages must have occurred no later than the early Oligocene. © 2016 Boersma and Pyenson.","Cetacea; Evolution; Fossil record; Neogene; Oligocene; Pan-Platanista; Platanistoidea; River dolphins","Alaska; Antiquity; cladistics; consensus development; dolphin; exposure; fossil; human; human tissue; Neogene; new genus; nonhuman; river; Rupelian; sister group","Boersma, A.T.; Department of Paleobiology, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian InstitutionUnited States; email: boersma.alex@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992123350

Dermal bones show a diploï¿½ structure, with an ornamented external surface. The ridges consist of mostly well vascularized parallelfibered bone; the valleys are built of an avascular layer of lamellar bone. The thick middle region consists of cancellous bone, with varying porosity. The thin and less vascularized internal cortex consists of parallel-fibered bone. The numerous Sharpey's fibers and ISF are present in all bones. The cyclicity of growth is manifested as an alternation of thick, avascular annuli and high vascularized zones as well as a sequence of resting lines. The detailed histological framework of dermal bones varies even within a single bone; this seems to be related to the local biomechanical loading of the particular part of the skull. The dynamic processes observed during the ornamentation creation indicate that the positions of the ridges and grooves change during growth and could be a specific adaptation to changing biomechanical conditions and stress distribution during bone development. In the supratemporal, the cementing lines show that the remodeling process could be involved in the creations of sculpture. The common occurrence of ISF suggests that metaplastic ossification plays an important role during cranial development. Endochondral bones preserved the numerous remains of calcified cartilage. This indicates that ossification follows a pattern known for stereospondyl intercentra, with relatively slow ossification of the trabecular part and late development of the periosteal cortex. The large accumulation of Sharpey's fibers in the occipital condyles indicates the presence of strong muscles and ligaments connecting the skull to the vertebral column.

It is therefore important to understand the factors which may affect its evolution, and diet has attracted much interest in this context. A recent study which examined the evolution of the earliest terrestrial herbivores in the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian concluded that in the four herbivorous clades examined there was a trend towards increased body size, and that this increase was more substantial than that observed in closely related carnivorous clades. However, this hypothesis was not based on quantitative examination, and phylogenetic comparative methods provide a more robust means of testing such hypotheses. Here, the evolution of body size within different dietary regimes is examined in Captorhinidae, the most diverse and longest lived of these earliest high fibre herbivores. Evolutionary models were fit to their phylogeny to test for variation in rate and mode of evolution between the carnivorous and herbivorous members of this clade, and an analysis of rate variation throughout the tree was carried out. Estimates of ancestral body sizes were calculated in order to compare the rates and direction of evolution of lineages with different dietary regimes. Support for the idea that the high fibre herbivores within captorhinids are being drawn to a higher adaptive peak in body size than the carnivorous members of this clade is weak. A shift in rates of body size evolution is identified, but this does not coincide with the evolution of high-fibre herbivory, instead occurring earlier in time and at a more basal node. Herbivorous lineages which show an increase in size are not found to evolve at a faster rate than those which show a decrease; in fact, it is those which experience a size decrease which evolve at higher rates. It is possible the shift in rates of evolution is related to the improved food processing ability of the more derived captorhinids rather than a shift in diet, but the evidence for this is circumstantial. © 2016 Brocklehurst.","Body size; Captorhinidae; Diet; Evolution; Herbivore; Rate","Article; body size; Captorhinidae; carnivore; dietary intake; environmental change; evolutionary rate; feeding behavior; food processing; herbivore; heritability; model; morphology; nonhuman; phylogeny; plesiomorphy","Brocklehurst, N.; Leibniz-Institut für Evolutions- und Biodiversitätsforschung, Museum für NaturkundeGermany; email: neil.brocklehurst@mfn-berlin.de",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961763334

The oldest-known hyaenodont fossils are from the middle Paleocene of North Africa and the antiquity of the group in Afro-Arabia led to the hypothesis that it originated there and dispersed to Asia, Europe, and North America. Here we describe two new hyaenodont species based on the oldest hyaenodont cranial specimens known from Afro-Arabia. The material was collected from the latest Eocene Locality 41 (L-41, ~34 Ma) in the Fayum Depression, Egypt. Akhnatenavus nefertiticyon sp. nov. has specialized, hypercarnivorous molars and an elongate cranial vault. In A. nefertiticyon the tallest, piercing cusp on M1-M2 is the paracone. Brychotherium ephalmos gen. et sp. nov. has more generalized molars that retain the metacone and complex talonids. In B. ephalmos the tallest, piercing cusp on M1-M2 is the metacone. We incorporate this new material into a series of phylogenetic analyses using a character-taxon matrix that includes novel dental, cranial, and postcranial characters, and samples extensively from the global record of the group. The phylogenetic analysis includes the first application of Bayesian methods to hyaenodont relationships. B. ephalmos is consistently placed within Teratodontinae, an Afro-Arabian clade with several generalist and hypercarnivorous forms, and Akhnatenavus is consistently recovered in Hyainailourinae as part of an Afro-Arabian radiation. The phylogenetic results suggest that hypercarnivory evolved independently three times within Hyaenodonta: in Teratodontinae, in Hyainailourinae, and in Hyaenodontinae. Teratodontines are consistently placed in a close relationship with Hyainailouridae (Hyainailourinae + Apterodontinae) to the exclusion of ""proviverrines,"" hyaenodontines, and several North American clades, and we propose that the superfamily Hyainailouroidea be used to describe this relationship. Using the topologies recovered from each phylogenetic method, we reconstructed the biogeographic history of Hyaenodonta using parsimony optimization (PO), likelihood optimization (LO), and Bayesian Binary Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to examine support for the Afro-Arabian origin of Hyaenodonta. Across all analyses, we found that Hyaenodonta most likely originated in Europe, rather than Afro-Arabia. The clade is estimated by tip-dating analysis to have undergone a rapid radiation in the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene; a radiation currently not documented by fossil evidence. During the Paleocene, lineages are reconstructed as dispersing to Asia, Afro-Arabia, and North America. The place of origin of Hyainailouroidea is likely Afro-Arabia according to the Bayesian topologies but it is ambiguous using parsimony. All topologies support the constituent clades-Hyainailourinae, Apterodontinae, and Teratodontinae-as Afro-Arabian and tip-dating estimates that each clade is established in Afro-Arabia by the middle Eocene.

Bothremydidae is a clade of extinct pleurodiran turtles known from the Cretaceous to Paleogene of Africa, Europe, India, Madagascar, and North and South America. The group is most diverse during the Late Cretaceous to Paleogene of Africa. Little is known, however, about the early evolution of the group. Methods. We here figure and describe a fossil turtle from early Late Cretaceous deposits exposed at MacFarlane Mine in Cedar Canyon, southwestern Utah, USA. The sediments associated with the new turtle are utilized to infer its stratigraphic provenience and the depositional settings in which it was deposited. The fossil is compared to previously described fossil pleurodires, integrated into a modified phylogenetic analysis of pelomedusoid turtles, and the biogeography of bothremydid turtles is reassessed. In light of the novel phylogenetic hypotheses, six previously established taxon names are converted to phylogenetically defined clade names to aid communication. Results. The new fossil turtle can be inferred with confidence to have originated from a brackish water facies within the late Cenomanian Culver Coal Zone of the Naturita Formation. The fossil can be distinguished from all other previously described pleurodires and is therefore designated as a new taxon, Paiutemys tibert gen. et. sp. nov. Phylogenetic analysis places the new taxon as sister to the European Polysternon provinciale, Foxemys trabanti and Foxemys mechinorum at the base of Bothremydinae. Biogeographic analysis suggests that bothremydids originated as continental turtles in Gondwana, but that bothremydines adapted to near-shore marine conditions and therefore should be seen as having a circum-Atlantic distribution. ï¿½ 2016 Joyce et al.","Bothremydidae; Cenomanian; Late cretaceous; Naturita formation; Paiutemys tibert; Paleobiogeography; Pleurodira; Testudines; Utah","Article; biogeography; Cenomanian; fossil; Foxemys mechinorum; Foxemys trabanti; nonhuman; North America; phylogeny; Polysternon provinciale; turtle","Joyce, W.G.; Departement fï¿½r Geowissenschaften, Universitï¿½t FreiburgSwitzerland; email: walter.g.joyce@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991384667

Although various protocols exist for bone protein recovery, little is known about how discrete steps in each protocol affect the subset of the bone proteome recovered by mass spectrometry (MS) analyses. Characterizing these different ``extractomes'' will provide critical data for development of novel and more efficient protein extraction methodologies for fossils. Here, we analyze 22 unique sub-extractions of chicken bone and directly compare individual extraction components for their total protein yield and diversity and coverage of bone proteins identified by MS. We extracted proteins using different combinations and ratios of demineralizing reagents, protein-solubilizing reagents, and post-extraction buffer removal methods, then evaluated tryptic digests from 20 mg aliquots of each fraction by tandem MS/MS on a 12T FT-ICR mass spectrometer. We compared total numbers of peptide spectral matches, peptides, and proteins identified from each fraction, the redundancy of protein identifications between discrete steps of extraction methods, and the sequence coverage obtained for select, abundant proteins. Although both alpha chains of collagen I (the most abundant protein in bone) were found in all fractions, other collagenous and non-collagenous proteins (e.g., apolipoprotein, osteonectin, hemoglobin) were differentially identified. Wefound that when a standardized amount of extracted proteins was analyzed, extraction steps that yielded the most protein (by weight) from bone were often not the ones that produced the greatest diversity of bone proteins, or the highest degree of protein coverage. Generally, the highest degrees of diversity and coverage were obtained from demineralization fractions, and the proteins found in the subsequent solubilization fractions were highly redundant with those in the previous fraction. Based on these data, we identify future directions and parameters to consider (e.g., proteins targeted, amount of sample required) when applying discrete parts of these protocols to fossils.","Bone matrix proteins; Bone protein extraction protocols; Mass spectrometry; Methods comparison; Paleoproteomics; Proteomics","animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; bone demineralization; bone matrix; bone protein extraction; dialysis; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; extraction; Gallus gallus; histology; mass spectrometry; nonhuman; paleoproteomics; protein analysis; protein determination; proteomics","Schroeter, E.R.; Department of Biological Sciences, North Carolina State UniversityUnited States; email: easchroe@ncsu.edu",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994460169

Taking into account the clutch composition and geometry, the nature and properties of the sediments, the eggshells' structures and conductance, it would appear that titanosaurs adopted nesting behaviors comparable to the modern Australasian megapodes, using burrow-nesting in diverse media and mound-building strategies. © 2015 Hechenleitner et al.","Egg physiology; Incubation with environmental heat; Labile nesting behavior; Nesting environment; Nesting site; Titanosaur","animal behavior; Article; dinosaur; evaluation study; evolutionary adaptation; hydrothermal vent species; morphology; nonhuman; phylogeny","Martín Hechenleitner, E.; Department of Geosciences, Centro Regional de Investigaciones Científicas y Transferencia Tecnológica de La Rioja, CRILAR-CONICETArgentina; email: emhechenleitner@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946218251

One of the most striking atypical features is the rete mirabile epidurale: a subdural arterial meshwork that functionally and anatomically replaces the arteria carotis interna. This meshwork facilitates an exceptional ability to cool the brain, and was thought to be present in all artiodactyls. Recent research, however, has found that species of mouse deer (Artiodactyla: Tragulidae) endemic to the Malay Archipelago possess a complete a. carotis interna instead of a rete mirabile epidurale. As tragulids are the sister group to pecoran ruminants, the lack of a rete mirabile epidurale in these species raises intriguing evolutionary questions about the origin and nature of artiodactyl thermoregulatory cranial vasculature. In this study, cranial arterial patterns are documented for the remaining species within the Tragulidae. Radiopaque latex vascular injection, computed tomography (CT-scanning), and digital 3-dimensional anatomical reconstruction are used to image the cranial arteries of a Sri Lankan spotted chevrotain, Moschiola meminna. Sites of hard and soft tissue interaction were identified, and these osteological correlates were then sought in nine skulls representative of the remaining tragulid species. Both hard and soft tissue surveys confirm that the presence of an a. carotis interna is the common condition for tragulids.Moreover, the use of a 3-D, radiographic anatomical imaging technique enabled identification of a carotico-maxillary anastomosis that may have implications for the evolution of the artiodactyl rete mirabile epidurale. © 2015 O'Brien.","Anatomical imaging; Artiodactyla; Carotid rete; Cranial vasculature; Evolution; Ruminant; Tragulidae","anastomosis; artery; computer assisted tomography; imaging; injection; maxilla; osteology; ruminant; sister group; soft tissue; species; tissue interaction; vascularization","O'Brien, H.D.; Departement of Biological Sciences, Ohio UniversityUnited States; email: haley.obrien@okstate.edu",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84950976555

In Europe only a few cranial remains have been recovered that include the braincase. Arenysaurus is the first European endocast for which the paleoneuroanatomy has been studied. The resulting data have enabled us to draw ontogenetic, phylogenetic and functional inferences. Arenysaurus preserves the endocast and the inner ear. This cranial material was CT scanned, and a 3D-model was generated. The endocast morphology supports a general pattern for hadrosaurids with some characters that distinguish it to a subfamily level, such as a brain cavity that is anteroposteriorly shorter or the angle of the major axis of the cerebral hemisphere to the horizontal in lambeosaurines. Both these characters are present in the endocast of Arenysaurus. Osteological features indicate an adult ontogenetic stage, while some paleoneuroanatomical features are indicative of a subadult ontogenetic stage. It is hypothesized that the presence of puzzling mixture of characters that suggest different ontogenetic stages for this specimen may reflect some degree of dwarfism in Arenysaurus. Regarding the inner ear, its structure shows differences fromthe ornithopod clade with respect to the height of the semicircular canals. These differences could lead to a decrease in the compensatory movements of eyes and head, with important implications for the paleobiology and behavior of hadrosaurid taxa such as Edmontosaurus, Parasaurolophus and Arenysaurus. The endocranial morphology of European hadrosaurids sheds new light on the evolution of this group and may reflect the conditions in the archipelago where these animals lived during the Late Cretaceous. © 2015 Cruzado-Caballero et al.","Dinosauria; European lambeosaurine; Hadrosaurid; Inner ear; Paleobiology; Paleoneurology","Arenysaurus ardevoli; Article; brain region; computer assisted tomography; cranial nerve; dinosaur; dura mater; endocast; fossil; hemisphere; inner ear; medulla oblongata; morphology; neuroanatomy; nonhuman; olfactory bulb; paleontology; sella turcica; skull; three dimensional imaging; transverse sinus; Animalia; Dinosauria; Hadrosauridae; Ornithopoda","Cruzado-Caballero, P.; CONICET-Instituto de Investigación en Paleobiología y Geología, Universidad Nacional de Río NegroArgentina",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926428606

These advances motivated the recent completion of extensive preparation and conservation work on the holotype and only known specimen of Dakotadon lakotaensis, a basal ankylopollexian fromthe Lakota Formation of South Dakota. That specimen (SDSM 8656) preserves a partial skull, lower jaws, a single dorsal vertebra, and two caudal vertebrae. That new preparation work exposed several bones not included in the original description and revealed that other bones were previously misidentified. The presence of extensive deformation in areas of the skull is also noted that influenced inaccuracies in prior descriptions and reconstructions of this taxon. In addition to providing an extensive re-description of D. lakotaensis, this study reviews previously proposed diagnoses for this taxon, identifies two autapomorphies, and provides an extensive differential diagnosis. Dakotadon lakotaensis is distinct from the only other ankylopollexian taxon known from the Lakota Formation, Osmakasaurus depressus, in the presence of two prominent, anteroposteriorly oriented ridges on the ventral surfaces of the caudal vertebrae, the only overlapping material preserved between these taxa. The systematic relationships of D. lakotaensis are evaluated using both the parsimony and posterior probability optimality criteria, with both sets of analyses recovering D. lakotaensis as a non-hadrosauriform ankylopollexian that is more closely related to taxa from the Early Cretaceous (e.g., Iguanacolossus, Hippodraco, and Theiophytalia) than to more basally situated taxa from the Jurassic (e.g., Camptosaurus, Uteodon). This taxonomic work is supplemented by field work that relocated the type locality, confirming its provenance fromunit L2 (lower Fuson Member equivalent) of the Lakota Formation. Those data, combined with recently revised ages for the members of the Lakota Formation based on charophyte and ostracod biostratigraphy, constrain the age of this taxon to the late Valanginian to early Barremian. © 2015 Boyd and Pagnac.","Ankylopollexia; Bayesian; Dakotadon; Early Cretaceous; Lakota Formation; Ornithischia; South Dakota; Systematics","age; anatomical concepts; Article; biostratigraphy; cladistics; Dakotadon lakotaensis; dentition; dinosaur; field work; geographic distribution; Jurassic; Lower Cretaceous; mandible; maxilla; nonhuman; paleontology; parsimony analysis; phylogeny; skull; vertebra","Boyd, C.A.; North Dakota Geological SurveyUnited States",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944884726

Due to incompleteness and the potential for restricted sample sizes in the fossil record, palaeobiological analyses of allometry may encounter higher rates of error. Differences in sample size between fossil and extant studies and any resulting effects on allometric analyses have not been thoroughly investigated, and a logical lower threshold to sample size is not clear. Here we show that studies based on fossil datasets have smaller sample sizes than those based on extant taxa. A similar pattern between vertebrates and invertebrates indicates this is not a problemunique to either group, but common to both. We investigate the relationship between sample size, ontogenetic allometric relationship and statistical power using an empirical dataset of skull measurements of modern Alligator mississippiensis. Across a variety of subsampling techniques, used to simulate different taphonomic and/or sampling effects, smaller sample sizes gave less reliable and more variable results, often with the result that allometric relationships will go undetected due to Type II error (failure to reject the null hypothesis). This may result in a false impression of fewer instances of positive/negative allometric growth in fossils compared to living organisms. These limitations are not restricted to fossil data and are equally applicable to allometric analyses of rare extant taxa. No mathematically derived minimum sample size for ontogenetic allometric studies is found; rather results of isometry (but not necessarily allometry) should not be viewed with confidence at small sample sizes. © 2015 Brown and Vavrek.","Alligator; Error; Fossil; Growth; Isometry; Morphometrics; Palaeontology; Sample size; Shape; Size","Alligator mississippiensis; allometry; Article; cranial measurement; data analysis; evolution; extant species; extinct species; fossil; information retrieval; measurement error; morphometrics; nonhuman; ontogeny; osteology; paleontology; regression analysis; sampling; sampling error; skull; Alligator; Alligator mississippiensis; Invertebrata; Vertebrata","Brown, C.M.; Royal Tyrrell Museum of PalaeontologyCanada",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926435658

Unfortunately, most palaeopathological studies are confined to external morphological interpretations due to the destructive nature of traditional methods of study. This limits the degree of reliable diagnosis and interpretation possible. X-ray MicroTomography (micro-CT, XMT) provides a non-destructive means of analysing the internal three-dimensional structure of pathologies in both extant and extinct individuals, at higher resolutions than possible with medical scanners. In this study, we present external and internal descriptions of pathologies in extant and extinct archosaurs using XMT. This work demonstrates that the combination of external/internal diagnosis that X-ray microtomography facilitates is crucial when differentiating between pathological conditions. Furthermore, we show that the use of comparative species, both through direct analysis and fromthe literature, provides key information for diagnosing between vertebrate groups in the typical pathological conditions and physiological processes. Micro-CT imaging, combined with comparative observations of extant species, provides more detailed and reliable interpretation of palaeopathologies.

In fact, M. emys repetitively tried to reach submerged food items in water, but always failed to grasp them-no suction feeding mechanism was applied. When feeding on land, M. emys showed another peculiar behaviour; it grasped food items by its jaws-a behaviour typical for aquatic or semiaquatic turtles-and not by the tongue as generally accepted as the typical feeding mode in all tortoises studied so far. In M. emys, the hyolingual complex remained retracted during all food uptake sequences, but the food transport was entirely lingual based. The kinematical profiles significantly differed from those described for other tortoises and from those proposed from the general models on the function of the feeding systems in lower tetrapods. We conclude that the feeding behaviour of M. emys might reflect a remnant of the primordial condition expected in the aquatic ancestor of the tortoises. © 2015 Natchev et al.","Evolution; Feeding kinematics; Food uptake; Tetrapoda; Transition to land; Turtle","Article; correlation analysis; eardrum; evolution; feeding apparatus; feeding behavior; lifestyle modification; nonhuman; scoring system; sun exposure; terrestrial species; turtle; Manouria; Manouria emys; Testudines; Testudinidae; Tetrapoda","Natchev, N.; Department of Integrative Zoology, Vienna UniversityAustria; email: nikolay.natchev@univie.ac.at",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940391196

This taxon is of evolutionary importance, as it is the oldest and most basal known macrophagous metriorhynchid. It has a mosaic of plesiomorphic and derived feeding related characteristics, including: teeth with microscopic, poorly formed and non-contiguous denticles; increased tooth apicobasal length; ventrally displaced dentary tooth row (increased gape); reduced dentary tooth count; and a proportionally long mandibular symphysis. However the type specimen, and current referred specimens, all lack a preserved cranium. As such, the craniofacial morphology of this taxon, and its potential feeding ecology, remains poorly understood. Here we describe two skulls and two lower jaws which we refer to T. lythrodectikos. Previously these specimens were referred to 'Metriorhynchus' brachyrhynchus. They share with the T. lythrodectikos holotype: the in-line reception pits on the dentary, dorsal margin of the surangular is strongly concave in lateral view, and the most of the angular ventral margin is strongly convex. Based on our description of these specimens, the skull of T. lythrodectikos has three autapomorphies: very long posterior processes of the premaxilla terminating in line with the 4th or 5th maxillary alveoli, deep lateral notches on the lateral surface of the maxillary with reception pits for dentary teeth, and the premaxilla forms the anterior margin of the first maxillary alveoli. Our description of the cranial anatomy of Tyrannoneustes lythrodectikos confirms that some macrophagous characteristics evolved during theMiddle Jurassic, and were not exclusive to the clade Geosaurini. Moreover, the skulls further highlight the mosaic nature of Tyrannoneustes lythrodectikos and wide-gape macrophagous evolution in Geosaurinae. © 2014 Foffa and Young.","Marcrophagy; Metriorhynchidae; Middle jurassic; Skull; Tyrannoneustes","angular gyrus; Article; body height; dentition; frontal bone; mandible; mandibular nerve; maxilla; maxilla osteotomy; nonhuman; osteology; paleontology; reptile; skull development; soft palate; temporal bone; tooth development; tooth socket; Tyrannoneustes lythrodectikos; Crocodylomorpha; Metriorhynchidae","Foffa, D.; School of GeoSciences, Grant Institute, University of EdinburghUnited Kingdom",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907687078

However, such interpretations may be biased by taphonomic processes such as fluvial sorting influenced by tooth shape: shed teeth, removed from the skull during life, and teeth possessing roots, removed from the skull after death. As such, teeth may behave differently in fluvial systems due to their differences in shape. In order to determine the influence of fluvial processes on the preservation and distribution of shed and root-bearing dinosaur teeth, the hydrodynamic behaviors of high-density urethane resin casts of shed and root-bearing Allosaurus and Camarasaurus teeth were experimentally tested for relative transport distances at increasing flow velocities in an artificial fluviatile environment. Results show that tooth cast specimens exhibited comparable patterns of transport at lower velocities, though the shed Camarasaurus teeth transported considerably farther in medium to higher flow velocities. Two-Way ANOVA tests indicate significant differences in the mean transport distances of tooth casts oriented perpendicular to flow (p < 0.05) with varying tooth morphologies and flow velocities. The differences exhibited in the transportability of shed and root-bearing teeth has important implications for taphonomic reconstructions, as well as future studies on dinosaur population dynamics, paleoecology, and feeding behaviors. © 2014 Peterson et al.","Dinosaur; Fluvial transport; Taphonomy; Teeth","article; dinosaur; experimental study; fluvial transport potential; geographic and geological phenomena; hydrodynamics based transfection; morphology; nonhuman; paleoecology; quantitative analysis; shed dinosaur teeth; skull; taphonomy; tooth","Peterson, J.E.; Department of Geology, University ofWisconsin-Oshkosh, Oshkosh, WI, United States; email: petersoj@uwosh.edu",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899095313

Relatively little is known of their endocranial anatomy or its relevance for the evolution of sensory systems, physiology, and other aspects of biology. Nevertheless, such data have significance for two reasons: (1) thalattosuchians represent an important data point regarding adaptation to marine life in tetrapods; and (2) as early-diverging members of the crocodylian stem-lineage, thalattosuchians provide information on the evolutionary assembly of the brain and other endocranial structures in crocodylomorphs. Here we use mCT data to virtually reconstruct the endocranial anatomy of Pelagosaurus typus, an early thalattosuchian with plesiomorphic traits of relevance to the split between the two major subgroups: Teleosauroidea and Metriorhynchoidea. Interpretation of these data in a broad comparative context indicate that several key endocranial features may be unique to thalattosuchians, including: a pyramidal morphology of the semicircular canals, the presence of an elongate endosseous cochlear duct that may indicate enhanced hearing ability, the presence of large, paired canals extending anteriorly from an enlarged pituitary fossa, a relatively straight brain (possibly due to the presence of large, laterally placed orbits), and an enlarged venous sinus projecting dorsally from the endocast that is confluent with the paratympanic sinus system. Notably, we document a large expansion of the nasal cavity anterior to the orbits in Pelagosaurus as an osteological correlate of an enlarged salt gland previously only documented in Late Jurassic metriorhynchoids. This is the first anatomical evidence of this structure in early thalattosuchians. Pelagosaurus also shares the presence of paired olfactory bulbs with metriorhynchoids, and shows an enlarged cerebrum, which may also be present in teleosauroids. Taken together, our findings indicate that physiological and sensory adaptations to marine life occurred early in thalattosuchian evolution, predating the origins of flippers, tail flukes, and hydrodynamic body forms seen later in metriorhynchoids.  © 2017 Pierce et al.","Archosauria; Crocodylomorpha; Endocast; Gharial; Labyrinth; Marine; Sensory adaptation; Thalattosuchia; Three-dimensional","anatomy; archosaur; body build; cochlea duct; hearing; hydrodynamics; Lower Jurassic; morphology; nonhuman; nose cavity; olfactory bulb; orbit; salt gland; sella turcica; semicircular canal; sinus venosus; trematode; Upper Jurassic","Pierce, S.E.; Museum of Comparative Zoology and Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard UniversityUnited States; email: spierce@oeb.harvard.edu",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018601933

Anhanguerids comprise an important clade of pterosaurs, mostly known from dozens of three-dimensionally preserved specimens recovered from the Lower Cretaceous Romualdo Formation (northeastern Brazil). They are remarkably diverse in this sedimentary unit, with eight named species, six of them belonging to the genus Anhanguera. However, such diversity is likely overestimated, as these species have been historically diagnosed based on subtle differences, mainly based on the shape and position of the cranial crest. In spite of that, recently discovered pterosaur taxa represented by large numbers of individuals, including juveniles and adults, as well as presumed males and females, have crests of sizes and shapes that are either ontogenetically variable or sexually dimorphic. Methods.Wedescribe in detail the skull of one of the most complete specimens referred to Anhanguera, AMNH 22555, and use it as a case study to review the diversity of anhanguerids from the Romualdo Formation. In order to accomplish that, a geometric morphometric analysis was performed to assess size-dependent characters with respect to the premaxillary crest in the 12 most complete skulls bearing crests that are referred in, or related to, this clade, almost all of them analyzed first hand. Results. Geometric morphometric regression of shape on centroid size was highly statistically significant (p = 0:0091) and showed that allometry accounts for 25.7% of total shape variation between skulls of different centroid sizes. Premaxillary crests are both taller and anteroposteriorly longer in larger skulls, a feature consistent with ontogenetic growth. A new diagnosis is proposed for Anhanguera, including traits that are nowadays known to be widespread within the genus, as well as ontogenetic changes. AMNH 22555 cannot be referred to ""Anhanguera santanae"" and, in fact, ""Anhanguera santanae"", ""Anhanguera araripensis"", and ""Anhanguera robustus"" are here considered nomina dubia. Discussion. Historically, minor differences in crest morphology have been used in the definition of new anhanguerid species. Nowadays, this practice resulted in a considerable difficulty in referring well-preserved skulls into known taxa. When several specimens are analyzed, morphologies previously believed to be disparate are, in fact, separated by a continuum, and are thus better explained as individual or temporal variations. Stratigraphically controlled excavations on the Romualdo Formation have showed evidence for faunal turnover regarding fish communities. It is thus possible that some of the pterosaurs from this unit were not coeval, and might even represent anagenetic morphotypes. Unfortunately, amateur collecting of Romualdo Formation fossils, aimed especially at commerce, resulted in the lack of stratigraphic data of virtually all its pterosaurs and precludes testing of these further hypotheses. © 2017 Pinheiro and Rodrigues.","Allometry; Anhangueridae; Cretaceous; Geometric morphometrics; Pterosauria; Romualdo formation","adolescent; adult; allometry; cladistics; Cretaceous; diagnosis; fossil; genus; human; human tissue; juvenile; morphology; morphometry; morphotype; nonhuman; skull; turnover time","Pinheiro, F.L.; Laboratório de Paleobiologia, Universidade Federal do PampaBrazil; email: felipepinheiro@unipampa.edu.br",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018244631

The fossil has been interpreted as the remains of one of the earliest flying insects. The specimen mainly preserves the remains of the head. The structures of the mandibles have been used as a main argument for an interpretation as an insect, but these are in fact less easy to interpret. New observed structures include the remains of a head capsule and an additional pair of mouth parts. Structures formerly suggested to represent remains of the head capsule or apodemes are more likely to be representing glands of ectodermal origin. The newly observed structures do not support an interpretation as an insect. Instead they make the interpretation as a myriapod more likely, possibly as a centipede. Centipede remains from the Rhynie Chert are known from scutigeromorphs.

Later, Plisnier-Ladame & Quinet (1969) added a neurocranium and other skeletal remains from the same area to this species. Recently, the neurocranium was re-assigned to the genus Eubalaena thanks to newer phylogenetic analyses. Here, a new description is provided of materials previously assigned to ""Balaena"" belgica together with taxonomic revisions. Our work suggests that the cervical complex originally designated as the type of ""Balaena"" belgica is too poorly preserved to be used as such and is assigned to Balaenidae gen. et sp. indet., thus making ""Balaena"" belgica a nomen dubium. In addition to the neurocranium, the other remains consist in a fragment of maxilla assigned to Balaenidae gen. et sp. indet. and in a humerus assigned to Eubalaena sp. Discovered in the Kruisschans Sands Member of the Lillo Formation (3.2-2.8 Ma, Piacenzian, Late Pliocene), the neurocranium is designated as the holotype of the new species Eubalaena ianitrix. Our phylogenetic analysis supports a sister-group relationship of Eubalaena ianitrix and Eubalaena glacialis, and helps constraining the ages of origin for balaenid clades.

However, recently it has instead been referred to as another clade, the eldonids, which includes the enigmatic Eldonia Walcott, 1911 that was originally described from the Cambrian Burgess Shale. The status of various Proterozoic and Phanerozoic taxa previously referred to porpitids and eldonids is also briefly considered. To help ascertain that the specimens were not dubio- or pseudofossils, elemental mapping using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was conducted. This, in conjunction with the morphology of the specimens, indicated that the fossils were not hematite, iron sulfide, pyrolusite, or other abiologic mineral precipitates. Instead, their status as biologic structures and thus actual fossils is supported.

Here we present a new approach that combines two separate biomechanical techniques (multibody dynamic analysis and skeletal stress analysis) to demonstrate that true running gaits would probably lead to unacceptably high skeletal loads in T. rex. Combining these two approaches reduces the high-level of uncertainty in previous predictions associated with unknown soft tissue parameters in dinosaurs, and demonstrates that the relatively long limb segments of T. rex-long argued to indicate competent running ability-would actually have mechanically limited this species to walking gaits. Being limited to walking speeds contradicts arguments of high-speed pursuit predation for the largest bipedal dinosaurs like T. rex, and demonstrates the power of multiphysics approaches for locomotor reconstructions of extinct animals. © 2017 Sellers et al.","Biomechanics; Computer simulation; Dinosaur; Locomotion; MBDA","biomechanics; computer simulation; dinosaur; limb; nonhuman; predation; prediction; running; soft tissue; species; stress; uncertainty; walking speed","Sellers, W.I.; School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of ManchesterUnited Kingdom; email: William.Sellers@manchester.ac.uk",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024378322

Here, we studied the pattern of morphological variation in the skull of long-nosed armadillos species, with a focus on the systematics of the widely distributed nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus). Methods: We present the first exhaustive 3D comparison of the skull morphology within the genus Dasypus, based on micro-computed tomography. We used geometric morphometric approaches to explore the patterns of the intra- and interspecific morphological variation of the skull with regard to several factors such as taxonomy, geography, allometry, and sexual dimorphism. Results: We show that the shape and size of the skull vary greatly among Dasypus species, with Dasypus pilosus representing a clear outlier compared to other longnosed armadillos. The study of the cranial intraspecific variation in Dasypus novemcinctus evidences clear links to the geographic distribution and argues in favor of a revision of past taxonomic delimitations. Our detailed morphometric comparisons detected previously overlooked morphotypes of nine-banded armadillos, especially a very distinctive unit restricted to the Guiana Shield. Discussion: As our results are congruent with recent molecular data and analyses of the structure of paranasal sinuses, we propose that Dasypus novemcinctus should be regarded either as a polytypic species (with three to four subspecies) or as a complex of several distinct species. © 2017 Hautier et al.","Anatomy; Cingulata; Dasypus; Geometric morphometrics; Skull; Species complex","allometry; anatomy; armadillo; genus; geographic distribution; intraspecific variation; micro-computed tomography; morphology; morphometry; morphotype; nonhuman; paranasal sinus; sex difference; skull; species; subspecies","Hautier, L.; Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution, UMR5554, CNRS, IRD, EPHE, Université de MontpellierFrance; email: lionel.hautier@umontpellier.fr",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027515793

With their Pan-American distribution, long-nosed armadillos (genus Dasypus) constitute an understudied model for Neotropical biogeography. This genus currently comprises seven recognized species, the nine-banded armadillo (D. novemcinctus) having the widest distribution ranging from Northern Argentina to the South-Eastern US. With their broad diversity of habitats, nine-banded armadillos provide a useful model to explore the effects of climatic and biogeographic events on morphological diversity at a continental scale. Methods. Based on a sample of 136 skulls of Dasypus spp. belonging to six species, including 112 specimens identified as D. novemcinctus, we studied the diversity and pattern of variation of paranasal cavities, which were reconstructed virtually using mCT-scanning or observed through bone transparency. Results. Our qualitative analyses of paranasal sinuses and recesses successfully retrieved a taxonomic differentiation between the traditional species D. kappleri, D. pilosus and D. novemcinctus but failed to recover diagnostic features between the disputed and morphologically similar D. septemcinctus and D. hybridus. Most interestingly, the high variation detected in our large sample of D. novemcinctus showed a clear geographical patterning, with the recognition of three well-separated morphotypes: one ranging from North and Central America and parts of northern South America west of the Andes, one distributed across the Amazonian Basin and central South America, and one restricted to the Guiana Shield. Discussion. The question as to whether these paranasal morphotypes may represent previously unrecognized species is to be evaluated through a thorough revision of the Dasypus species complex integrating molecular and morphological data. Remarkably, our recognition of a distinct morphotype in the Guiana Shield area is congruent with the recent discovery of a divergent mitogenomic lineage in French Guiana. The inflation of the second medialmost pair of caudal frontal sinuses constitutes an unexpected morphological diagnostic feature for this potentially distinct species. Our results demonstrate the benefits of studying overlooked internal morphological structures in supposedly cryptic species revealed by molecular data. It also illustrates the under-exploited potential of the highly variable paranasal sinuses of armadillos for systematic studies. © 2017 Billet et al.","Biogeography; Cingulata; Cranial pneumatization; Mammalia; Skull; Systematics; Xenarthra","anatomy; armadillo; biogeography; Central America; differentiation; French Guiana; habitat; model; morphotype; nonhuman; paranasal sinus; qualitative analysis; skull; species","Billet, G.; Sorbonne Universités, CR2P, UMR 7207, CNRS, Museum national d'Histoire naturelle, Université Paris 06, France; email: guillaume.billet@mnhn.fr",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027535522

To date, comprehensive descriptions of the former taxa are published; however, the mandibular materials of S. galbinensis have remained largely understudied since their initial description in 1979. Here we provide a comprehensive description of the well-preserved hemimandibles and dentition of S. galbinensis (MPC-D 100/80), from the Upper Cretaceous Bayanshiree Formation, Gobi Desert, Mongolia. The subrectangular and ventrally displaced caudal hemimandible, extreme ventral deflection of the rostral dentary, and edentulism of the caudal dentary of S. galbinensis are currently apomorphic among therizinosaurians. Unique, unreported dental traits including lingually folded mesial carinae, development of a denticulated triangular facet on the distal carinae near the cervix, and extracarinal accessory denticles, suggest a highly specialized feeding strategy in S. galbinensis. The presence of triple carinae on the distalmost lateral tooth crowns is also unique, although may represent an abnormality. Contrasted with the simplistic dentition of the contemporaneous therizinosaurid E. andrewsi, the dentition of S. galbinensis is indicative of niche partitioning in food acquisition, processing, or resources among known therizinosaurids inhabiting Asian ecosystems in the Late Cretaceous. Although not quantitatively correlated with diet, this suite of specializations is otherwise unique among theropod dinosaurs and supports derived inferences of facultative or obligate herbivory in therizinosaurids, ultimately adding novel information to our understanding of ecomorphology in theropods. © 2016 Zanno et al.","Anatomy; Cretaceous; Dentition; Dietary specializations; Dinosaur; Ecomorphology; Evolution; Herbivory; Therizinosaur; Theropod","Article; dentition; diet; dinosaur; ecological specialization; Erlikosaurus andrewsi; feeding behavior; herbivory; mandible; Mongolia; morphometrics; nonhuman; Segnosaurus galbinensis; tooth crown; Upper Cretaceous","Zanno, L.E.; Paleontology Research Lab, North Carolina Museum of Natural SciencesUnited States; email: lindsay.zanno@naturalsciences.org",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963969111

In this paper, we review all 33 named scarabaeine fossils and describe two new species from Dominican amber (Canthochilum alleni sp.n., Canthochilum philipsivieorum sp.n.).We provide a catalogue of all fossil Scarabaeinae and evaluate their assignment to this subfamily, based primarily on the original descriptions but also, where possible, by examining the type specimens. We suggest that only 21 fossil taxa can be reliably assigned to the Scarabaeinae, while the remaining 14 should be treated as doubtful Scarabaeinae. The doubtful scarabaeines include the two oldest dung beetle fossils known from the Cretaceous and we suggest excluding them from any assessments of the minimum age of scarabaeine dung beetles. The earliest reliably described scarabaeine fossil appears to be Lobateuchus parisii, known from Oise amber (France), which shifts the minimum age of the Scarabaeinae to the Eocene (53 Ma). We scored the best-preserved fossils, namely Lobateuchus and the two Canthochilum species described herein, into the character matrix used in a recent morphology-based study of dung beetles, and then inferred their phylogenetic relationships with Bayesian and parsimony methods. All analyses yielded consistent phylogenies where the two fossil Canthochilum are placed in a clade with the extant species of Canthochilum, and Lobateuchus is recovered in a clade with the extant genera Ateuchus and Aphengium. Additionally, we evaluated the distribution of dung beetle fossils in the light of current global dung beetle phylogenetic hypotheses, geological time and biogeography. The presence of only extant genera in the late Oligocene and all later records suggests that the main present-day dung beetle lineages had already been established by the late Oligocene-mid Miocene. ï¿½ 2016 Tarasov et al.","Canthochilum; Catalogue; Coleoptera; Dung beetles; Fossils; New species; Phylogeny; Scarabaeinae","age; Aphengium; Article; Ateuchus; Bayes theorem; beetle; biogeography; bone age; Canthochilum; fossil animal; geological time; Lobateuchus; nomenclature; nonhuman; paleontology; parsimony analysis; phylogeny; scoring system","Tarasov, S.; Department of Research and Collections, Natural History Museum, University of OsloNorway; email: sergxf@yandex.ru",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84971570002

The cetartiodactyl assemblage is dominated by bovids, with the specimen composition unique in the high recovery of horn cores and dominance of Antidorcas recki remains. Other cetartiodactyl and perissodactyl taxa are represented by few specimens, as are Hystrix and Procavia; the latter somewhat surprisingly so given their common occurrence at penecontemporaneous deposits in the region. Equally unusual (particularly given the size of the sample) is the identification of single specimens of giraffoid, elephantid and aardvark (Orycteropus cf. afer) that are rarely recovered from regional site deposits. Despite the diversity within the DMQ macromammalian faunas, there are few habitat- or biochronologically-sensitive species that provide specific ecologic or age boundaries for the deposits. Recovered species can only support the non-specific, mixed open-to-closed palaeohabitats around Drimolen that have been reconstructed for the other penecontemporaneous South African palaeokarst deposits. The identified Equus quagga ssp. specimens recovered from the floor of the current excavation (~-4.5-5 m below datum) suggests that most, if not all the DMQ specimens, were deposited after 2.33 Ma. Simultaneously, the carnivore specimens (D. cf. barlowi, L. silberbergi) suggest earlier Pleistocene (pre- 2.0-1.8 Ma) to maximally 1.6 Ma deposition (D. aff. piveteaui) for most of the DMQ fossil assemblage. © 2016 Adams et al.","Chasmaporthetes; Dinofelis; Homo; Lycyaenops; Megantereon; Paranthropus","aardvark; bovid; carnivore; family; fauna; fossil; habitat; horn; human; Lower Pleistocene; major clinical study; paleoecology; publication; quagga; South Africa; taxon","Adams, J.W.; Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash UniversityAustralia; email: justin.adams@monash.edu",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966400960

However, the knowledge of pliosaurid interrelationships remains limited. In part, this is a consequence of a few key taxa awaiting detailed reassessment. Among them, the taxon Polyptychodon is of special importance. It was established on isolated teeth from the mid-Cretaceous strata of East and South East England and subsequently associated with numerous finds of near-cosmopolitan distribution. Here the taxon is reassessed based on the original dental material from England, with special focus on a large collection of late Albian material from the Cambridge Greensand near Cambridge. The dental material is reviewed here from historical and stratigraphic perspective, described in detail, and discussed in terms of its diagnostic nature. The considerable morphological variability observed in the teeth attributed to Polyptychodon, together with a wide stratigraphic range of the ascribed material, possibly exceeding 35 Ma (early Aptian to ?middle Santonian), suggests that the taxon is based on a multispecies assemblage, possibly incorporating members of different plesiosaur clades. Due to the absence of any autapomorphic characters or unique character combinations in the original material, Polyptychodon interruptus, the type species of Polyptychodon, is considered nomen dubium. From a global perspective, Polyptychodon is viewed as a wastebasket taxon whose material originating from different localities should be reconsidered separately. ï¿½ 2016 Madzia.","Cambridge Greensand; Cretaceous; England; Plesiosauria; Pliosauridae; Polyptychodon; Teeth","dental material; age; amniote; apicobasal ridge; Article; Cretaceous; dentition; enamel; fossil animal; nonhuman; odontology; paleontology; Polyptychodon; Polyptychodon interruptus; taxon; United Kingdom","Madzia, D.; Institute of Paleobiology, Polish Academy of SciencesPoland; email: daniel.madzia@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84971575143

This group has unique and remarkable skeletal adaptations to powered flight, including pneumatic bones and an elongate digit IV supporting a wingmembrane. Two major body plans have traditionally been recognized: the primitive, primarily long-tailed paraphyletic ""rhamphorhynchoids"" (preferably currently recognized as non-pterodactyloids) and the derived short-tailed pterodactyloids. These two groups differ considerably in their general anatomy and also exhibit a remarkably different neuroanatomy and inferred head posture, which has been linked to different lifestyles and behaviours and improved flying capabilities in these reptiles. Pterosaur neuroanatomy, is known from just a few three-dimensionally preserved braincases of non-pterodactyloids (as Rhamphorhynchidae) and pterodactyloids, between which there is a large morphological gap. Here we report on a new Jurassic pterosaur from Argentina, Allkaruen koi gen. et sp. nov., remains of which include a superbly preserved, uncrushed braincase that sheds light on the origins of the highly derived neuroanatomy of pterodactyloids and their close relatives. A mCT ray-generated virtual endocast shows that the new pterosaur exhibits a mosaic of plesiomorphic and derived traits of the inner ear and neuroanatomy that fills an important gap between those of non-monofenestratan breviquartossans (Rhamphorhynchidae) and derived pterodactyloids. These results suggest that, while modularity may play an important role at one anatomical level, at a finer level the evolution of structures within a module may follow a mosaic pattern.

The TSLF is the largest opensite vertebrate fossil assemblage dating to the Rancholabrean North American Land Mammal Age in the southern Great Basin and Mojave Desert. Over 600 discrete body fossil localities have been recorded from the wash, including an area that now encompasses Tule Springs Fossil Beds National Monument (TUSK). Paleowetland sediments exposed in TUSK named the Las Vegas Formation span the last 250 ka, with fossiliferous sediments spanning ~100-13 ka. The recovered fauna is dominated by remains of Camelops and Mammuthus, and also includes relatively common remains of extinct Equus and Bison as well as abundant vertebrate microfaunal fossils. Large carnivorans are rare, with only Puma concolor and Panthera atrox documented previously. Postcranial remains assigned to the species Canis dirus (dire wolf) and Smilodon fatalis (sabre-toothed cat) represent the first confirmed records of these species from the TSLF, as well as the first documentation of Canis dirus in Nevada and the only known occurrence of Smilodon in southern Nevada. The size of the recovered canid fossil precludes assignment to other Pleistocene species of Canis. The morphology of the felid elements differentiates them from other large predators such as Panthera, Homotherium, and Xenosmilus, and the size of the fossils prevents assignment to other species of Smilodon. The confirmed presence of S. fatalis in the TSLF is of particular interest, indicating that this species inhabited open habitats. In turn, this suggests that the presumed preference of S. fatalis for closed-habitat environments hunting requires further elucidation. © 2016 Scott and Springer.","Canis dirus; Las Vegas Wash; Rancholabrean; Smilodon fatalis; Tule Springs","ground water; age; animal experiment; aquatic fauna; Article; biodiversity; Bison; Canis; Canis dirus; cat; desert; Equus; fossil animal; habitat; humerus; information processing; mammoth; morphological trait; nonhuman; paleontology; patella fracture; Puma concolor; Smilodon fatalis; spring; taxonomy; United States; Upper Pleistocene; wetland","Scott, E.; Division of Geological Sciences, San Bernardino County MuseumUnited States; email: CaptainFossil@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84977107064

Explanations of the function of these folded septa can be divided into physiological and mechanical hypotheses with the mechanical functions tending to find widespread support. The complexity of the cephalopod shell has made it difficult to directly test the mechanical properties of these structures without oversimplification of the septal morphology or extraction of a small sub-domain. However, the power of modern finite element analysis now permits direct testing of mechanical hypothesis on complete, empirical models of the shells taken from computed tomographic data. Here we compare, for the first time using empirical models, the capability of the shells of extant Nautilus pompilius, Spirula spirula, and the extinct ammonite Cadoceras sp. to withstand hydrostatic pressure and point loads. Results show hydrostatic pressure imparts highest stress on the final septum with the rest of the shell showing minimal compression. S. spirula shows the lowest stress under hydrostatic pressure while N. pompilius shows the highest stress. Cadoceras sp. shows the development of high stress along the attachment of the septal saddles with the shell wall. Stress due to point loads decreases when the point force is directed along the suture as opposed to the unsupported chamber wall. Cadoceras sp. shows the greatest decrease in stress between the point loads compared to all other models. Greater amplitude of septal flutes corresponds with greater stress due to hydrostatic pressure; however, greater amplitude decreases the stress magnitude of point loads directed along the suture. In our models, sutural complexity does not predict greater resistance to hydrostatic pressure but it does seem to increase resistance to point loads, such as would be from predators. This result permits discussion of palaeoecological reconstructions on the basis of septal morphology. We further suggest that the ratio used to characterize septal morphology in the septal strength index and in calculations of tensile strength of nacre are likely insufficient. A better understanding of the material properties of cephalopod nacre may allow the estimation of maximum depth limits of shelled cephalopods through finite element analysis. ï¿½ 2016 Lemanis et al.","Ammonoidea; Biomechanics; Computed tomography; Finite element analysis; Nautilida; Septal complexity","analytical parameters; Article; cephalopod; finite element analysis; hydrostatic pressure; loading test; nonhuman; ontogeny; paleoecology; phase contrast synchrotron tomography; septal strength index; septum morphology; shell strength; stress; tensile strength of nacre; tomography","Lemanis, R.; Institute of Geology, Mineralogy and Geophysics, Ruhr-Universitï¿½t BochumGermany; email: Robert.Lemanis@rub.de",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032069058

Feathers are the most complex multiform vertebrate integuments; they perform different functions, occurring in both avian and non-avian dinosaurs. Despite their rarity, fossil feathers have been found across the world. Most of the Brazilian feather fossil record comes from the Santana Formation. This formation is composed of two members: Crato (lake) and Romualdo (lagoon); both of which are predominantly reduced deposits, precluding bottom dwelling organisms, resulting in exceptional preservation of the fossils. Despite arid and hot conditions during the Cretaceous, life teemed in the adjacency of this paleolake. Feathered non-avian dinosaurs have not yet been described from the Crato Member, even though there are suggestions of their presence in nearby basins. Our description of the three feathers from the Crato laminated limestone reveals that, despite the small sample size, they can be referred to coelurosaurian theropods. Moreover, based on comparisons with extant feather morphotypes they can be identified as one contour feather and two downy feathers.

Zenkerella shows no anatomical adaptations for gliding, but has traditionally been grouped with the glider Idiurus on the basis of craniodental similarities, implying that either the Zenkerella lineage lost its gliding adaptations, or that Anomalurus and Idiurus evolved theirs independently. Here we present the first nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences of Zenkerella, based on recently recovered whole-body specimens from Bioko Island (Equatorial Guinea), which show unambiguously that Zenkerella is the sister taxon of Anomalurus and Idiurus. These data indicate that gliding likely evolved only once within Anomaluridae, and that there were no subsequent evolutionary reversals. We combine this new molecular evidence with morphological data from living and extinct anomaluromorph rodents and estimate that the lineage leading to Zenkerella has been evolving independently in Africa since the early Eocene, approximately 49 million years ago. Recently discovered fossils further attest to the antiquity of the lineage leading to Zenkerella, which can now be recognized as a classic example of a ""living fossil,"" about which we know remarkably little. The osteological markers of gliding are estimated to have evolved along the stem lineage of the Anomalurus-Idiurus clade by the early Oligocene, potentially indicating that this adaptation evolved in response to climatic perturbations at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary (~34 million years ago). © 2016 Heritage et al.","Anomaluridae; Bioko Island; Eocene; Equatorial Guinea; Gliding; Mammals; Oligocene; Patagium; Phylogeny","Article; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; DNA extraction; DNA purification; DNA sequence; evolution; female; gene amplification; male; nonhuman; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; rodent; Zenkerella","Heritage, S.; Interdepartmental Doctoral Program in Anthropological Sciences, Stony Brook UniversityUnited States; email: steven.heritage@stonybrook.edu",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992166471

Several Triassic track ichnoassemblages and ichnotaxa have a restricted stratigraphic range and are useful in biochronology and biostratigraphy. The record of Triassic tracks in the Iberian Peninsula has gone almost unnoticed although more than 25 localities have been described since 1897. In one of these localities, the naturalist Longinos Navás described the ichnotaxon Chirotherium ibericus in 1906.The vertebrate tracks are in two sandy slabs from the Anisian (Middle Triassic) of the Moncayo massif (Zaragoza, Spain). In a recent revision, new, previously undescribed vertebrate tracks have been identified. The tracks considered to be C. ibericus as well as other tracks with the same morphology from both slabs have been classified as Chirotherium barthii. The rest of the tracks have been assigned to Chirotheriidae indet., Rhynchosauroides isp. and undetermined material. This new identification of C. barthii at the Navás site adds new data to the Iberian record of this ichnotaxon, which is characterized by the small size of the tracks when compared with the main occurrences of this ichnotaxon elsewhere. As at the Navás tracksite, the Anisian C. barthii-Rhynchosauroides ichnoassemblage has been found in other coeval localities in Iberia and worldwide. This ichnoassemblage belongs to the upper Olenekian-lower Anisian interval according to previous biochronological proposals. Analysis of the Triassic Iberian record of tetrapod tracks is uneven in terms of abundance over time. From the earliest Triassic to the latest Lower Triassic the record is very scarce, with Rhynchosauroides being the only known ichnotaxon. Rhynchosauroides covers a wide temporal range and gives poor information for biochronology. The record from the uppermost Lower Triassic to the Middle Triassic is abundant. The highest ichnodiversity has been reported for the Anisian with an assemblage composed of Dicynodontipus, Procolophonichnium, Rhynchosauroides, Rotodactylus, Chirotherium, Isochirotherium, Coelurosaurichnus and Paratrisauropus. The Iberian track record from the Anisian is coherent with the global biochronology proposed for Triassic tetrapod tracks. Nevertheless, the scarcity of track occurrences during the late Olenekian and Ladinian prevents analysis of the corresponding biochrons. Finally, although the Iberian record for the Upper Triassic is not abundant, the presence of Eubrontes, Anchisauripus and probably Brachychirotherium is coherent with the global track biochronology as well. Thus, the Triassic track record in the Iberian Peninsula matches the expected record for this age on the basis of a global biochronological approach, supporting the idea that vertebrate Triassic tracks are a useful tool in biochronology. © 2015 Díaz-Martínez et al.","Chirotherium barthii; Chirotherium ibericus; Iberian Peninsula; Middle Triassic; Triassic geochronology; Vertebrate tracks","Article; biostratigraphy; Chirotheriidae; Chirotherium ibericus; coastal plain; evolution; fossil; limb; Middle Triassic; nonhuman; Rhynchosauroides; sand; taxon; tetrapod","Díaz-Martínez, I.; CONICET-Instituto de Investigación en Paleobiología y Geología, Universidad Nacional de Río NegroArgentina",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944738902

In Theropoda, the morphology of the quadrate is particularly complex and varies importantly among different clades of non-avian theropods, therefore conferring a strong taxonomic potential. Inconsistencies in the notation and terminology used in discussions of the theropod quadrate anatomy have been noticed, including at least one instance when no less than eight different terms were given to the same structure. A standardized list of terms and notations for each quadrate anatomical entity is proposed here, with the goal of facilitating future descriptions of this important cranial bone. In addition, an overview of the literature on quadrate function and pneumaticity in non-avian theropods is presented, along with a discussion of the inferences that could be made from this research. Specifically, the quadrate of the large majority of non-avian theropods is akinetic but the diagonally oriented intercondylar sulcus of the mandibular articulation allowed both rami of the mandible to move laterally when opening the mouth in many of theropods. Pneumaticity of the quadrate is also present in most averostran clades and the pneumatic chamber-invaded by the quadrate diverticulum of the mandibular arch pneumatic system-was connected to one or several pneumatic foramina on the medial, lateral, posterior, anterior or ventral sides of the quadrate. © 2015 Hendrickx et al.","Anatomy; Dinosaur; Mandibular articulation; Quadrate; Terminology; Theropod","anatomy; anterior intercondylar notch; anterior pneumatic foramen; Article; dinosaur; dorsal pneumatic foramen; dorsal projection; dorsal quadratojugal contact; ectocondyle; entocondyle; intercapitular sulcus; intercondylar sulcus; lateral pneumatic fossa; lateroventral process; mandible; mandibular articulation; medial fossa; medial pneumatic foramen; mediocondyle; nonhuman; otic capitulum; posterior fossa; posterior intercondylar notch; posterior pneumatic foramen; posterior pneumatic fossa; pterygoid contact; pterygoid flange; quadrate foramen; quadrate head; quadrate pneumatic chamber; quadrate ridge; quadrate ridge groove; quadrate shaft; quadratojugal contact; quadratojugal process; skull; squamosal capitulum; squamosal contact; Theropod; ventral pneumatic foramen; ventral projection; ventral quadratojugal contact; ventral shelf","Hendrickx, C.; Departamento de Ciências da Terra, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, GeoBioTec, Faculdade de Ciências e TecnologiaPortugal",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944878790

Originally, Prophoca rousseaui and Prophoca proxima were described based on fragmentary remains from the Miocene of Belgium. However, several researchers contested the union of Prophoca rousseaui and Prophoca proxima into one genus, without providing evidence. The stratigraphic context of Prophoca remained poorly constrained due to the lack of precise data associated with the original specimens collected in the area of Antwerp (north of Belgium). Methods: Prophoca and Leptophoca are redescribed and their phylogenetic position among Phocidae is reassessed using PAUP. Dinoflagellate biostratigraphy has been carried out on sediment samples associated with specimens from Prophoca and Leptophoca to elucidate their approximate ages. Results: Whereas the species Prophoca rousseaui is redescribed, Prophoca proxima is considered synonymous to Leptophoca lenis, with the proposal of a new combination Leptophoca proxima (Van Beneden, 1877). Sediment samples from specimens of both taxa have been dated to the late Langhian-early Serravallian (middle Miocene). Following a reinvestigation of Leptophoca amphiatlantica, characters from the original diagnosis are questioned and the specimens of Leptophoca amphiatlantica are considered Leptophoca cf. L. proxima. In a phylogenetic analysis, Prophoca rousseaui and Leptophoca proxima constitute early branching stem-phocines. Discussion: Leptophoca proxima from the North Sea Basin is younger than the oldest known find of Leptophoca proxima from North America, which does not contradict the hypothesis that Phocinae originated along the east coast of North America during the late early Miocene, followed by dispersal to Europe shortly after. Morphological features of the appendicular skeleton indicate that Prophoca rousseaui and Leptophoca proxima have archaic locomotory modes, retaining a more prominent use of the fore flipper for aquatic propulsion than extant Phocidae. © 2017 Dewaele et al.","Biogeography; Biostratigraphy; Leptophoca; Miocene; North atlantic; Phocidae; Phylogeny; Prophoca; Redescription","appendicular skeleton; Belgium; biogeography; biostratigraphy; diagnosis; dinoflagellate; human; human tissue; Langhian; nonhuman; North America; North Sea; Phocidae; phylogeny; seashore; sediment; Serravallian; species","Dewaele, L.; Department of Geology, Ghent UniversityBelgium; email: leonard.dewaele@ugent.be",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013818467

Synchrotron scanning of the tapinocephalid Moschops capensis reveals, for the first time, numerous anatomical adaptations of the central nervous system related to this combative behaviour. Many neural structures (such as the brain, inner ear and ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve) were completely enclosed and protected by bones, which is unusual for non-mammaliaform therapsids. The nearly complete ossification of the braincase enables precise determination of the brain cavity volume and encephalization quotient, which appears greater than expected for such a large and early herbivore. The practice of head butting is often associated with complex social behaviours and gregariousness in extant species, which are known to influence brain size evolution. Additionally, the plane of the lateral (horizontal) semicircular canal of the bony labyrinth is oriented nearly vertically if the skull is held horizontally, which suggests that the natural position of the head was inclined about 60-65° to the horizontal. This is consistent with the fighting position inferred from osteology, as well as ground-level browsing. Finally, the unusually large parietal tube may have been filled with thick conjunctive tissue to protect the delicate pineal eye from injury sustained during head butting. © 2017 Benoit et al.","Bony labyrinth; Dinocephalia; Endocast; Head butting; Moschops; Trigeminal nerve","Article; body mass; body position; dinosaur; dura mater; encephalization; endocast; head; inner ear; Moschops capensis; neurology; nonhuman; palaeoneurology; skull; tomography; trigeminal nerve","Benoit, J.; Evolutionary Institute, School of Geosciences, University of the WitwatersrandSouth Africa; email: julien.benoit@wits.ac.za",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027354845

The diverse dinosaur fauna of the Arundel Clay has been thoroughly discussed previously, but a few of the dinosaur species originally described from the Arundel Clay are still regarded as valid genera. Much of the Arundel material is in need of review and redescription. Among the fossils of dinosaurs from this stratigraphic unit are those referred to ornithomimosaurs.

Recent discoveries of small theropod material from the Arundel Clay possibly belonging to ornithomimosaurs are also reviewed and described for the first time. The description of the Arundel material herein along with recent discoveries of basal ornithomimosaurs in the past 15 years has allowed for comparisons with the coelurosaur Nedcolbertia justinhofmanni, suggesting the latter animal was a basal ornithomimosaur rather than a ""generalized"" coelurosaur as it was originally described.

Associated skeletons show that azhdarchids were long-necked, long-jawed predators that combined a wing planform suited for soaring with limb adaptations indicative of quadrupedal terrestrial foraging. The postcranial proportions of the group have been regarded as uniform overall, irrespective of their overall size, notwithstanding suggestions that minor variation may have been present. Here, we discuss a recently discovered giant azhdarchid neck vertebra referable to Hatzegopteryx from the Maastrichtian Sebeş Formation of the Transylvanian Basin, Romania, which shows how some azhdarchids departed markedly from conventional views on their proportions. This vertebra, which we consider a cervical VII, is 240 mm long as preserved and almost as wide. Among azhdarchid cervicals, it is remarkable for the thickness of its cortex (4-6 mm along its ventral wall) and robust proportions. By comparing its dimensions to other giant azhdarchid cervicals and to the more completely known necks of smaller taxa, we argue that Hatzegopteryx had a proportionally short, stocky neck highly resistant to torsion and compression. This specimen is one of several hinting at greater disparity within Azhdarchidae than previously considered, but is the first to demonstrate such proportional differences within giant taxa. On the assumption that other aspects of Hatzegopteryx functional anatomy were similar to those of other azhdarchids, and with reference to the absence of large terrestrial predators in the Maastrichtian of Transylvania, we suggest that this pterosaur played a dominant predatory role among the unusual palaeofauna of ancient Haţeg. ï¿½ 2017 Naish and Witton.","Azhdarchids; Biomechanics; Cretaceous; Maastrichtian; Pterosaurs","Article; azhdarchidae; biomechanics; bone length; Chordata; functional anatomy; neck; neck length; nonhuman; physical parameters; predator; species diversity; taxonomy; vertebra; vertebral strength; Young modulus","Naish, D.; Ocean and Earth Science, University of SouthamptonUnited Kingdom; email: eotyrannus@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013167727

Lluís Companys 23, Barcelona, Spain","Background. The Eocene was the warmest epoch of the Cenozoic and recorded the appearance of several orders of modern mammals, including the first occurrence of Euprimates. During the Eocene, Euprimates were mainly represented by two groups, adapiforms and omomyiforms, which reached great abundance and diversity in the Northern Hemisphere. Despite this relative abundance, the record of early Eocene primates from the European continent is still scarce and poorly known, preventing the observation of clear morphological trends in the evolution of the group and the establishment of phylogenetic relationships among different lineages. However, knowledge about the early Eocene primates from the Iberian Peninsula has been recently increased through the description of new material of the genus Agerinia from several fossil sites from Northeastern Spain. Methods. Here we present the first detailed study of the euprimate material from the locality of Masia de l'Hereuet (early Eocene, NE Spain). The described remains consist of one fragment of mandible and 15 isolated teeth. This work provides detailed descriptions, accurate measurements, high-resolution figures and thorough comparisons with other species of Agerinia as well with other Eurasian notharctids. Furthermore, the position of the different species of Agerinia has been tested with two phylogenetic analyses. Results. The new material from Masia de l'Hereuet shows several traits that were previously unknown for the genus Agerinia, such as the morphology of the upper and lower fourth deciduous premolars and the P2, and the unfused mandible. Moreover, this material clearly differs from the other described species of Agerinia, A. roselli and A. smithorum, thus allowing the erection of the new species Agerinia marandati. The phylogenetic analyses place the three species of Agerinia in a single clade, in which A. smithorum is the most primitive species of this genus. Discussion. The morphology of the upper molars reinforces the distinction of Agerinia from other notharctids like Periconodon. The analysis of the three described species of the genus, A. smithorum, A. marandati and A. roselli, reveals a progressive change in several morphological traits such as the number of roots and the position of the P1 and P2, the molarization of the P4, the reduction of the paraconid on the lower molars and the displacement of the mental foramina.

First collected and described in the late 19th century from the upper Silurian Saaremaa Clifflocality in Estonia, it is known from a wealth of disarticulated scales, fin spines, and bone fragments. In this study we provide the first description of the morphology and paleohistology of a fin spine and scale from Lophosteus using virtual thin sections and 3D reconstructions that were segmented using phase-contrast synchrotron X-ray microtomography. These data reveal that both structures have fully or partially buried odontodes, which retain fine morphological details in older generations, including sharp nodes and serrated ridgelets. The vascular architecture of the fin spine tip, which is composed of several layers of longitudinally directed bone vascular canals, is much more complex compared to the bulbous horizontal canals within the scale, but they both have distinctive networks of ascending canals within each individual odontode. Other histological characteristics that can be observed from the data are cell spaces and Sharpey's fibers that, when combined with the vascularization, could help to provide insights into the growth of the structure. The 3D data of the scales from Lophosteus superbus is similar to comparable data from other fossil osteichthyans, and the morphology of the reconstructed buried odontodes from this species is identical to scale material of Lophosteus ohesaarensis, casting doubt on the validity of that species. The 3D data presented in this paper is the first for fossil fin spines and so comparable data is not yet available. However, the overall morphology and histology seems to be similar to the structure of placoderm dermal plates. The 3D datasets presented here provide show that microtomography is a powerful tool for investigating the three-dimensional microstructure of fossils, which is difficult to study using traditional histological methods. These results also increase the utility of fin spines and scales suggest that these data are a potentially rich source of morphological data that could be used for studying questions relating to early vertebrate growth and evolution. ï¿½ 2016 Jerve et al.","Fin spine; Lophosteus; Paleohistology; Paleontology; Scale; Synchrotron","Article; bone cell; cellular distribution; evolution; fin (organ); fish; fossil; histology; Lophosteus superbus; micro-computed tomography; morphology; nonhuman; osteocyte; paleontology; spine; vascularization; vertebrate","Jerve, A.; Department of Organismal Biology, Uppsala UniversitetSweden; email: ajerve@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994553289

Although a number of different clustering methods are widely used, the approach and underlying assumptions of many of these methods are quite different. For example, methods may be hierarchical or non-hierarchical in their approaches, and may use Euclidean distance or non-Euclidean indices to cluster the data. In order to assess the effectiveness of the different clustering methods as compared to one another, a simulation was designed that could assess each method over a range of both cluster distinctiveness and sampling intensity. Additionally, a non-hierarchical, non-Euclidean, iterative clustering method implemented in the R Statistical Language is described. This method, Non-Euclidean Relational Clustering (NERC), creates distinct clusters by dividing the data set in order to maximize the average similarity within each cluster, identifying clusters in which each data point is on average more similar to those within its own group than to those in any other group. While all the methods performed well with clearly differentiated and well-sampled datasets, when data are less than ideal the linkage methods perform poorly compared to non-Euclidean based k-means and the NERC method. Based on this analysis, Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean and neighbor joining methods are less reliable with incomplete datasets like those found in palaeobiological analyses, and the k-means and NERC methods should be used in their place. © 2016 Vavrek.","Adjusted Rand Index; Biogeography; Cluster analysis; Ecological similarity; Palaeoecology","arithmetic; biogeography; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; fossil; human; human experiment; intermethod comparison; language; neighbor joining method; sampling","Vavrek, M.J.; Department of Natural History, Royal Ontario MuseumCanada; email: matthew@matthewvavrek.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963956121

Traits distinguishing this new specimen from other wukongopterid pterosaurs include a premaxilla with a low ossified anterodorsal crest, a nasal bearing the most elongated process known in the Wukongopteridae, and a lacrimal that has a foramen in its middle portion. The new kind of premaxillary crest preserved in IVPP V 17959 suggests that the presence or absence of a premaxillary crest might be an interspecific feature within the Wukongopteridae.

The mongolepid dermal skeleton exhibits a rare type of atubular dentine (lamellin) that is regarded as one of the diagnostic features of the Order within crown gnathostomes. The previously erected Mongolepididae and Shiqianolepidae families are revised, differentiated by scale-base histology and expanded to include the genera Rongolepis and Xinjiangichthys, respectively. A newly described mongolepid species (Solinalepis levis gen. et sp. nov.) from the Ordovician of North America is treated as family incertae sedis, as it possesses a type of basal bone tissue (acellular and vascular) that has yet to be documented in other mongolepids. This study extends the stratigraphic and palaeogeographic range of Mongolepidida and adds further evidence for an early diversification of the Chondrichthyes in the Ordovician Period, 50 million years prior to the first recorded appearance of euchondrichthyan teeth in the Lower Devonian. © 2016 Andreev et al.","Mongolepids; Morphogenesis; Odontocomplex; Ordovician; Scales; Solinalepis gen. nov.","cartilaginous fish; China; cladistics; Colorado; dentin; dermis; enamel; family; histology; human; human tissue; Lower Devonian; Mongolia; morphogenesis; morphological trait; skeleton; species; trabecular bone; Upper Ordovician","Andreev, P.; School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of BirminghamUnited Kingdom; email: p.andreev@bham.ac.uk",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84977144676

Bones are shaped by the interaction of historical (phylogenetic), structural, and functional constrains. Consequently, bone shape has been investigated intensively in an evolutionary context. Geometric morphometric approaches allow the description of the shape of an object in all of its biological complexity. However, when biological objects present only few anatomical landmarks, sliding semi-landmarks may provide good descriptors of shape. The sliding procedure, mandatory for sliding semi-landmarks, requires several steps that may be time-consuming. We here compare the time required by two different software packages ('Edgewarp' and 'Morpho') for the same sliding task, and investigate potential differences in the results and biological interpretation. 'Morpho' is much faster than 'Edgewarp,' notably as a result of the greater computational power of the 'Morpho' software routines and the complexity of the 'Edgewarp' workflow. Morphospaces obtained using both software packages are similar and provide a consistent description of the biological variability. The principal differences between the two software packages are observed in areas characterized by abrupt changes in the bone topography. In summary, both software packages performequally well in terms of the description of biological structures, yet differ in the simplicity of the workflow and time needed to performthe analyses. © 2015 Botton-Divet et al.","Geometric morphometrics; Sliding semi-landmark; Software comparison","anatomic landmark; anatomical concepts; Article; biological model; computer model; computer program; evaluation study; humerus; image processing; morphometrics; Mustelidae; nonhuman; principal component analysis; three dimensional imaging","Botton-Divet, L.; UMR 7179, Mécadev, Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Centre National de la Recherche ScientifiqueFrance; email: lbottondivet@mnhn.fr",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949635233

The holotype is an almost perfectly preserved cervical vertebra of disputed anatomical location. Although there is also uncertainty regarding this animal's size, other specimens that have been assigned to this species include fragments of two humeri, a radius, metacarpi and teeth. Here we estimate neck length, leg length and body mass using interspecific and, unusually, ontogenetic allometry of extant giraffe skeletal parameters. The appropriateness of each equation to estimate body mass was evaluated by calculating the prediction error incurred in both extant giraffes (G. camelopardalis) and okapis (Okapia johnstoni). It followed that the equations with the lowest prediction error in both species were considered robust enough to use in G. sivalensis. The size of G. sivalensis, based on the holotype, is proposed as 400 kg (range 228 kg-575 kg), with a neck length of approximately 147 cm and a height of 390 cm. The molar lengths of tooth specimens considered agree with this size estimate. The humerus was the most appropriate long bone to establish body mass, which estimates a heavier animal of ca 790 kg. The discrepancy with the vertebral body weight estimate might indicate sexual dimorphism. Radial and metacarpal specimens estimate G. sivalensis to be as heavy as extant giraffes. This may indicate that the radius and metacarpus are unsuitable for body mass predictions in Giraffa spp. Alternatively, certain long bones may have belonged to another long legged giraffid that occurred during the same period and locality as G. sivalensis. We have concluded that if sexual dimorphism was present then males would have been about twice the size of females. If sexual dimorphism was not present and all bones were correctly attributed to this species, then G. sivalensis had a slender neck with a relatively stocky body. © 2015 van Sittert and Mitchell.","Allometry; Body mass; Giraffa; Giraffidae; Neck length; Okapia; Plio-Pleistocene; Scaling; Siwalik","allometry; anatomical concepts; Article; Artiodactyla; body height; extinct species; fossil; geographic distribution; geographical variation (species); Giraffa sivalensis; giraffe; nonhuman; sex difference; stratigraphy; vertebra body","Van Sittert, S.J.; Centre for Veterinary Wildlife Studies, Department of Production Animal Studies, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of PretoriaSouth Africa; email: sybrandvs@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940385852

This revealed critical features of the column, distal arms, and aboral cup, which were hidden in the surrounding rock and would have been inaccessible without the application of micro-CT. Iocrinus africanus sp. nov. is characterized by the presence of seven to thirteen tertibrachials, three in-line bifurcations per ray, and an anal sac that is predominantly unplated or very lightly plated. Iocrinus is a common genus in North America (Laurentia) and has also been reported fromthe United Kingdom(Avalonia) and Oman (middle east Gondwana). Together with Merocrinus, it represents one of the few geographically widespread crinoids during the Ordovician and serves to demonstrate that faunal exchanges between Laurentia and Gondwana occurred at this time.

We find that despite the regular shape in equatorial and axial thin section the irregular 3D chamber shape is not predicted by these sections.We argue that 3D reconstructions of Nummulites tests will be a great aid in improving our understanding of lineages within the genus Nummulites, and to elucidate its evolutionary and biogeographical history. © 2015 Renema and Cotton.","Character evaluation; Computed microtomography; Large benthic foraminifera; Micropaleontology","alar prolongation; Article; benthic foraminifera; biogeography; biostratigraphy; eukaryote evolution; imaging; marine environment; nonhuman; Nummulites djokdjokartae; Paleogene; paleontology; three dimensional imaging; two dimensional imaging; Foraminifera; Nummulites","Renema, W.; Naturalis Biodiversity CenterNetherlands",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84935510669

The preserved teeth show the unusual dental characteristics of members of the rare and poorly documented Picrodontidae family, including an elongated centrocrista and wide occlusal surface. The new species is placed within the genus Zanycteris (represented by a single specimen from southern Colorado). This placement is based on similarities in regard to the parastyle, curvilinear centrocrista, and wider anterior stylar shelf on the upper molars. However, the new species differs from the only known species of Zanycteris in exhibiting an upper first molar that is 30%larger in area, while retaining a similarly sized upper second molar. Phylogenetic analysis supports the separation of the Picrodontidae family from the Paromomyidae, while still recognizing picrodontids position within Pleisadapiformes. The unusual dental features of the upper molars likely functioned in life as an enhanced shearing surface between the centrocrista and cristid obliqua crests for a specialized diet of fruit. A similar arrangement is found in the living bat Ariteus (Jamaican fig-eating bat), which feeds on fleshy fruit.

Despite the greater amount of ecomorphological information compiled for extant rodent species, studies usually lack of morphological data on dentition, which has led to difficulty in directly utilizing existing ecomorphological data of extant rodents for paleoecological reconstruction because teeth are the most common or often the only micromammal fossils. Here, we infer the environmental ranges of extinct rodent genera by extracting habitat information from extant relatives and linking it to extinct taxa based on the phenogram of the cluster analysis, in which variables are derived from the principal component analysis on outline shape of the upper first molars. This phenotypic ''bracketing'' approach is particularly useful in the study of the fossil record of small mammals, which is mostly represented by isolated teeth. As a case study, we utilize extinct genera of murines and non-arvicoline cricetids, ranging from the Iberoccitanian latest middle Miocene to the Mio-Pliocene boundary, and compare our results thoroughly with previous paleoecological reconstructions inferred by different methods. The resultant phenogram shows a predominance of ubiquitous genera among the Miocene taxa, and the presence of a few forest specialists in the two rodent groups (Murinae and Cricetidae), along with the absence of open environment specialists in either group of rodents. This appears to be related to the absence of enduring grassland biomes in the Iberian Peninsula during the late Miocene. High consistency between our result and previous studies suggests that this phenotypic ''bracketing'' approach is a very useful tool. © 2017 Gomez Cano et al.","Dental morphology; Ecological characterization; Fourier analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Mammalia; Miocene; Paleoecology; Phenogram; Rodentia","animal experiment; biome; cluster analysis; Cricetidae; forest; fossil; Fourier analysis; grassland; human; Middle Miocene; molar tooth; morphology; morphometry; murine; nonhuman; paleoecology; Pliocene; principal component analysis; relative; small mammal; Upper Miocene; Western Europe","Gomez Cano, A.R.; Institut Català de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont, Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona, Cerdanyola del VallèsSpain; email: argomezcano@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029783673

In contrast to its low diversity today (less than 20 species in six genera), it has the richest fossil record of any extant group of ferns. The structurally preserved trunks and rhizomes alone are referable to more than 100 fossil species that are classified in up to 20 genera, four subfamilies, and two families. This diverse fossil record constitutes an exceptional source of information on the evolutionary history of the group from the Permian to the present. However, inconsistent terminology, varying formats of description, and the general lack of a uniform taxonomic concept renders this wealth of information poorly accessible. To this end, we provide a comprehensive review of the diversity of structural features of osmundalean axes under a standardized, descriptive terminology. A novel morphological character matrix with 45 anatomical characters scored for 15 extant species and for 114 fossil operational units (species or specimens) is analysed using networks in order to establish systematic relationships among fossil and extant Osmundales rooted in axis anatomy. The results lead us to propose an evolutionary classification for fossil Osmundales and a revised, standardized taxonomy for all taxa down to the rank of (sub)genus. We introduce several nomenclatural novelties: (1) a new subfamily Itopsidemoideae (Guaireaceae) is established to contain Itopsidema, Donwelliacaulis, and Tiania; (2) the thamnopteroid genera Zalesskya, Iegosigopteris, and Petcheropteris are all considered synonymous with Thamnopteris; (3) 12 species of Millerocaulis and Ashicaulis are assigned to modern genera (tribe Osmundeae); (4) the hitherto enigmatic Aurealcaulis is identified as an extinct subgenus of Plenasium; and (5) the poorly known Osmundites tuhajkulensis is assigned to Millerocaulis. In addition, we consider Millerocaulis stipabonettiorum a possible member of Palaeosmunda and Millerocaulis estipularis as probably constituting the earliest representative of the (Todea-)Leptopteris lineage (subtribe Todeinae) of modern Osmundoideae. © 2017 Bomfleur et al.","Anatomy; Evolutionary classification; Ferns; Filicopsida; Guaireaceae; Leptosporangiatae; Network analysis; Osmundaceae; Phylogeny; Taxonomy","anatomy; extant species; fossil; genus; human; human tissue; morphological trait; nomenclature; nonhuman; Permian; phylogeny; Polypodiopsida; rhizome; trunk","Bomfleur, B.; Institut für Geologie und Paläontologie, Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität MünsterGermany; email: bbomfleur@uni-muenster.de",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85022329376

The evolution of South American Mabuyinae skinks holds significant biogeographic interest because its sister lineage is distributed across the African continent and adjacent islands. Moreover, at least one insular species, Trachylepis atlantica, has independently reached the New World through transoceanic dispersal. To clarify the evolutionary history of both Neotropical lineages, this study aimed to infer an updated timescale using the largest species and gene sampling dataset ever assembled for this group. By extending the analysis to the Scincidae family, we could employ fossil information to estimate mabuyinae divergence times and carried out a formal statistical biogeography analysis. To unveil macroevolutionary patterns, we also inferred diversification rates for this lineage and evaluated whether the colonization of South American continent significantly altered the mode of Mabuyinae evolution. Methods. A time-calibrated phylogeny was inferred under the Bayesian framework employing fossil information. This timetree was used to (i) evaluate the historical biogeography of mabuiyines using the statistical approach implemented in Bio- GeoBEARS; (ii) estimate macroevolutionary diversification rates of the South American Mabuyinae lineages and the patterns of evolution of selected traits, namely, the mode of reproduction, body mass and snout-vent length; (iii) test the hypothesis of differential macroevolutionary patterns in South American lineages in BAMM and GeoSSE; and (iv) re-evaluate the ancestral state of the mode of reproduction of mabuyines. Results. Our results corroborated the hypothesis that the occupation of the South American continent by Mabuyinae consisted of two independent dispersion events that occurred between the Oligocene and the Miocene. We found significant differences in speciation rates between the New World and the remaining Mabuyinae clades only in GeoSSE. The influence of phenotypic traits on diversification rates was not supported by any method. Ancestral state reconstruction suggested that the ancestor of South American mabuyine was likely viviparous. Discussion. Our analyses further corroborated the existence of a transoceanic connection between Africa and South America in the Eocene/Oligocene period (Atlantogea). Following colonization of the isolated South America and subsequent dispersal through the continent by the ancestral mabuyine stock, we detected no difference in macroevolutionary regimes of New World clades. This finding argued against the ecological opportunity model as an explanation for the diversity of living mabuyines. © 2017 Pereira and Schrago.

Two exceptional fossils of Galesaurus planiceps and Thrinaxodon liorhinus, consisting of juveniles closely associated with an adult, were briefly described more than 50 years ago as examples of parental care in nonmammaliaform cynodonts. However, these two Early Triassic fossils have largely been excluded from recent discussions of parental care in the fossil record. Here we reanalyse these fossils in the context of an extensive survey of other aggregations found in these two basal cynodont taxa. Our analysis revealed six other unequivocal cases of aggregations in Thrinaxodon, with examples of same-age aggregations among immature or adult individuals as well as mixed-age aggregations between subadult and adult individuals. In contrast, only one additional aggregation of Galesaurus was identified. Taking this comprehensive survey into account, the two previously described cases of parental care in Galesaurus and Thrinaxodon are substantiated. The juveniles are the smallest specimens known for each taxon, and the size difference between the adult and the two associated juveniles is the largest found for any of the aggregations. The juveniles of Thrinaxodon are approximately only 37% of the associated adult size; whereas in Galesaurus, the young are at least 60% of the associated adult size. In each case, the two juvenile individuals are similar in size, suggesting they were from the same clutch. Even though parental care was present in both Galesaurus and Thrinaxodon, intraspecific aggregations were much more common in Thrinaxodon, suggesting it regularly lived in aggregations consisting of both similar and different aged individuals. ï¿½ 2017 Jasinoski and Abdala.","Epicynodont; Grouping; Parental care; Sexual dimorphism; Social behaviour; South Africa","adolescent; adult; case report; fossil; human; juvenile; Lower Triassic; nonhuman; parental behavior; sex difference; social behavior; South Africa; subadult; taxon","Jasinoski, S.C.; Evolutionary Studies Institute, University of the WitwatersrandSouth Africa; email: sandra_jas@hotmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013200596

Water diversions in the past century turned the Colorado River Delta from a normal estuary to a hypersaline inverse estuary, raising concerns for the local fauna, much of which is endangered. Salinity differences are known to generate ecological species pairs and we anticipated that loss of the fresher-water historic salinity regime could alter the adaptive factors maintaining distinction between the broadly distributed Gulf-endemic Colpichthys regis and the narrowly restricted Delta-endemic Colpichthys hubbsi, the species that experienced dramatic environmental change. In this altered environmental context, these longisolated species (as revealed by Cytochrome b sequences) show genotypic (RAG1, microsatellites) evidence of active hybridization where the species ranges abut, as well as directional introgression from C. regis into the range center of C. hubbsi. Bayesian group assignment (STRUCTURE) on six microsatellite loci and multivariate analyses (DAPC) on both microsatellites and phenotypic data further support substantial recent admixture between the sister species. Although we find no evidence for recent population decline in C. hubbsi based on mitochondrial sequence, introgression may be placing an ancient ecological species at risk of extinction. Such introgressive extinction risk should also pertain to other ecological species historically sustained by the now changing Delta environment. More broadly, salinity gradient associated ecological speciation is evident in silverside species pairs in many estuarine systems around the world. Ecological species pairs among other taxa in such systems are likely poorly understood or cryptic. As water extraction accelerates in river systems worldwide, salinity gradients will necessarily be altered, impacting many more estuary and delta systems. Such alteration of habitats will place biodiversity at risk not only from direct effects of habitat destruction, but also from the potential for the breakdown of ecological species. Thus, evolutionary response to the anthropogenic alteration of salinity gradients in estuaries merits investigation as the number of impacted systems increases around the globe, permitting parallel study of multiple systems, while also permitting a conservation management response to help preserve this little championed component of biodiversity. © 2017 Lau and Jacobs.","Colorado River Delta; Colpichthys; Ecological species; Endemic species; Extinction through hybridization; Gulf of California; Hybridization; Introgression","cytochrome b; Article; Atheriniformes; biodiversity; biogeography; Colpichthys hubbsi; Colpichthys regis; DNA isolation; estuary; genotype; geomorphology; haplotype; hybridization; introgression; microsatellite instability; morphometry; nonhuman; Pleistocene; polymerase chain reaction; salinity","Jacobs, D.K.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of CaliforniaUnited States; email: djacobs@ucla.edu",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037830840

Most feet had multiple categories of pathological change (81% with two or more diagnoses, versus 10% with a single diagnosis, and 9% without significant pathology). Much of the pathological change was focused over the middle/lateral digits, which bear most weight and experience high peak pressures during walking. We found remodelling and osteoarthritis to be correlated with increasing age, more enthesopathy in Asian elephants, and more cyst-like lesions in females. We also observed multipartite, missing and misshapen phalanges as common and apparently incidental findings. The proximal (paired) sesamoids can appear fused or absent, and the predigits (radial/tibial sesamoids) can be variably ossified, though are significantly more ossified in Asian elephants.

Bulbasaurus is a medium-sized dicynodont (maximum dorsal skull length 16.0 cm) restricted to the Tropidostoma Assemblage Zone (early Lopingian) of the Beaufort Group. Bulbasaurus can be distinguished from Tropidostoma by an array of characters including the presence of a tall, sharp premaxillary ridge, large, rugose, nearly-confluent nasal bosses, a nasofrontal ridge, massive tusks, robust pterygoids, prominently twisted subtemporal bar, and absence of a distinct postfrontal. Inclusion of Bulbasaurus in a phylogenetic analysis of anomodont therapsids recovers it as a member of Geikiidae, a clade of otherwise later Permian dicynodonts such as Aulacephalodon and Pelanomodon. Bulbasaurus exhibits many of the characters typical of adult Aulacephalodon, but at substantially smaller skull size (these characters are absent in comparably-sized Aulacephalodon juveniles), suggesting that the evolution of typical geikiid morphology preceded gigantism in the clade. Bulbasaurus is the earliest known geikiid and the only member of the group known from the Tropidostoma Assemblage Zone; discovery of this taxon shortens a perplexing ghost lineage and indicates that abundant clades from the later Permian of South Africa (e.g., Geikiidae, Dicynodontoidea) may have originated as rare components of earlier Karoo assemblage zones. ï¿½ 2017 Kammerer et al.","Dicynodontia; Ghost lineage; Karoo Basin; Permian; Phylogeny; South Africa; Synapsida; Therapsida","Article; Chordata; Lopingian; nonhuman; phylogeny; scaphopod; South Africa; species extinction; Tropidostoma","Kammerer, C.F.; Museum fï¿½r Naturkunde, Leibniz-Institut fï¿½r Evolutions- und Biodiversitï¿½tsforschungGermany; email: christian.kammerer@mfn-berlin.de",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013188094

To test if the presence of runner-likesclerobionts infested the historically collected specimen of Ivoites opitzi during itslife, we used microCT to produce a three-dimensional model of the surface ofthe specimen. Our results indicate that sclerobionts grew across the outer rim(venter) on both sides of the ammonoid conch at exactly the location where thedeviation from the planispiral was recognized, and where subsequent ammonoidgrowth would likely preclude encrustation. This indicates in vivo encrustation of theI. opitzi specimen, and represents the earliest documentation of the phenomenon.Further, this suggests that non-planispiral coiling in I. opitzi was likely pathologicallyinduced and does not represent natural morphological variation in the species.Despite the observed anomalies in coiling, the specimen reached adulthood andretains important identifying morphological features, suggesting the ammonoid wasminimally impacted by encrustation in life. As such, appointing a new type specimen-as suggested by some authors-for the species is not necessary.

Capellini', Bologna, Italy","Bayesian phylogenetic methods integrating simultaneously morphological and stratigraphic information have been applied increasingly among paleontologists. Most of these studies have used Bayesian methods as an alternative to the widely-used parsimony analysis, to infer macroevolutionary patterns and relationships among species-level or higher taxa. Among recently introduced Bayesian methodologies, the Fossilized Birth-Death (FBD) model allows incorporation of hypotheses on ancestordescendant relationships in phylogenetic analyses including fossil taxa. Here, the FBD model is used to infer the relationships among an ingroup formed exclusively by fossil individuals, i.e., dipnoan tooth plates from four localities in the Ain el Guettar Formation of Tunisia. Previous analyses of this sample compared the results of phylogenetic analysis using parsimony with stratigraphic methods, inferred a high diversity (five or more genera) in the Ain el Guettar Formation, and interpreted it as an artifact inflated by depositional factors. In the analysis performed here, the uncertainty on the chronostratigraphic relationships among the specimens was included among the prior settings. The results of the analysis confirm the referral of most of the specimens to the taxa Asiatoceratodus, Equinoxiodus, Lavocatodus and Neoceratodus, but reject those to Ceratodus and Ferganoceratodus. The resulting phylogeny constrained the evolution of the Tunisian sample exclusively in the Early Cretaceous, contrasting with the previous scenario inferred by the stratigraphically-calibrated topology resulting from parsimony analysis. The phylogenetic framework also suggests that (1) the sampled localities are laterally equivalent, (2) but three localities are restricted to the youngest part of the section; both results are in agreement with previous stratigraphic analyses of these localities. The FBD model of specimen-level units provides a novel tool for phylogenetic inference among fossils but also for independent tests of stratigraphic scenarios. © 2017 Cau.","Bayesian phylogenetics; Dipnoi; Fossilized Birth-Death model; Lower Cretaceous; Morphological characters; Specimen-level analysis; Stratigraphy; Tunisia","Article; biological model; fossilized birth death model; Lower Cretaceous; morphological trait; nonhuman; paleontology; parsimony analysis; phylogeny; stratigraphy; synapomorphy; Tunisia","Cau, A.; Department of Earth, Life and Environmental Sciences, Alma Mater Studiorum, Bologna UniversityItaly; email: cauand@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014332406

However, little attention has been given to the species ever since its original 19th century description. Newly discovered material, including the most complete specimen of fossil Phocidae from the North Sea Basin, prompted the redescription of the species. Also, the type material of ""Phoca"" vitulinoides is lost. Methods: ""Phoca"" vitulinoides is redescribed. Its phylogenetic position among Phocinae is assessed through phylogenetic analysis. Dinoflagellate cyst biostratigraphy is used to determine and reassess the geological age of the species. Myological descriptions of extant taxa are used to infer muscle attachments, and basic comparative anatomy of the gross morphology and biomechanics are applied to reconstruct locomotion. Results: Detailed redescription of ""Phoca"" vitulinoides indicates relatively little affinities with the genus Phoca, but rather asks for the establishment of a new genus: Nanophoca gen. nov. Hence, ""Phoca"" vitulinoides is recombined into Nanophoca vitulinoides. This reassignment is confirmed by the phylogenetic analysis, grouping the genus Nanophoca and other extinct phocine taxa as stem phocines. Biostratigraphy and lithostratigraphy expand the known stratigraphic range of N. vitulinoides from the late Langhian to the late Serravallian. The osteological anatomy of N. vitulinoides indicates a relatively strong development of muscles used for fore flipper propulsion and increased flexibility for the hind flipper. Discussion: The extended stratigraphic range of N. vitulinoides into the middle Miocene confirms relatively early diversification of Phocinae in the North Atlantic. Morphological features on the fore- and hindlimb of the species point toward an increased use of the fore flipper and greater flexibility of the hind flipper as compared to extant Phocinae, clearly indicating less derived locomotor strategies in this Miocene phocine species. Estimations of the overall body size indicate that N. vitulinoides is much smaller than Pusa, the smallest extant genus of Phocinae (and Phocidae), and than most extinct phocines. © 2017 Dewaele et al.","Belgium; Locomotion; Neogene; North sea basin; Phocidae; Redescription; Taxonomy","Belgium; biomechanics; biostratigraphy; body size; comparative anatomy; cyst (resting stage); hindlimb; Langhian; locomotion; muscle; new genus; nonhuman; North Sea; Phoca; phylogeny; Serravallian; species","Dewaele, L.; Department of Geology, Ghent UniversityBelgium; email: leonard.dewaele@ugent.be",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019233779

Plesiochelyidae are an important part of this first radiation of crown-group turtles into coastal marine ecosystems. Fossils of Plesiochelyidae occur in many European localities, and are especially abundant in the Kimmeridgian layers of the Swiss Jura Mountains (Solothurn and Porrentruy). In the mid-19th century, the quarries of Solothurn (NW Switzerland) already provided a large amount of fossil turtles, most notably Plesiochelys etalloni, the best-known plesiochelyid species. Recent excavations in the Porrentruy area (NW Switzerland) revealed new fossils of Plesiochelys, including numerous well-preserved shells with associated cranial and postcranial material. Methods/results: Out of 80 shells referred to Plesiochelys, 41 are assigned to a new species, Plesiochelys bigleri n. sp., including a skull-shell association.We furthermore refer 15 shells to Plesiochelys etalloni, and 24 shells to Plesiochelys sp. Anatomical comparisons show that Plesiochelys bigleri can clearly be differentiated from Plesiochelys etalloni by cranial features. The shell anatomy and the appendicular skeleton of Plesiochelys bigleri and Plesiochelys etalloni are very similar. However, a statistical analysis demonstrates that the thickness of neural bones allows to separate the two species based on incomplete material.

The clades that entered this under-filled region of ecospace might be expected to have experienced an ""adaptive radiation"": an increase in rates of morphological evolution and speciation driven by the evolution of a key innovation. However such inferences are often circumstantial, being based on the coincidence of a rate shift with the origin of an evolutionary novelty. The conclusion of an adaptive radiation may be made more robust by examining the pattern of the evolutionary shift; if the evolutionary innovation coincides not only with a shift in rates of morphological evolution, but specifically in the morphological characteristics relevant to the ecological shift of interest, then one may more plausibly infer a causal relationship between the two. Here I examine the impact of diet evolution on rates of morphological change in one of the earliest tetrapod clades to evolve high-fibre herbivory: Captorhinidae. Using a method of calculating heterogeneity in rates of discrete character change across a phylogeny, it is shown that a significant increase in rates of evolution coincides with the transition to herbivory in captorhinids. The herbivorous captorhinids also exhibit greater morphological disparity than their faunivorous relatives, indicating more rapid exploration of new regions of morphospace. As well as an increase in rates of evolution, there is a shift in the regions of the skeleton undergoing the most change; the character changes in the herbivorous lineages are concentrated in the mandible and dentition. The fact that the increase in rates of evolution coincides with increased change in characters relating to food acquisition provides stronger evidence for a causal relationship between the herbivorous diet and the radiation event.

The origin and emergence of these herpetofaunal groups are poorly understood. Aside from the better-explored European Neogene localities yielding amphibian and reptile fossil remains, the Neogene herpetofauna of Western Asia is understudied. The few available data need critical reviews and new interpretations, taking into account the more recent records of the European herpetofauna. The comparison of this previous data with that of European fossil records would provide data on palaeobiogeographic affiliations of the region as well as on the origin and emergence of the present-day fauna of Western Siberia. An overview of the earliest occurrences of certain amphibian lineages is still needed. In addition, studies that address such knowledge gaps can be useful for molecular biologists in their calibration of molecular clocks. Methods and Results: In this study, we considered critically reviewed available data from amphibian and reptile fauna from over 40 Western Siberian, Russian and Northeastern Kazakhstan localities, ranging from the Middle Miocene to Early Pleistocene. Herein, we provided new interpretations that arose from our assessment of the previously published and new data. More than 50 amphibians and reptile taxa were identified belonging to families Hynobiidae, Cryptobranchidae, Salamandridae, Palaeobatrachidae, Bombinatoridae, Pelobatidae, Hylidae, Bufonidae, Ranidae, Gekkonidae, Lacertidae, and Emydidae. Palaeobiogeographic analyses were performed for these groups and palaeoprecipitation values were estimated for 12 localities, using the bioclimatic analysis of herpetofaunal assemblages. Conclusion: The Neogene assemblage ofWestern Siberia was found to be dominated by groups of European affinities, such as Palaeobatrachidae, Bombina, Hyla, Bufo bufo, and a small part of this assemblage included Eastern Palaearctic taxa (e.g. Salamandrella, Tylototriton, Bufotes viridis). For several taxa (e.g. Mioproteus, Hyla,Bombina, Rana temporaria), the Western Siberian occurrences represented their most eastern Eurasian records. The most diverse collection of fossil remains was found in the Middle Miocene. Less diversity has been registered towards the Early Pleistocene, potentially due to the progressive cooling of the climate in the Northern Hemisphere. The results of our study showed higher-amplitude changes of precipitation development in Western Siberia from the Early Miocene to the Pliocene, than previously assumed. © 2017 Vasilyan et al.","Amphibians; Neogene; Palaeobiogeography; Palaeoclimate; Reptiles; Western Siberia","Bombina; Bufo bufo; calibration; cooling; family; fauna; fossil; Hyla; information processing; Kazakhstan; Lower Pleistocene; Middle Miocene; molecular clock; nonhuman; Northern Hemisphere; paleoclimate; Pliocene; precipitation; Rana temporaria; Russian Federation; Salamandridae; terrapin","Vasilyan, D.; Department of Geosciences, Eberhard Karls University TübingenGermany; email: davit.vasilyan@jurassica.ch",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016035749

After that transition, many mammals shifted from a crouching stance to a more upright one. It is hypothesized that one consequence of these transitions was a decrease in the total mechanical power required for locomotion, because side-to-side accelerations of the body have become smaller, and thus less costly with changes in limb orientation. To test this hypothesis we compared the kinetics of locomotion in two mammals of body size close to those of early mammals (< 40 g), both with parasagittally oriented limbs: A crouching shrew (Blarina brevicauda; 5 animals, 17 trials) and a more upright vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus; 4 animals, 22 trials). As predicted, voles used less mechanical power per unit body mass to perform steady locomotion than shrews did (P = 0.03). However, while lateral forces were indeed smaller in voles (15.6 ± 2.0% body weight) than in shrews (26.4 ± 10.9%; P = 0.046), the power used to move the body from side-to-side was negligible, making up less than 5% of total power in both shrews and voles. The most power consumed for both species was that used to accelerate the body in the direction of travel, and this was much larger for shrews than for voles (P = 0.01). We conclude that side-to-side accelerations are negligible for small mammals-whether crouching or more upright-compared to their sprawling ancestors, and that a more upright posture further decreases the cost of locomotion compared to crouching by helping to maintain the body's momentum in the direction of travel. © 2016 Riskin et al.","Anatomy; Biomechanics; Crouching; Early mammals; Force platforms; Limb posture; Mammalian evolution; Parasagittal; Posture; Sprawling; Upright","acceleration; anatomy; animal experiment; biomechanics; body posture; body size; body weight; controlled study; limb; locomotion; Microtus pennsylvanicus; nonhuman; shrew; small mammal; species; travel","Riskin, D.K.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell UniversityUnited States; email: dan.riskin@utoronto.ca",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84977079096

The most notable example compares the Equini and Hipparionini, where Equini have higher crowned teeth with less enamel-band complexity and less total occlusal enamel than Hipparionini. Whereas previous work has successfully quantified differences in enamel band shape by dividing the length of enamel band by the square root of the occlusal surface area (Occlusal Enamel Index, OEI), it was clear that OEI only partially removes the effect of body size. Because enamel band length scales allometrically, body size still has an influence on OEI, with larger individuals having relatively longer enamel bands than smaller individuals. Fractal dimensionality (D) can be scaled to any level, so we have used it to quantify occlusal enamel complexity in a way that allows us to get at an accurate representation of the relationship between complexity and body size. To test the hypothesis of tribal-level complexity differences between Equini and Hipparionini, we digitally traced a sample of 98 teeth, one tooth per individual; 31 Hipparionini and 67 Equini. We restricted our sampling to the P3-M2 to reduce the effect of tooth position. After calculating the D of these teeth with the fractal box method which uses the number of boxes of various sizes to calculate the D of a line, we performed a t -test on the individual values of D for each specimen, comparing the means between the two tribes, and a phylogenetically informed generalized least squares regression (PGLS) for each tribe with occlusal surface area as the independent variable andDas the dependent variable. The slopes of both PGLS analyses were compared using a t -test to determine if the same linear relationship existed between the two tribes. The t -test between tribes was significant (p < 0.0001), suggesting differentDpopulations for each lineage. The PGLS for Hipparionini was a positive but not significant (p=0.4912) relationship between D and occlusal surface area, but the relationship for Equini was significantly negative (p = 0.0177). λ was 0 for both tests, indicating no important phylogenetic signal is present in the relationship between these two characters, thus the PGLS collapses down to a non-phylogenetic generalized least squares (GLS) model. The t -test comparing the slopes of the regressions was not significant, indicating that the two lineages could have the same relationship between D and occlusal surface area. Our results suggest that the two tribes have the same negative relationship between D and occlusal surface area but the Hipparionini are offset to higher values than the Equini. This offset reflects the divergence between the two lineages since their last common ancestor and may have constrained their ability to respond to environmental change over the Neogene, leading to the differential survival of the Equini. © 2016 Famoso and Davis.","Body size; Equidae; Evolution; Fractal dimensionality; Occlusal enamel complexity; PGLS; Phylogenetic signal; Phylogeny; Tooth area","body size; dependent variable; enamel; environmental change; Equidae; fractal analysis; independent variable; last common ancestor; Neogene; phylogeny; quantitative study; regression analysis; sampling; statistical model; Student t test","Famoso, N.A.; Department of Geological Sciences, University of OregonUnited States; email: nfamoso2@uoregon.edu",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981528473

However, the contribution of this record to our understanding of early sauropod evolution is complicated by a dearth of information on important transitional taxa. We present a revision of the poorly known taxon Sanpasaurus yaoi Young, 1944 from the late Early Jurassic Ziliujing Formation of Sichuan Province, southwest China. Initially described as the remains of an ornithopod ornithischian, we demonstrate that the material catalogued as IVPP V156 is unambiguously referable to Sauropoda. Although represented by multiple individuals of equivocal association, Sanpasaurus is nonetheless diagnosable with respect to an autapomorphic feature of the holotypic dorsal vertebral series. Additional material thought to be collected from the type locality is tentatively referred to Sanpasaurus. If correctly attributed, a second autapomorphy is present in a referred humerus. The presence of a dorsoventrally compressed pedal ungual in Sanpasaurus is of particular interest, with taxa possessing this typically 'vulcanodontid' character exhibiting a much broader geographic distribution than previously thought. Furthermore, the association of this trait with other features of Sanpasaurus that are broadly characteristic of basal eusauropods underscores the mosaic nature of the early sauropod-eusauropod transition. Our revision of Sanpasaurus has palaeobiogeographic implications for Early Jurassic sauropods, with evidence that the group maintained a cosmopolitan Pangaean distribution. ï¿½ 2016 McPhee et al.","'Vulcanodontidae'; China; Early Jurassic; Eusauropoda; Middle Jurassic; Sauropoda","China; dinosaur; dorsal region; geographic distribution; humerus; Lower Jurassic; Middle Jurassic; nonhuman; thinking; vertebra","McPhee, B.W.; Evolutionary Studies Institute, University of the WitwatersrandSouth Africa; email: blair.mcphee@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994476679

Our geometric morphometric analysis of a 15 landmark-based configuration of platyrrhines' first and second lower molars suggest that morphological stasis may explain the reduced molar shape variation observed. Platyrrhine lower molar shape might be a primitive retention of the ancestral state affected by strong ecological constraints throughout the radiation of the main platyrrhine families.

However, such studies are mostly restricted to caviomorphs in rodents. We present here data from various families, belonging to the three main groups of rodents (Sciuroidea, Myodonta, and Ctenohystrica). The aim of this study is to define morphological indicators for the astragalus and calcaneus, which allow for inferences to be made about the locomotor behaviours in rodents. Several specimens were dissected and described to bridge the myology of the leg with the morphology of the bones of interest. Osteological characters were described, compared, mechanically interpreted, and correlated with a ""functional sequence"" comprising six categories linked to the lifestyle and locomotion (jumping, cursorial, generalist, fossorial, climber and semi-aquatic). Some character states are typical of some of these categories, especially arboreal climbers, fossorial and ""cursorial-jumping"" taxa.

In particular, we aimed to use bacterial laccase-encoding genes as molecular markers for soil organic C cycling. Using rainfed olive farming as an experimental model, we determined the stability and accumulation levels of humic substances and applied these data to bacterial laccase-encoding gene expression and diversity in soils under four different agricultural management systems (bare soils under tillage/no tillage and vegetation cover under chemical/mechanical management). Materials and Methods: Humic C (&gt; 104 Da) was subjected to isoelectric focusing. The GC-MS method was used to analyze aromatic hydrocarbons. Real-Time PCR quantification and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) for functional bacterial laccase-like multicopper oxidase (LMCO)-encoding genes and transcripts were also carried out. Results: Soils under spontaneous vegetation, eliminated in springtime using mechanical methods for more than 30 years, showed the highest humic acid levels as well as the largest bacterial population rich in laccase genes and transcripts. The structure of the bacterial community based on LMCO genes also pointed to phylogenetic differences between these soils due to the impact of different management systems. Soils where herbicides were used to eliminate spontaneous vegetation once a year and those where pre-emergence herbicides resulted in bare soils clustered together for DNA-based DGGE analysis, which indicated a certain amount of microbial selection due to the application of herbicides. When LMCOencoding gene expression was studied, soils where cover vegetation was managed either with herbicides or with mechanical methods showed less than 10% similarity, suggesting that the type of weed management strategy used can impact weed community composition and consequently laccase substrates derived from vegetation decay. Conclusions: We suggest that the low humic acid content retrieved in the herbicide-treated soils was mainly related to the type (due to vegetal cover specialization) and smaller quantity (due to lower vegetal biomass levels) of phenolic substrates for laccase enzymes involved in humification processes. We also found that spontaneous vegetal cover managed using mechanical methods could be the best option for achieving C stabilization in rainfed Mediterranean agroecosystems. © 2016 Moreno & Benitez.","Bacterial laccase; C sequestration; Cover crops; Humic acids; Litter decomposition; Olive farming","aromatic hydrocarbon; carbon; herbicide; humic acid; laccase; soil organic matter; agricultural management; Article; bacterial gene; carbon cycling; carbon storage; controlled study; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; gene expression; humic substance; isoelectric focusing; microbial diversity; no tillage; nonhuman; nucleic acid analysis; olive; real time polymerase chain reaction; soil property; tillage; vegetation dynamics","Benitez, E.; Department of Environmental Protection, CSIC-Estacion Experimental del Zaidin (EEZ)Spain; email: emilio.benitez@eez.csic.es",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981485004

Here, we present a quantitative analysis of morphological diversity in a family of small mammals, the tenrecs (Afrosoricida, Tenrecidae). Tenrecs are often cited as an example of an exceptionally morphologically diverse group. However, this assumption has not been tested quantitatively. We use geometric morphometric analyses of skull shape to test whether tenrecs are more morphologically diverse than their closest relatives, the golden moles (Afrosoricida, Chrysochloridae). Tenrecs occupy a wider range of ecological niches than golden moles so we predict that they will be more morphologically diverse. Contrary to our expectations, we find that tenrec skulls are only more morphologically diverse than golden moles when measured in lateral view. Furthermore, similarities among the species-rich Microgale tenrec genus appear to mask higher morphological diversity in the rest of the family. These results reveal new insights into the morphological diversity of tenrecs and highlight the importance of using quantitative methods to test qualitative assumptions about patterns of morphological diversity. © 2015 Finlay and Cooper.","Disparity; Geometric morphometrics; Golden moles; Morphology","Afrosoricida; ecological niche; expectation; family; genus; golden mole; quantitative analysis; relative; rest; skull; small mammal; species; tenrec","Cooper, N.; School of Natural Sciences, Trinity College DublinIreland; email: ncooper@tcd.ie",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961320563

The Cretaceous of southern Europe was characterized by an archipelago setting with faunas of mixed composition of endemic, Laurasian and Gondwanan elements. However, little is known about the relative timing of these faunal influences. The Lower Cretaceous of East-Central Europe holds a great promise for understanding the biogeographic history of Cretaceous European biotas because of the former proximity of the area to Gondwana (as part of the Apulian microcontinent). However, East-Central European vertebrates are typically poorly known fromthis time period. Here, we report on a ziphodont crocodyliform tooth discovered in the Lower Cretaceous (Albian) Alsópere Bauxite Formation of Olaszfalu, westernHungary. Methods. The morphology of the tooth is described and compared with that of other similar Cretaceous crocodyliforms. Results. Based on the triangular, slightly distally curved, constricted and labiolingually flattened crown, the small, subequal-sized true serrations on the carinae mesially and distally, the longitudinal fluting labially, and the extended shelves along the carinae lingually the tooth is most similar to some peirosaurid, non-baurusuchian sebecosuchian, and uruguaysuchid notosuchians. In addition, the paralligatorid Wannchampsus also possesses similar anterior teeth, thus the Hungarian tooth is referred here toMesoeucrocodylia indet. Discussion. Supposing a notosuchian affinity, this tooth is the earliest occurrence of the group in Europe and one of the earliest in Laurasia. In case of a paralligatorid relationship theHungarian tooth would represent their first European record, further expanding their cosmopolitan distribution. In any case, the ziphodont tooth fromthe Albian bauxite deposit of western Hungary belongs to a group still unknown from the Early Cretaceous European archipelago and therefore implies a hidden diversity of crocodyliforms in the area. © 2015 Osi et al.","Albian; Alsópere Bauxite Formation; Early Cretaceous; Hungary; Notosuchia; Paralligatoridae","bauxite; mineral; unclassified drug; anatomical concepts; Araripesuchus wegeneri; Article; Batrachomimus pastosbonensis; crocodilian; dentition; Doratodon carcharidens; geographical variation (species); Lower Cretaceous; Mahajangasuchus insignis; morphological trait; nonhuman; paleontology; species comparison; species composition; species distribution; species diversity; taxonomy; tooth; tooth crown; Trematochampsa; Carinae; Mesoeucrocodylia; Sebecosuchia; Vertebrata","Osi, A.; Department of Paleontology, Eötvös UniversityHungary; email: hungaros@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940396708

Interestingly, a few mammal species, including the silvery mole-rat Heliophobius argenteocinereus, are able to replace their dentition by the addition of supernumerary molars at the back of jaw migrating then toward the front. The aim here was to demonstrate the potential interest of further studying this rodent in order to better understand the origins of continuous dental replacement in mammals, which could also provide interesting data concerning the evolution of limited dental generation occurring in first mammals. In the present study, we described the main stages of the dental eruptive sequence in the silvery mole-rat and the associated characteristics of horizontal replacement using X-ray microtomography. This was coupled to the investigation of other African mole-rats which have no dental replacement. This method permitted to establish evidence that the initial development of the dentition in Heliophobius is comparable to what it is observed in most of African mole-rats. This rodent first has premolars, but then identical additional molars, a mechanism convergent to manatees and the pygmy rock-wallaby. Evidence of continuous replacement and strong dental dynamics were also illustrated in Heliophobius, and stressed the need to deeply investigate these aspects for evolutionary, functional and developmental purposes. We also noticed that two groups of extinct non-mammalian synapsids convergently acquired this dental mechanism, but in a way differing from extant mammals. The discussion on the diverse evolutionary origins of horizontal dental replacement put emphasis on the necessity of focusing on biological parameters potentially involved in both continuous and limited developments of teeth in mammals. In that context, the silvery mole-rat could appear as the most appropriate candidate to do so. © 2015 Gomes Rodrigues and Šumbera.","Bathyergidae; Bone remodelling; Drift; Morphology; Replacement; Resorption; Synapsids; Teeth","anatomical concepts; Article; comparative study; dentition; evolutionary developmental biology; female; Heliophobius argenteocinereus; kangaroo; micro-computed tomography; molar tooth; morphological trait; nonhuman; ontogeny; periodontal disease; phylogeny; rat; sequence homology; tooth development; Trichechus","Rodrigues, H.G.; Centre de Recherche sur la Paléobiodiversité et les Paléoenvironnements (CR2P), UMR CNRS 7207, Museum national d'Histoire naturelle, Université Paris 6France",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944899166

Comprising an almost complete tail and partial lower right hindlimb, the holotype (NMV P221080) was deposited as a carcass or body-part in a log-filled scour near the base of a deep, high-energy river that incised a faunally rich, substantially forested riverine floodplain within the Australian-Antarctic rift graben. The deposit is termed the 'Eric the Red West Sandstone.' The holotype, interpreted as an older juvenile ~1.2 m in total length, appears to have endured antemortem trauma to the pes. A referred, isolated posterior caudal vertebra (NMV P229456) from the holotype locality, suggests D. pickeringi grew to at least 2.3 m in length. D. pickeringi is characterised by 10 potential autapomorphies, among which dorsoventrally low neural arches and transversely broad caudal ribs on the anterior-most caudal vertebrae are a visually defining combination of features. These features suggest D. pickeringi had robust anterior caudal musculature and strong locomotor abilities. Another isolated anterior caudal vertebra (NMV P228342) from the same deposit, suggests that the fossil assemblage hosts at least two ornithopod taxa. D. pickeringi and two stratigraphically younger, indeterminate Eumeralla Formation ornithopods from Dinosaur Cove, NMV P185992/P185993 and NMV P186047, are closely related. However, the tail of D. pickeringi is far shorter than that of NMV P185992/P185993 and its pes more robust than that of NMV P186047. Preliminary cladistic analysis, utilising three existing datasets, failed to resolve D. pickeringi beyond a large polytomy of Ornithopoda. However, qualitative assessment of shared anatomical features suggest that the Eumeralla Formation ornithopods, South American Anabisetia saldiviai and Gasparinisaura cincosaltensis, Afro-Laurasian dryosaurids and possibly Antarctic Morrosaurus antarcticus share a close phylogenetic progenitor. Future phylogenetic analysis with improved data on Australian ornithopods will help to test these suggested affinities. © 2018 Herne et al.","Australia-Antarctica; Dinosaur; Gondwana; Ornithopod; Palaeoecology; Palaeontology; Pathology; Sedimentology; Systematics; Taphonomy","analytical parameters; Antarctica; Article; Australian; coccygeal vertebra; computer assisted tomography; cranial length; Diluvicursor pickeringi; dinosaur; fossil; nonhuman; paleontology; phylogeny; precaudal body length; river; rock; sandstone; sedimentology; taphonomy","Herne, M.C.; School of Biological Sciences, The University of QueenslandAustralia; email: ornithomatt@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040582335

Their abundance in many deposits relative to the paucity of other Triassic herbivores indicates that they were key components of Late Triassic ecosystems. However, their evolutionary relationships remain contentious due, in large part, to their extensive dermal armor, which often obstructs observation of internal skeletal anatomy and limits access to potentially informative characters. In an attempt to address this problem we reanalyzed the holotype of a recently described species of Coahomasuchus, C. chathamensis, from the Sanford sub-basin of North Carolina using computed tomography (CT). CT scans of the holotype specimen clarify preservation of the skeleton, revealing several articulated vertebrae and ribs, an isolated vertebra, left ulna, left scapula, and the right humerus, though none of the material resulted in updated phylogenetic scorings. Reexamination of aetosaur materials from the holotype locality also indicates that several isolated osteoderms and elements of the appendicular skeleton are newly referable. Based on these results, we update the Coahomasuchus chathamensis hypodigm and conduct a revised phylogenetic analysis with improved character scorings for Coahomasuchus and several other aetosaurs.

New estimates of water column processing by sponge pumping activities combined with discoveries related to carbon and nutrient cycling have led to novel hypotheses about the role of sponges in reef ecosystem function. Among these developments, a debate has emerged about the relative effects of bottom-up (food availability) and top-down (predation) control on the community of sponges on Caribbean fore-reefs. In this review, we evaluate the impact of the latest findings on the debate, as well as provide new insights based on older citations. Recent studies that employed different research methods have demonstrated that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and detritus are the principal sources of food for a growing list of sponge species, challenging the idea that the relative availability of living picoplankton is the sole proxy for sponge growth or abundance. New reports have confirmed earlier findings that reef macroalgae release labile DOC available for sponge nutrition. Evidence for topdown control of sponge community structure by fish predation is further supported by gut content studies and historical population estimates of hawksbill turtles, which likely had a much greater impact on relative sponge abundances on Caribbean reefs of the past. Implicit to investigations designed to address the bottom-up vs. topdown debate are appropriate studies of Caribbean fore-reef environments, where benthic communities are relatively homogeneous and terrestrial influences and abiotic effects are minimized. One recent study designed to test both aspects of the debate did so using experiments conducted entirely in shallow lagoonal habitats dominated by mangroves and seagrass beds. The top-down results from this study are reinterpreted as supporting past research demonstrating predator preferences for sponge species that are abundant in these lagoonal habitats, but grazed away in forereef habitats. We conclude that sponge communities on Caribbean fore-reefs of the past and present are largely structured by predation, and offer new directions for research, such as determining the environmental conditions under which sponges may be food-limited (e.g., deep sea, lagoonal habitats) and monitoring changes in sponge community structure as populations of hawksbill turtles rebound. © 2018 Pawlik et al.","Coral reefs; DOC DOM; Ecology; Ecosystem function; Food limitation; Hawksbill turtles; Historical ecology; Predation; Sponge-loop; Vicious circle","organic carbon; Agelas oroides; Article; Callyspongia vaginalis; community ecology; coral reef; intraspecific variation; Ircinia felix; Ircinia strobilina; morphology; Mycale laxissima; Niphates digitalis; nonhuman; Petrosia ficiformis; population abundance; species distribution; symbiont; total organic carbon; Verongula gigantea","Pawlik, J.R.; Department of Biology and Marine Biology, Center for Marine Science, UNCWUnited States; email: pawlikj@uncw.edu",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041318031

Regional diversity in the morphology of the H. erectus postcranium is not broadly documented, in part, because of the paucity of Asian sites preserving postcranial fossils. Yet, such an understanding of the initial hominin taxon to spread throughout multiple regions of the world is fundamental to documenting the adaptive responses to selective forces operating during this period of human evolution. Methods. The current study reports the first humeral rigidity and strength properties of East Asian H. erectus and places its diaphyseal robusticity into broader regional and temporal contexts.Weestimate true cross-sectional properties of Zhoukoudian Humerus II and quantify new diaphyseal properties of Humerus III using high resolution computed tomography. Comparative data for African H. erectus and Eurasian Late Pleistocene H. sapiens were assembled, and new data were generated from two modern Chinese populations. Results. Differences between East Asian and African H. erectus were inconsistently expressed in humeral cortical thickness. In contrast, East Asian H. erectus appears to exhibit greater humeral robusticity compared to African H. erectus when standardizing diaphyseal properties by the product of estimated body mass and humeral length. East Asian H. erectus humeri typically differed less in standardized properties from those of side-matched Late Pleistocene hominins (e.g., Neanderthals and more recent Upper Paleolithic modern humans) than did African H. erectus, and often fell in the lower range of Late Pleistocene humeral rigidity or strength properties. Discussion. Quantitative comparisons indicate that regional variability in humeral midshaft robusticity may characterize H. erectus to a greater extent than presently recognized. This may suggest a temporal difference within H. erectus, or possibly different ecogeographical trends and/or upper limb loading patterns across the taxon. Both discovery and analysis of more adult H. erectus humeri are critical to further evaluating and potentially distinguishing between these possibilities. © 2018 Xing et al.","Diaphyseal robusticity; East Asia; Hominin; Pleistocene; Upper limb","adult; article; Asia; Chinese; high resolution computer tomography; Homo neanderthalensis; human; humerus; morphology; nonhuman; Paleolithic; rigidity; taxon; thickness; upper limb; Upper Pleistocene","Xing, S.; Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origins of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of SciencesChina; email: xingsong@ivpp.ac.cn",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040860360

A modern technique to analyse shape is geometric morphometrics (GM), which offers a whole range of methods concerning the pure shape of an object. The results from these methods have provided new insights into biological problems and have become especially useful in the fields of entomology and palaeontology. Despite the conspicuous successes in other hymenopteran groups, GM analysis of wings and fossil wings of Formicidae has been neglected. Here we tested if landmarks defining the wing shape of fossil ants that belong to the genus Titanomyrma are reliable and if this technique is able to expose relationships among different groups of the largest Hymenoptera that ever lived. This study comprises 402 wings from 362 ants that were analysed and assigned with the GM methods linear discriminant function analysis, principal component analysis, canonical variate analysis, and regression. The giant ant genus Titanomyrma and the parataxon Formicium have different representatives that are all very similar but these modern methods were able to distinguish giant ant types even to the level of the sex. Thirty-five giant ant specimens from the Eckfeld Maar were significantly differentiable from a collection of Messel specimens that consisted of 187 Titanomyrma gigantea females and 42 T. gigantea males, and from 74 Titanomyrma simillima females and 21 T. simillima males. Out of the 324 Messel ants, 127 are newly assigned to a species and 223 giant ants are newly assigned to sex with GM analysis. All specimens from Messel fit to the two species. Moreover, shape affinities of these groups and the species Formicium brodiei, Formicium mirabile, and Formicium berryi, which are known only from wings, were investigated. T. gigantea stands out with a possible female relative in one of the Eckfeld specimens whereas the other groups show similar shape patterns that are possibly plesiomorphic. Formicidae are one of the most dominant taxa in the animal kingdom and new methods can aid in investigating their diversity in the present and in deep time. GM of the ant wing delivers significant results and this core of methods is able to enhance the toolset we have now to analyse the complex biology of the ants. It can prove as especially useful in the future when incorporated into better understanding aspects of evolutionary patterns and ant palaeontology. © 2018 Katzke et al.","Eckfeld; Formicidae; Formiciinae; Formicium; Fossil ants; Messel; Palaeoentomology; Palaeontology; Wing venation","ant; Article; correlation coefficient; data analysis; discriminant analysis; female; fossil; geometry; information processing; male; morphometry; nonhuman; paleontology; principal component analysis; regression analysis; sex difference; Titanomyrma; wing","Katzke, J.; Steinmann Institut für Geologie, Mineralogie und Paläontologie, Rheinische Friedrich- Wilhelms Universität BonnGermany; email: jkatzke@uni-bonn.de",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040617945

Though commonly recovered from Pleistocene sites across their range, pre- Pleistocene records of the genus are exceedingly rare. Here, we describe a new species of Gulo from the Gray Fossil Site in Tennessee. Based on biostratigraphy, a revised estimate of the age of the Gray Fossil Site is Early Pliocene, near the Hemphillian-Blancan transition, between 4.9 and 4.5 Ma. This represents the earliest known occurrence of a wolverine, more than one million years earlier than any other record. The new species of wolverine described here shares similarities with previously described species of Gulo, and with early fishers (Pekania). As the earliest records of both Gulo and Pekania are known from North America, this suggests the genus may have evolved in North America and dispersed to Eurasia later in the Pliocene. Both fauna and flora at the Gray Fossil Site are characteristic of warm/humid climates, which suggests wolverines may have become `cold-adapted' relatively recently. Finally, detailed comparison indicates Plesiogulo, which has often been suggested to be ancestral to Gulo, is not likely closely related to gulonines, and instead may represent convergence on a similar niche. © 2018 Samuels et al.","Carnivora; Guloninae; Mustelidae","article; biostratigraphy; climate; cold stress; fauna; flora; fossil; genus; Gulo gulo; information processing; new species; nonhuman; Tennessee; Zanclean","Samuels, J.X.; Department of Geosciences, East Tennessee State UniversityUnited States; email: samuelsjx@etsu.edu",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045527946

The ongoing change in climate is predicted to exert unprecedented effects on Earth's biodiversity at all levels of organization. Biological conservation is important to prevent biodiversity loss, especially for species facing a high risk of extinction. Understanding the past responses of species to climate change is helpful for revealing response mechanisms, which will contribute to the development of effective conservation strategies in the future. Methods. In this study, we modelled the distributional dynamics of a `Vulnerable' species, Pseudolarix amabilis, in response to late Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles and future 2080 climate change using an ecological niche model (MaxEnt). We also performed migration vector analysis to reveal the potential migration of the population over time. Results. Historical modelling indicates that the range dynamics of P. amabilis is highly sensitive to climate change and that its long-distance dispersal ability and potential for evolutionary adaption are limited. Compared to the current climatically suitable areas for this species, future modelling showed significant migration northward towards future potential climatically suitable areas. Discussion. In combination with the predicted future distribution, the mechanism revealed by the historical response suggests that this species will not be able to fully occupy the future expanded areas of suitable climate or adapt to the unsuitable climate across the future contraction regions.

The teeth of C. bryanti sp. nov. appear aligned with the members of the Cretalamna borealis species group, but can be distinguished from these other species by a combination of the following: anterior teeth with a more pronounced and triangular lingual root protuberance, broader triangular cusp, and a taller root relative to the height of the crown; anteriorly situated lateroposterior teeth have a distally inclined or hooked main cusp and more than one pair of lateral cusplets; and lateroposterior teeth have a strong distally hooked main cusp and a root that is largely symmetrical in basal view. At present, C. bryanti sp. nov. is stratigraphically confined to the Santonian/Campanian Dicarinella asymetrica Sigal, 1952 and Globotruncanita elevata Brotzen, 1934 Planktonic Foraminiferal Zones within the Tombigbee Sand Member of the Eutaw Formation and Mooreville Chalk, and teeth have been collected from only four counties in central and western Alabama.

Here, two postorbital horncores from the upper Foremost Formation (Campanian) of Alberta are described, and at ~78.5 Ma represent some of the geologically oldest ceratopsid material. The larger of these specimens is incorporated into a fused supraorbital complex, and preserves a massive, straight, postorbital horncore that is vertical in lateral view, but canted dorsolaterally in rostral view. Medially, the supracranial sinus is composed of a small, restricted caudal chamber, and a large rostral chamber that forms the cornual diverticulum. This morphology is distinct from that of the long-horned Chasmosaurinae, and similar to, but still different from, those of younger Centrosaurinae taxa. The smaller specimen represents an ontogenetically younger individual, and although showing consistent morphology to the larger specimen, is less taxonomically useful. Although not certain, these postorbital horns may be referable to a long-horned basal (i.e., early- branching, non-pachyrhinosaurini, non-centrosaurini) centrosaurine, potentially the contemporaneous Xenoceratops, largely known from the parietosquamosal frill.

It was preliminarily described in a brief article, but a detailed account of its osteology is emerging in recent works. The holotype is the most complete specimen yet found, so an exhaustive description of it provides much valuable anatomical information. The holotype and referred specimens preserve the axial skeleton, pectoral and pelvic girdles, and both fore- and hindlimbs. Diagnostic postcranial characters of this taxon include: anterior cervical centra exceeding the posterior limit of neural arch; eighth and ninth cervical vertebral centra with lateroventral tubercles; pneumatic foramina only in anteriormost dorsals; middle and posterior caudal centra with a complex of shallow ridges on lateral surfaces; pneumatic furcula with two pneumatic foramina on the ventral surface; scapular blade transversely expanded at mid-length; wellprojected flexor process on distal end of the humerus; dorsal rim of the ilium laterally everted; and concave dorsal rim of the postacetabular iliac blade. A paleohistological study of limb bones shows that the holotype represents an earlier ontogenetic stage than one of the referred specimens (MPCA 238), which correlates with the fusion of the last sacral vertebra to the rest of the sacrum in MPCA 238. A revised phylogenetic analysis recovered Buitreraptor as an unenlagiine dromaeosaurid, in agreement with previous works.

A single trackmaker may be associated with a range of tracks reflecting individual pedal anatomy and behavioural kinematics mediated through substrate properties which may vary both in space and time. Accordingly, the same trackmaker can leave substantially different morphotypes something which must be considered in creating ichnotaxa. In modern practice this is often captured by the collection of a series of 3D track models. We introduce two concepts to help integrate these 3D models into ichnological analysis procedures. The mediotype is based on the idea of using statistically-generated threedimensional track models (median or mean) of the type specimens to create a composite track to support formal recognition of a ichno type. Arepresentative track (mean and/or median) is created from a set of individual reference tracks or from multiple examples from one or more trackways. In contrast, stat-tracks refer to other digitally generated tracks which may explore variance. For example, they are useful in: understanding the preservation variability of a given track sample; identifying characteristics or unusual track features; or simply as a quantitative comparison tool. Both concepts assist in making ichnotaxonomical interpretations and we argue that they should become part of the standard procedure when instituting new ichnotaxa. As three-dimensional models start to become a standard in publications on vertebrate ichnology, the mediotype and stat-track concepts have the potential to help guiding a revolution in the study of vertebrate ichnology and ichnotaxonomy. © 2018 Belvedere et al.","Digital ichnology; Digital reconstruction; Ichnotaxonomy; Mediotype; Stat-track; Vertebrate ichnology","anatomy; human; kinematics; morphotype; nonhuman; publication; vertebrate","Belvedere, M.; Section d'Archéologie et Paléontologie, Paléontologie A16, Office de la Culture, Switzerland; email: matteo.belvedere@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040306554

Taxonomically assigned to numerous groups since discovery, in 1981 it was described as a stegosaur, a group of armoured ornithischian dinosaurs characterised by bizarre plates and spines extending from the neck to the tail. This assignment has been subsequently accepted. The type material consists of a premaxilla, maxilla, a nasal, and a vertebra, and contains no synapomorphies of Stegosauria. Several features of the maxilla and dentition are reminiscent of Ankylosauria, the sister-taxon to Stegosauria, and the premaxilla appears superficially similar to that of some ornithopods. The vertebral material has never been described, and since the last description of the specimen, there have been numerous discoveries of thyreophoran material potentially pertinent to establishing the taxonomic assignment of the specimen. An investigation of the taxonomic and systematic position of Paranthodon is therefore warranted. This study provides a detailed re-description, including the first description of the vertebra. Numerous phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that the systematic position of Paranthodon is highly labile and subject to change depending on which exemplifier for the clade Stegosauria is used. The results indicate that the use of a basal exemplifier may not result in the correct phylogenetic position of a taxon being recovered if the taxon displays character states more derived than those of the basal exemplifier, and we recommend the use, minimally, of one basal and one derived exemplifier per clade. Paranthodon is most robustly recovered as a stegosaur in our analyses, meaning it is one of the youngest and southernmost stegosaurs. © 2018 Raven and Maidment.","Exemplifiers; Phylogenetics; Systematics; Thyreophora","article; case report; cladistics; clinical article; dentition; dinosaur; female; human; maxilla; nonhuman; sister group; synapomorphy; vertebra","Raven, T.J.; Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College LondonUnited Kingdom; email: tom.raven13@imperial.ac.uk",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044110249

Recent studies have analysed patterns in dinosaur diversity that are based on secular variations in the numbers of published taxa. Many of these have employed a range of approaches that account for changes in the shape of the taxonomic abundance curve, which are largely dependent on databases compiled from the primary published literature. However, how these 'corrected' diversity patterns are influenced by the history of publication remains largely unknown. Here, we investigate the influence of publication history between 1991 and 2015 on our understanding of dinosaur evolution using raw diversity estimates and shareholder quorum subsampling for the three major subgroups: Ornithischia, Sauropodomorpha, and Theropoda. We find that, while sampling generally improves through time, there remain periods and regions in dinosaur evolutionary history where diversity estimates are highly volatile (e.g. the latest Jurassic of Europe, the mid-Cretaceous of North America, and the Late Cretaceous of South America). Our results show that historical changes in database compilation can often substantially influence our interpretations of dinosaur diversity. 'Global' estimates of diversity based on the fossil record are often also based on incomplete, and distinct regional signals, each subject to their own sampling history. Changes in the record of taxon abundance distribution, either through discovery of new taxa or addition of existing taxa to improve sampling evenness, are important in improving the reliability of our interpretations of dinosaur diversity. Furthermore, the number of occurrences and newly identified dinosaurs is still rapidly increasing through time, suggesting that it is entirely possible for much of what we know about dinosaurs at the present to change within the next 20 years. © 2018 Tennant et al.","Cretaceous; Dinosaurs; Diversity, Mesozoic; Extinction; Jurassic; Macroevolution; Paleobiology Database; Publication bias; Triassic","article; dinosaur; Europe; fossil; human; Jurassic; nonhuman; North America; publishing; reliability; sampling; South America; taxon; Triassic; Upper Cretaceous","Tennant, J.P.; Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College LondonUnited Kingdom; email: jon.tennant.2@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042361499

Using CT scans and 3D digital representations, we digitally reconstruct the bones of the facial skeleton, braincase, and palate of a complete, undistorted cranium of M. carinatus (BP/1/5241). We describe the anatomical features of the cranial bones, and compare them to other closely related sauropodomorph taxa such as Plateosaurus erlenbergiensis, Lufengosaurus huenei, Sarahsaurus aurifontanalis and Efraasia minor. We identify a suite of character states of the skull and braincase for M. carinatus that sets it apart from other taxa, but these remain tentative due to the lack of comparative sauropodomorph braincase descriptions in the literature. Furthermore, we hypothesize 27 new cranial characters useful for determining relationships in non-sauropodan Sauropodomorpha, delete five pre-existing characters and revise the scores of several existing cranial characters to make more explicit homology statements.

However, modelling of fossil taxa invariably involves assumptions as a result of preservation-induced loss of information in the fossil record. To test the validity of predictions from FEA, given such assumptions, these results could be compared to independent lines of evidence for cranial mechanics. In the present study a new concept of using bone microstructure to predict stress distribution in the skull during feeding is put forward and a correlation between bone microstructure and results of computational biomechanics (FEA) is carried out. The bony framework is a product of biological optimisation; bone structure is created to meet local mechanical conditions. To test how well results from FEA correlate to cranial mechanics predicted from bone structure, the well-known temnospondyl Metoposaurus krasiejowensis was used as a model. A crucial issue to Temnospondyli is their feeding mode: did they suction feed or employ direct biting, or both? Metoposaurids have previously been characterised either as active hunters or passive bottom dwellers. In order to test the correlation between results from FEA and bone microstructure, two skulls of Metoposaurus were used, one modelled under FE analyses, while for the second one 17 dermal bone microstructure were analysed. Thus, for the first time, results predicting cranial mechanical behaviour using both methods are merged to understand the feeding strategy of Metoposaurus. Metoposaurus appears to have been an aquatic animal that exhibited a generalist feeding behaviour. This taxon may have used two foraging techniques in hunting; mainly bilateral biting and, to a lesser extent, lateral strikes. However, bone microstructure suggests that lateral biting was more frequent than suggested by Finite Element Analysis (FEA). One of the potential factors that determined its mode of life may have been water levels. During optimum water conditions, metoposaurids may have been more active ambush predators that were capable of lateral strikes of the head. The dry season required a less active mode of life when bilateral biting is particularly efficient.

Phrynocephalus is one of the most diverse and taxonomically confusing lizard genera. As a key element of Palearctic deserts, it serves as a promising model for studies of historical biogeography and formation of arid habitats in Eurasia. We used 51 samples representing 33 of 40 recognized species of Phrynocephalus covering all major areas of the genus. Molecular data included four mtDNA (COI, ND2, ND4, Cytb; 2, 703 bp) and four nuDNA protein-coding genes (RAG1, BDNF, AKAP9, NKTR; 4, 188 bp). AU-tests were implemented to test for significant differences between mtDNA- and nuDNA-based topologies. A timecalibrated phylogeny was estimated using a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock with nine fossil calibrations. We reconstructed the ancestral area of origin, biogeographic scenarios, body size, and the evolution of habitat preference. Phylogenetic analyses of nuDNA genes recovered a well-resolved and supported topology. Analyses detected significant discordance with the less-supported mtDNA genealogy. The position of Phrynocephalus mystaceus conflicted greatly between the two datasets. MtDNA introgression due to ancient hybridization best explained this result. Monophyletic Phrynocephalus contained three main clades: (I) oviparous species from south-western and Middle Asia; (II) viviparous species of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP); and (III) oviparous species of the Caspian Basin, Middle and Central Asia. Phrynocephalus originated in late Oligocene (26.9 Ma) and modern species diversified during the middle Miocene (14.8-13.5 Ma). The reconstruction of ancestral areas indicated that Phrynocephalus originated in Middle East-southern Middle Asia. Body size miniaturization likely occurred early in the history of Phrynocephalus. The common ancestor of Phrynocephalus probably preferred sandy substrates with the inclusion of clay or gravel. The time of Agaminae radiation and origin of Phrynocephalus in the late Oligocene significantly precedes the landbridge between Afro-Arabia and Eurasia in the Early Miocene. Diversification of Phrynocephalus coincides well with the mid-Miocene climatic transition when a rapid cooling of climate drove progressing aridification and the Paratethys salinity crisis. These factors likely triggered the spreading of desert habitats in Central Eurasia, which Phrynocephalus occupied. The origin of the viviparous Tibetan clade has been associated traditionally with uplifting of the QTP; however, further studies are needed to confirm this. Progressing late Miocene aridification, the decrease of the Paratethys Basin, orogenesis, and Plio-Pleistocene climate oscillations likely promoted further diversification within Phrynocephalus. We discuss Phrynocephalus taxonomy in scope of the new analyses. © 2018 Solovyeva et al.","Agamidae Asian deserts; Biogeography; Dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis; Evolution; Himalayan uplift; Mid-Miocene climate transition; Palearctic; Reptilia; Sauria; Squamata; Tectonics","Agamidae; Article; Bayes theorem; biodiversity; biogeography; climate; DNA extraction; gene sequence; genealogy; miniaturization; molecular clock; nonhuman; Phrynocephalus mystaceus; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; sequence alignment","Solovyeva, E.N.; Zoological Museum, Lomonosov Moscow State UniversityRussian Federation; email: anolis@yandex.ru",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044113186

According to our results, the largest sample of tracks from three Lower Permian sites of the Thuringian Forest, commonly referred to I. cottae, is not homogeneous but shows a clear distinction in pace length, pace angulation, apparent trunk length and toe proportions between tracks from Bromacker quarry and those from the stratigraphically older sites Birkheide and Gottlob quarry. Three Late Carboniferous trackways of Ichniotherium with relatively short pedal digit V from Haine's Farm, Ohio, and Alveley near Birmingham, United Kingdom, that have been referred to the ichnotaxa ""Baropus hainesi,"" ""Megabaropus hainesi"" and ""Ichniotherium willsi,"" respectively, share a marked outward rotation of foot imprints with respect to walking direction. Apart from this feature they are in many aspects similar to the Birkheide and Gottlob records of I. cottae. With the possible exception of the Maroon Formation (Early Permian, Colorado) sample, Early Permian Ichniotherium trackways with a relatively short pedal digit V fall into the morphological spectrum of the three well defined ""Hainesi-Willsi,"" ""Birkheide-Gottlob"" and ""Bromacker"" morphotypes. With their more obtuse pace angulations and higher body-size-normalized pace and stride lengths the Bromacker type tracks imply higher walking speeds of their trackmakers compared to all other Ichniotheriumtracks.More generally, a trend towards higher locomotion capability from the last common ancestor of all Ichniotherium producers to the last common ancestor of all ""Ichniotherium with relatively short pedal digit V"" and from the latter to the trackmakers of the mid-Early Permian Bromacker type can be deduced-with the reservation that overall sample size is relatively small, making this scenario a preliminary assessment.

Some pseudosuchian archosaurs have been reported to have these articulations as well, but few have been characterized in these taxa because of a lower abundance of complete, threedimensional pseudosuchian vertebral material in relation to dinosaurs. We describe the axial column of the large (~4-5 m) poposauroid pseudosuchian Poposaurus langstoni from the Upper Triassic of Texas (TMM Locality 31025 of the Otis Chalk localities; Dockum Group, Howard County, TX, USA). P. langstoni was originally named from pelvic girdle elements and vertebrae; here we describe newly discovered and prepared presacral vertebrae and a presacral rib from the original excavation of the holotype in the 1940s. The well-preserved vertebrae have well-defined vertebral laminae and clear hyposphene-hypantrum intervertebral articulations, character states mentioned in pseudosuchians but rarely described. The new material demonstrates variation present in the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation through the vertebral column. We compared these morphologies to other pseudosuchians with and without the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation. Based on these careful comparisons, we provide an explicit definition for the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation applicable across Archosauria. Within Pseudosuchia, we find the hyposphene-hypantrum appeared independently in the clade at least twice, but we also see the loss of these structures in clades that had them ancestrally. Furthermore, we found the presence of large body sizes (femoral lengths > ~300 mm) and the presence of the hyposphene-hypantrum is correlated in most non-crocodylomorph pseudosuchian archosaurs with a few exceptions. This result suggests that the presence of the hyposphene-hypantrum is controlled by the increases and decreases in body size and not strictly inheritance. © 2018 Stefanic and Nesbitt.","Body size; Hyposphene-hypantrum; Intervertebral articulation; Poposaurus; Vertebrae","alligator; Article; body size; cervical vertebra; crocodilian; dinosaur; intervertebral articulation; Lythrosuchus; nonhuman; paleontology; Poposaurus langstoni; pseudosuchian archosaurs","Stefanic, C.M.; Department of Geosciences, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech)United States; email: cms292@vt.edu",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041996060

During excavations, two morphotypes, one gracile and one robust, were identified in the field. Furthermore, two large-sized theropod ichnospecies (Megalosauripus transjuranicus and Jurabrontes curtedulensis) and an ornithopodlike morphotype (Morphotype II) have recently been described at these sites. Methods: The quality of morphological preservation (preservation grade), the depth of the footprint, the shape variation, and the footprint proportions (FL/footprint width (FW) ratio and mesaxony) along the trackways have been analyzed using 3D models and false-color depth maps in order to determine the exact number of small to medium-sized morphotypes present in the tracksites. Results: The study of footprints (n = 93) recovered during the excavations has made it possible to identify and characterize the two morphotypes distinguished in the field. The gracile morphotype is mainly characterized by a high FL/FW ratio, high mesaxony, low divarication angles and clear, sharp claw marks, and phalangeal pads (2-3-4). By contrast, the robust morphotype is characterized by a lower FL/FWratio, weaker mesaxony, slightly higher divarication angles and clear, sharp claw marks (when preserved), whereas the phalangeal pads are not clearly preserved although they might be present. Discussion: The analysis does not allow the two morphotypes to be associated within the same morphological continuum. Thus, they cannot be extramorphological variations of similar tracks produced by a single trackmaker. Comparison of the two morphotypes with the larger morphotypes described in the formation (M. transjuranicus, J. curtedulensis, and Morphotype II) and the spatio-temporal relationships of the trackways suggest that the smaller morphotypes cannot reliably be considered as small individuals of any of the larger morphotypes. The morphometric data of some specimens of the robust morphotype (even lower values for the length/width ratio and mesaxony) suggest that more than one ichnotaxon might be represented within the robust morphotype. The features of the gracile morphotype (cf. Kalohipus isp.) are typical of ""grallatorid"" ichnotaxa with low mesaxony whereas those of the robust morphotype (cf. Therangospodus isp. and Therangospodus? isp.) are reminiscent of Therangospodus pandemicus. This work sheds new light on combining an analysis of variations in footprint morphology through 3D models and false-color depth maps, with the study of possible ontogenetic variations and the identification of small-sized tridactyl ichnotaxa for the description of new dinosaur tracks. © 2018 Castanera et al.","Dinosaur ichnology; Kimmeridgian; Late Jurassic; Reuchenette Formation; Switzerland; Theropods",,"Castanera, D.; Bayerische Staatssammlung für Paläontologie und Geologie, GeoBioCenter, Ludwig-Maximilians-UniversitätGermany; email: dcastanera@hotmail.es",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044745465

The evolution of Trachemys, while being heavily documented with fossil representatives, is not well understood. Numerous fossils from the late Hemphillian Gray Fossil Site (GFS) in northeastern Tennessee help to elucidate its evolution. The fossil Trachemys at the GFS represent a new species. The new taxon, Trachemys haugrudi, is described, and currently represents the most thoroughly described fossil emydid species known. A phylogenetic analysis, including 31 species, focusing on the subfamily Deirochelyinae is performed that includes the new fossil species, along with numerous other modern and fossil deirochelyine species, representing the first phylogenetic analysis published that includes several fossil deirochelyines. The phylogenetic analysis, utilizing morphological evidence, provides monophyletic clades of all modern deirochelyines, including Chrysemys, Deirochelys, Pseudemys, Malaclemys, Graptemys, and Trachemys. A strict consensus tree finds the recently described fossil species Graptemys kerneri to be part of a clade of Graptemys + Malaclemys. Three fossil taxa, including one previously referred to Pseudemys (Pseudemys caelata) and two to Deirochelys (Deirochelys carri and Deirochelys floridana) are found to form a clade with modern Deirochelys reticularia reticularia, with D. floridana sister to the other members of the clade. Chrysemys is found to be part of a basal polytomy with Deirochelys in relation to other deirochelyine taxa. Two fossil taxa previously referred to Chrysemys (Chrysemys timida and Chrysemys williamsi) form a paraphyly with the modern Chrysemys picta picta and Deirochelys, and may be referable to distinct genera. Additionally, fossil taxa previously attributed to Trachemys (Trachemys hillii, Trachemys idahoensis, Trachemys inflata, and Trachemys platymarginata) and T. haugrudi are found to form a clade separate from clades of northern and southern Trachemys species, potentially suggesting a distinct lineage of Trachemys with no modern survivors. Hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships mostly agree between the present study and previous ones, although the inclusion of fossil taxa provides further clues to the evolution of parts of the Deirochelyinae. The inclusion of more fossil taxa and characters may help resolve the placement of some taxa, and further elucidate the evolution of these New World turtles. © 2018 Jasinski.","Deirochelyinae; Emydidae; Fossil turtle; Gray Fossil Site; Hemphillian; New species; Phylogeny; Taxonomy; Tennessee; Trachemys","adult; article; cladistics; consensus; female; fossil; human; new species; nonhuman; paraphyly; survivor; taxon; Tennessee; Trachemys; Upper Miocene; Zanclean","Jasinski, S.E.; Department of Earth and Environmental Science, University of PennsylvaniaUnited States; email: jasst@sas.upenn.edu",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042055200

Emei in Sichuan Province, China, represents a rare species that is facultatively neotenic in the family Hynobiidae. Although the species has been known to science for some 40 years since its initial discovery in the late 1970s, anatomical details of its osteology remain poorly understood and developmental information is still lacking for the species. This study (1) provides a detailed osteological account of B. londongensis based on micro-CT scanning and clearing and staining of multiple specimens from the type locality; (2) provides a discussion of intraspecific variation related to life-history differences; and (3) presents a discussion on limb features related to morphological evolution of limb patterns correlative with ecological adaptation to mountain stream environments. Osteological comparisons with congeneric species has led to recognition of several diagnostic features that are unique to B. londongensis, including: vomers widely separated from one another, lacking a midline contact; presence of uncommon perichondral ossification of the ascending process of the palatoquadrate as part of the suspensorium; and presence of a prominent posterodorsal process of the scapular blade, which serves as a ligamentous insertion of the levator muscle of the scapula. In addition, some but not all neotenic individuals retain the palatine as a discrete element, indicative of its delayed absorption after sexual maturity. Postmetamorphic and neotenic individuals are strikingly different in the complexity of hyobranchial structures. Neotenes display a high degree of ossification of hyobranchial elements, tend to increase ossification of both hypobranchial I and ceratobranchial I during aging, and retain fully ossified ceratobranchial III and IV; in contrast, these elements remain entirely cartilaginous or are totally lost by resorption in postmetamorphic individuals. In addition, all postmetamorphic forms display an inverted ""T""-shaped basibranchial II, whereas neotenes show transformation from a ""fork""-shaped to the ""T""-shaped configuration after sexual maturity. B. londongensis displays a mosaic of apomorphic and plesiomorphic states in its limb ossifications: presence of a single centrale element in both the manus and pes is a derived condition in Hynobiidae and other families as well, whereas retention of a postminimus in the pes is obviously plesiomorphic within Urodela. Reduction in number of digits from five to four in the pes and possession of a cornified sheath covering the terminal phalanges are also derived features shared with some but not all mountain stream salamanders that are adapted to a similar type of environment. © 2018 Jiang et al.","Batrachuperus londongensis; Character evolution; Facultative neoteny; Hynobiid salamander; Osteology","adult; aging; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; China; evolutionary adaptation; female; intraspecific variation; life history; male; micro-computed tomography; muscle; neoteny; nonhuman; ossification; osteology; salamander; scapula; sexual maturity; staining; vomer","Gao, K.-Q.; School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking UniversityChina; email: kqgao@pku.edu.cn",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044566966

A new specimen (the 12th skeletal specimen) from the earliest Tithonian Painten Formation of Schamhaupten (Bavaria) represents the so far oldest representative of the genus. The new specimen shows several interesting anatomical details, including the presence of a postorbital in contact with the jugal, the presence of a separate prefrontal and coronoid, and opisthocoelous mid-cervical vertebrae. Based on observations on the new specimen, we discuss several problematic issues concerning Archaeopteryx, including the monophyly and diagnosis of the genus, the absence/ presence of the sternum, the position of the gastralia, and variation in morphometrics and dental morphology in that genus. Based on a new diagnosis for the genus Archaeopteryx, the Berlin, Eichstätt, Solnhofen, Munich, Daiting, Thermopolis, 11th, and 12th specimens can be referred to this genus with high certainty. The Maxberg specimen is very probably also an Archaeopteryx, based on overall similarity, although none of the diagnostic characters can be evaluated with certainty. The ninth specimen ('chicken wing') might be Archaeopteryx, but cannot be referred to the genus with any certainty. In comparison with other paravians, the presence of distally thickened anterior pectoral ribs indicates that a rather large cartilagenous sternum was present in this taxon. In contrast to non-opisthopubic theropods, opisthopubic taxa, such as Archaeopteryx and many other paravians, have the posterior end of the gastral basket preserved at about half-length of the pubis, which might reflect the post-mortem collapse of enlarged abdominal air sacs in these taxa. Specimens that can be referred to Archaeopteryx show a high amount of variation, both in the morphometrics of the limb bones as well as in the dentition. In respect to the latter aspect, variation is found in tooth number, spacing, orientation, and morphology, with no two specimens showing the exact same pattern. The significance of this variation is unclear, and possible explanations reach from high intraspecific (and possibly ontogenetic and/or sexual dimorphic) variation to the possibility that the known specimens represent a 'species flock' of Archaeopteryx, possibly due to island speciation after the initial dispersal of the genus into the Solnhofen Archipelago. © 2018 Rauhut et al.","Archaeopteryx; Bird origins; Paravian anatomy; Solnhofen Archipelago; Upper Jurassic; Variation",,"Rauhut, O.W.M.; SNSB-Bayerische Staatssammlung für Palaöntologie und GeologieGermany; email: o.rauhut@lrz.uni-muenchen.de",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040990013

The new species is described from mandibular and dental remains that show a unique combination of plesiomorphic and derived characters. Specifically, it is characterized by having trenchant and prominent paraconid cusps in p3-m1, lingual cingula of p2-4 with faint crenulations, premolars and molars with vestigial metaconid, bilobed root of m2 and a genial tuberosity located under p3. Furthermore, additional material of the contemporaneous Eotaria crypta is described, providing new information on the morphology of this taxon. Both species of Eotaria represent the earliest stem otariids, reinforcing the hypothesis that the group originated in the north Eastern Pacific Region. At present, the ""Topanga"" Fm. pinniped fauna includes Eotaria citrica, Eotaria crypta, the desmatophocid Allodesmus sp., the odobenids Neotherium sp., Pelagiarctos sp. and includes the oldest records of crown pinnipeds in California. Overall this pinniped fauna is similar to the nearly contemporaneous Sharktooth Hill bonebed. However, unambiguous records of Eotaria are still missing from Sharktooth Hill. This absence may be due to taphonomic or paleoenvironmental factors. The new ""Topanga"" record presented here was integrated into an overview of the late Oligocene through early Pleistocene pinniped faunas of Southern California. The results show an overall increase in body size over time until the Pleistocene. Furthermore, desmatophocids were the largest pinnipeds during the middle Miocene, but were extinct by the beginning of the late Miocene. Odobenids diversified and became the dominant pinnipeds in late Miocene through Pleistocene assemblages, usually approaching or exceeding 3 m in body length, while otariids remained as the smallest taxa. This pattern contrasts with modern assemblages, in which the phocid Mirounga angustirostris is the largest pinniped taxon in the region, odobenids are extinct and medium and small size ranges are occupied by otariids or other phocids. © 2017 Velez-Juarbe.","California; Miocene; Otariidae; Phylogenetic systematics; Pinnipedia; Taxonomy","body height; body size; Burdigalian; California; Chattian; cladistics; fauna; information processing; Langhian; Lower Pleistocene; mandible; Mirounga angustirostris; morphology; new species; nonhuman; Otariidae; premolar tooth; synapomorphy; taxon; tongue; Upper Miocene; walrus","Velez-Juarbe, J.; Department of Mammalogy, Natural History Museum of Los Angeles CountyUnited States; email: jvelezjuar@nhm.org",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013663375

Helopanoplia distincta is an extinct soft-shelled turtle (Pan- Trionychidae) for which the type specimen is a fragmentary costal and the inguinal notch portion of the left hypoplastron from the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) Lance Formation of Wyoming, USA that bear a distinct surface sculpture pattern consisting of raised tubercles. Over the course of the past few decades, a number of additional, fragmentary specimens from the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) Hell Creek Formation of Montana and North Dakota have been referred to this taxon based on the presence of these tubercles, but a more complete understanding of the anatomy and phylogenetic relationships of this distinctive soft-shelled turtle is still outstanding. Methods. We here figure and describe shell remains of eight fossils referable to Helopanoplia distincta from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana and North Dakota that, in combination, document nearly all aspects of the shell morphology of this taxon. We furthermore explore the relationships of this fossil turtle by inserting it into a modified phylogenetic analysis of pan-trionychid relationships. Results. The new fossil material thoroughly supports the validity of Helopanoplia distincta. In addition to its unique surface sculpture pattern, this turtle can be diagnosed relative to all other named pan-trionychids by the presence of a distinct corner along the margin of costals II, the complete covering of costal ribs I-VI by metaplastic bone, midline contact of the main plastral elements, hyoplastral shoulder, presence of a lateral, upturned margin on the hyo/hypoplastron that is covered dorsally and laterally by sculptured metaplastic bone, a single, lateral hyoplastral process, and the apomorphic presence of fine scallops along the margin of costals VIII, formation of a laterally embraced, rounded nuchal, anteriorly rounded costals I, distally expanded costals II, and narrow costals VII. A phylogenetic analysis places Helopanoplia distincta as sister to the clade formed by Plastomenus thomasii and Hutchemys spp., thereby confirming its identity as a plastomenid. The vast majority of Helopanoplia distincta material has been recovered from fine-grained overbank deposits, thereby supporting the hypothesis that this turtle favored ponded waters. © 2017 Joyce and Lyson.","Cryptodira; Hell Creek Formation; Helopanoplia distincta; Lance Formation; Late Cretaceous; Maastrichtian; Plastomenidae; Testudines; Trionychidae","anatomical variation; animal shell; art; Article; disarticulation; fossil; Helopanoplia distincta; hyoplastron; hypoplastron; intraspecific variation; morphology; nonhuman; ossification; paleontology; phylogeny; rib; taxonomy; turtle; xiphiplastron","Joyce, W.G.; Departement für Geowissenschaften, Universität FreiburgSwitzerland; email: walter.joyce@unifr.ch",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038033850

The phylogenetic relationships within Mosasauroidea, however, have experienced only little changes throughout the last decades. Considering the substantial improvements in the development of phylogenetic methodology that have undergone in recent years, resulting, among others, in numerous alterations in the phylogenetic hypotheses of other fossil amniotes, we test the robustness in our understanding of mosasauroid beginnings and their evolutionary history. We re-examined a data set that results from modifications assembled in the course of the last 20 years and performed multiple parsimony analyses and Bayesian tip-dating analysis. Following the inferred topologies and the 'weak spots' in the phylogeny of mosasauroids, we revise the nomenclature of the 'traditionally' recognized mosasauroid clades, to acknowledge the overall weakness among branches and the alternative topologies suggested previously, and discuss several factors that might have an impact on the differing phylogenetic hypotheses and their statistical support. © 2017 Madzia and Cau.","Bayesian inference; Fossilized birth-death model; Late Cretaceous; Mosasauroidea; Parsimony analysis; Phylogenetic nomenclature; Phylogeny","amniote; Article; Bayes theorem; bootstrapping; evolutionary adaptation; fossil; freshwater environment; lizard; monophyly; morphological trait; Mosasauroidea; nonhuman; paraphyly; parsimony analysis; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; stratigraphy; synapomorphy; taxonomy; Upper Cretaceous","Madzia, D.; Institute of Paleobiology, Polish Academy of SciencesPoland; email: daniel.madzia@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029472611

Macelognathus vagans Marsh, 1884 from the Late Jurassic Morrison Fm. of Wyoming was originally described as a dinosaur by Marsh and in 1971 Ostrom suggested crocodilian affinities. In 2005, Gï¿½hlich and collaborators identified new material of this species from Colorado as a basal crocodylomorph. However, a partial skull found in association with mandibular and postcranial remains was not described. Methods. Due to the small size and delicate structures within the braincase, micro CT studies were performed on this specimen. The new anatomical information was incorporated in a phylogenetic dataset, expanding both character and taxon sampling. Results. This new material reinforces the non-crocodyliform crocodylomorph affinities of Macelognathus as it bears a large otic aperture, unfused frontals and lacks ornamentation on the dorsal cranial bones. The internal structures also support these affinities as this specimen bears traits (i.e., heavily pneumatized and expanded basisphenoid; the presence of additional pneumatic features on the braincase; and the otoccipitalquadrate contact) not present in most basal crocodylomorphs. Furthermore, the presence of a wide supraoccipital and a cranioquadrate passage are traits shared with Almadasuchus from the early Late Jurassic of Argentina. Macelognathus was recovered as one of the closest relatives of crocodyliforms, forming a clade (Hallopodidae) with two other Late Jurassic taxa (Almadasuchus and Hallopus). Discussion. The clade formed by Almadasuchus C Hallopus C Macelognathus, the Hallopodidae, is characterized by a higher degree of suturing of the braincase, posteriorly closed otic aperture (paralleled in mesoeucrocodylians) and cursorial adaptations. Also, the phylogenetic position of this lineage of derived crocodylomorphs as the sister group of Crocodyliformes implies a large amount of unsampled record (ghost lineage), at least 50 million years. ï¿½ 2017 Leardi et al.","Braincase; Crocodylomorpha; Late jurassic; Micro CT; Phylogeny","anatomy; archosaur; Argentina; bear; cladistics; dorsal region; human; human tissue; mandible; marsh; micro-computed tomography; nonhuman; parietal bone; relative; sampling; sister group; Upper Jurassic","Leardi, J.M.; CONICET, Instituto de Estudios Andinos 'Don Pablo Groeber' (IDEAN), Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Departamento de Ciencias Geolï¿½gicas, Universidad de Buenos AiresArgentina; email: jmleardi@gl.fcen.uba.ar",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013187664

They include two specimens of a whaitsiid, Microwhaitsia mendrezi gen. et sp. nov., and a single, small whaitsioid Ophidostoma tatarinovi gen. et sp. nov., which preserves a combination of primitive and apomorphic features. A phylogenetic analysis of 56 therapsid taxa and 136 craniodental and postcranial characters places the new taxa within the monophyletic sister group of baurioids-Whaitsioidea-with Microwhaitsia as a basal whaitsiid and Ophidostoma as an aberrant whaitsioid just outside the hofmeyriid+whaitsiid subclade. The new records support that whaitsioids were diverse during the early-late Permian (Wuchiapingian) and that the dichotomy between whaitsiid-line and baurioid-line eutherocephalians was established early on. The oldest Gondwanan whaitsiid Microwhaitsia and additional records from the lower strata of the Teekloof Formation suggest that whaitsioids had diversified by the early Wuchiapingian and no later than Pristerognathus Assemblage Zone times. Prior extinction estimates based on species counts are reflected in an analysis of origination/extinction rates, which imply increasing faunal turnover from Guadalupian to Lopingian (late Permian) times. The new records support a growing body of evidence that some key Lopingian synapsid clades originated near or prior to the Guadalupian-Lopingian boundary ca. 260-259 million years ago, but only radiated following the end-Guadalupian extinction of dinocephalians and basal therocephalian predators (long-fuse model). Ongoing collecting in older portions of the Teekloof Formation (e.g., Pristerognathus Assemblage Zone) will shed further light on early eutherocephalians during this murky but critical time in their evolutionary diversification. © 2017 Huttenlocker and Smith.","Extinction; Permian; Synapsid; Tetrapod; Therocephalians","cladistics; female; Guadalupian; information processing; new species; nonhuman; predator; sister group; South Africa; tetrapod; turnover time; Wuchiapingian","Huttenlocker, A.K.; Department of Integrative Anatomical Sciences, University of Southern CaliforniaUnited States; email: huttenlo@usc.edu",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030679831

The holotype of Borealopelta, a new nodosaurid ankylosaur, preserves osteoderms and extensive epidermal structures (dark organic residues), in anatomic position across the entire precaudal length. Contrasting previous specimens, organic epiosteodermal scales, often in the form of horn-like (keratinous) sheaths, cap and exaggerate nearly all osteoderms, allowing for morphometric and allometric analyses of both the bony osteoderms and their horny sheaths. A total of 172 osteoderms were quantified, with osteoderm spine length and height being positively allometric with respect to basal length and width. Despite tight correlations between the different measures amongst all other osteoderms, the large parascapular spines represent consistent outliers. Thickness and relative contribution of the keratinized epiosteodermal scales/sheaths varies greatly by region, ranging from 2% to 6% for posterior thoracics, to ~25% (1.3×) for the parascapular spines-similar to horn sheaths in some bovid analogues. Relative to the bony cores, the horny portions of the spines are strongly positively allometric (slope = 2.3, CI = 1.8-2.8). Strong allometric scaling, species-specific morphology, and significant keratinous extension of the cervicoscapular spines is consistent with elaboration under socio-sexual selection.

A tooth and elements of the axial skeleton, and the scapular and pelvic girdle, represent it. It is one of the most complete titanosauriform sauropods from the Early Cretaceous of Europe and presents an opportunity to deepen our understanding of the radiation of this clade in the Early Cretaceous and study the paleobiogeographical relationships of Iberia with Gondwana and with other parts of Laurasia. The late Barremian-early Aptian is the time interval in the Cretaceous with the greatest diversity of sauropod taxa described in Iberia: two titanosauriforms, Tastavinsaurus and Europatitan; and a rebbachisaurid, Demandasaurus. The new sauropod Europatitan eastwoodi n. gen. n. sp. presents a series of autapomorphic characters in the presacral vertebrae and scapula that distinguish it from the other sauropods of the Early Cretaceous of Iberia. Our phylogenetic study locates Europatitan as the basalmost member of the Somphospondyli, clearly differentiated from other clades such as Brachiosauridae and Titanosauria, and distantly related to the contemporaneous Tastavinsaurus. Europatitan could be a representative of a Eurogondwanan fauna like Demandasaurus, the other sauropod described from the Castrillo de la Reina Formation.

This has been augmented in the last 20 years by rarer permineralized material showing cellular preservation. Here, we describe a new genus of anatomically preserved gymnosperm seed from the Callovian-Oxfordian (Jurassic) Oxford Clay Formation (UK), using a combination of traditional sectioning and synchrotron radiation X-ray micro-tomography (SRXMT). Oxfordiana motturii gen. et sp. nov. is large and bilaterally symmetrical. It has prominent external ribs, and has a threelayered integument comprising: a narrow outer layer of thick walled cells; a thick middle parenchymatous layer; and innermost a thin fleshy layer. The integument has a longitudinal interior groove and micropyle, enveloping a nucellus with a small pollen chamber. The large size, bilateral symmetry and integumentary groove demonstrate an affinity for the new species within the cycads.Moreover, the internal groove in extant taxa is an autapomorphy of the genus Cycas, where it facilitates seed germination. Based upon the unique seed germination mechanism shared with living species of the Cycadaceae, we conclude that O. motturii is a member of the stem-group lineage leading to Cycas after the Jurassic divergence of the Cycadaceae from other extant cycads. SRXMT-for the first time successfully applied to fossils already prepared as slides-reveals the distribution of different mineral phases within the fossil, and allows us to evaluate the taphonomy of Oxfordiana. An early pyrite phase replicates the external surfaces of individual cells, a later carbonate component infilling void spaces. The resulting taphonomic model suggests that the relatively small size of the fossils was key to their exceptional preservation, concentrating sulfate-reducing bacteria in a locally closed microenvironment and thus facilitating soft-tissue permineralization. © 2017 Spencer et al.","3D Reconstruction; Cycad; Cycadeospermum; Cycas; Fossil; Gymnosperm; Ovule; Oxford Clay Formation; Palaeobotany; Taphonomy",,"Spencer, A.R.T.; Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College LondonUnited Kingdom; email: alan.spencer@imperial.ac.uk",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028432530

GMM reveals previously undetected sexdifferential shape allometry and sex-related shape differences that are size independent (i.e., associated to the y-intercept, and not to size scaling). Sexual shape dimorphism affects both the relative carapace-to-opisthosoma size and the carapace geometry, arguably resulting from sex differences in both reproductive roles (female egg load and male competition) and life styles (wandering males and burrowing females).

Here we describe new cranial remains (above all, an almost complete right premaxilla and a caudally incomplete left dentary) that greatly improve our knowledge on this enigmatic species and reveal its anatomy to be crocodylomorph. The right premaxilla indicates that the rostrum was deep, wide, and not pointed; it bears five teeth that are sub-vertical and just slightly curved lingually; the mesial teeth are U-shaped in cross-section and have serrated carinae on the lingual side; the aperturae nasi osseae (external bony nares) are confluent and face rostrally; and there is no lateral groove at the premaxillomaxillary suture for reception of a hypertrophied lower caniniform tooth. The preserved portion of the left dentary has an edentulous tip and bears eight large mandibular teeth of which the mesial (1-3) are the largest, but none is a hypertrophied caniniform tooth; the mandibular (dentary) symphysis extends caudally to the level of the third tooth; the splenial is not preserved, but its sutural marks on the dentary indicate that it contributed to the mandibular symphysis for at least 20% of the symphyseal length in dorsal aspect. On the basis of this new data, some previously uncertain features of the holotype maxilla-such as the margin of the suborbital fenestra, the contact surfaces for the palatine, the ectopterygoid, and the jugal-are now apparent. Testing of the phylogenetic position of the species within Crocodylomorpha indicates that R. sakalavae is a mesoeucrocodylian. It also represents one of the earliest events of exacerbated increase in body size along the evolutionary history of the group. In addition, it is by far the oldest notosuchian. A cranial reconstruction of this gigantic predator is also attempted here. The very robust jaw bones of R. sakalavae, coupled with its peculiar dentition, strongly suggest a diet that included hard tissue such as bone and tendon. © 2017 Dal Sasso et al.","Cranial anatomy; Madagascar; Mesoeucrocodylia; Middle jurassic; Notosuchia; Pachydont dentition","Article; body size; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; gigantism; hard palate; lung alveolus; Madagascar; nonhuman; parsimony analysis; phylogeny; synapomorphy","Sasso, C.D.; Museo di Storia Naturale di MilanoItaly; email: cdalsasso@yahoo.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021769145

Terrestrial habitus has been inferred for these distinctive predators. A direct morphological signal for locomotion can be expected in the postcrania, particularly the pelvic and pectoral girdles. Here we describe fossil materials of the girdles, which chart their morphological variation in the subfamily from Eocene through to Middle Miocene. Over this period, both girdles undergo significant morphological changes. Notably, an enclosed, ventrally orientated acetabulum in the ilium is developed in one lineage. This recapitulates the erect parasagittal configuration of the pelvic limb seen in many Mesozoic crocodylomorph lineages, suggesting consistent use of erect high-walking in these mekosuchines. Other pelves from the same Oligo-Miocene deposits display morphology closer to modern crocodilians, suggesting a partitioning of locomotory strategy among sympatric meko-suchines. Plesiomorphic and derived pelvic girdles are distinguishable by parsimony analysis, and the earliest examples of the mekosuchine pelvis more closely resemble gavialids and alligatorids while latter forms converge on crown group crocodylids in the morphology of the iliac crest. This suggests that a revaluation of the base relationship of Mekosuchinae within Eusuchia is necessary. © 2017 Stein et al.","Australia; Crocodile; Erect high-walking; Evolution; Mekosuchinae; Morphological radiation; Oligo-miocene; Paleoecology; Pelvic and pectoral girdles; Pillar-erect locomotion","acetabulum; Australia; crocodile; Eocene; fossil; iliac bone; iliac crest; Mesozoic; Middle Miocene; morphology; nonhuman; paleoecology; parsimony analysis; radiation; walking","Stein, M.D.; PANGEA Research Centre, School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of New South WalesAustralia; email: michael.stein@student.unsw.edu.au",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021658535

Numerous specimens of currently 15 accepted species belonging to ten genera have been reported from the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous of North and South America, Europe, and Africa. The highest diversity is known from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of the western United States: a recent review recognized 12 valid, named species, and possibly three additional, yet unnamed ones. One of these is herein described in detail and referred to the genus Galeamopus. The holotype specimen of Galeamopus pabsti sp. nov., SMA 0011, is represented by material from all body parts but the tail, and was found at the Howe-Scott Quarry in the northern Bighorn Basin in Wyoming, USA. Autapomorphic features of the new species include a horizontal canal on the maxilla that connects the posterior margin of the preantorbital and the ventral margin of the antorbital fenestrae, a vertical midline groove marking the sagittal nuchal crest, the presence of a large foramen connecting the postzygapophyseal centrodiapophyseal fossa and the spinopostzygapophyseal fossa of mid- and posterior cervical vertebrae, a very robust humerus, a laterally placed, rugose tubercle on the concave proximal portion of the anterior surface of the humerus, a relatively stout radius, the absence of a distinct ambiens process on the pubis, and a distinctly concave posteroventral margin of the ascending process of the astragalus. In addition to the holotype specimen SMA 0011, the skull USNM 2673 can also be referred to Galeamopus pabsti. Histology shows that the type specimen SMA 0011 is sexually mature, although neurocentral closure was not completed at the time of death. Because SMA 0011 has highly pneumatized cervical vertebrae, the development of the lamination appears a more important indicator for individual age than neurocentral fusion patterns. SMA 0011 is one of very few sauropod specimens that preserves the cervico-dorsal transition in both vertebrae and ribs. The association of ribs with their respective vertebrae shows that the transition between cervical and dorsal vertebrae is significantly different in Galeamopus pabsti than in Diplodocus carnegii or Apatosaurus louisae, being represented by a considerable shortening of the centra from the last cervical to the first dorsal vertebra. Diplodocids show a surprisingly high diversity in the Morrison Formation. This can possibly be explained by a combination of geographical and temporal segregation, and niche partitioning. © 2017 Tschopp and Mateus.","Dinosauria; Diplodocinae; Howe Ranch; Late Jurassic; Morrison formation; New species; Ontogeny; Sauropoda","Article; biobank; carpal bone; cervical vertebra; coracoid process; dinosaur; femur; fibula; forelimb; Galeamopus pabsti; genetic variability; hindlimb; humeral head; iliac bone; ischium; mandible; maxilla; nonhuman; occipital bone; orbital cortex; osteology; paleontology; phylogeny; population dynamics; pterygoid muscle; radius; rib; skeleton; skull; sphenoid; talus","Tschopp, E.; Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra, Università di TorinoItaly; email: tschopp.e@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018964944

However, ecological interactions between the species that inhabited these ecosystems, such as predator-prey relationships or interspecific competition, are poorly known. To this regard, carnivore marks imprinted on the fossil bones of megamammal remains are very useful for deciphering biological activity and, hence, potential interspecific relationships among taxa. In this article, we study historical fossil collections housed in different European and Argentinean museums that were excavated during the 19th and early 20th centuries in the Pampean region, Argentina, in order to detect carnivore marks on bones of megamammals and provide crucial information on the ecological relationships between South American taxa during the Pleistocene. Our results indicate that the long bones of megafauna from the Pampean region (e.g., the Mylodontidae and Toxodontidae families) exhibit carnivore marks. Furthermore, long bones of medium-sized species and indeterminate bones also present punctures, pits, scores and fractures. Members of the large-carnivore guild, such as ursids, canids and even felids, are recognised as the main agents that inflicted the marks. We hypothesize that the analysed carnivore marks represent the last stages of megaherbivore carcass exploitation, suggesting full consumption of these animals by the same or multiple taxa in a hunting and/or scavenging scenario. Moreover, our observations provide novel insights that help further our understanding of the palaeoecological relationships of these unique communities of megamammals. © 2017 Chichkoyan et al.","Bone marks; Carnivore; Interaction; Megamammal; Pampean region; Pleistocene; Quaternary","Article; biological activity; body size; carnivore; epiphysis; fossil; humerus; long bone; mammal; nonhuman; organismal interaction; scoring system","Figueirido, B.; Departmento de Ecología y Geología, Facultad de Ciencias, Universdad de MálagaSpain; email: Borja.figueirido@uma.es",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018747174

Although many species of this genus have been described, these species are defined based on very fragmentary specimens. Propalaeocastor irtyshensis from the Early Oligocene Irtysh River Formation in northwestern Xinjiang, China is one of the earliestknown members of Propalaeocastor. This species is defined on a single maxillary fragment. We revise the diagnosis of P. irtyshensis and the genus Propalaeocastor, based on newly discovered specimens from the Irtysh River Formation. The dental morphology of P. irtyshensis is very similar to other early castorids. The caudal palatine foramen of P. irtyshensis is situated in the maxillary-palatine suture. This is a feature generally accept as diagnostic character for the castorids. On the other hand, P. irtyshensis has two upper premolars, a rudimentarily developed sciuromorph-like zygomatic plate, and a relatively large protrogomorph-like infraorbital foramen. Some previous researchers suggested that Propalaeocastor is a junior synonym of Steneofiber, while other took it as a valid genus. Our morphological comparison and phylogenetic analysis suggest that Propalaeocastor differs from Steneofiber and is a valid genus. We also suggest that Agnotocastor aubekerovi, A. coloradensis, A. galushai, A. readingi, Oligotheriomys primus, and ""Steneofiber aff. dehmi"" should be referred to Propalaeocastor.

The prompt disarticulation of the dermo-skeletal elements due to taphonomic processes and the lack of a wellossified endoskeleton in a large number of groups hinder the preservation of complete specimens. Previous reconstructions of most early vertebrates known from partial remains have been wholly based on phylogenetically closely related taxa. However, body design of fishes is determined, to a large extent, by their swimming mode and feeding niche, making it possible to recognise different morphological traits that have evolved several times in non-closely related groups with similar lifestyles. Based on this well-known ecomorphological correlation, here we propose a useful comparative framework established on extant taxa for predicting some anatomical aspects in extinct aquatic vertebrates from palaeoecological data and vice versa. For this, we have assessed the relationship between the locomotory patterns and the morphological variability of the caudal region in extant sharks by means of geometric morphometrics and allometric regression analysis. Multivariate analyses reveal a strong morphological convergence in non-closely related shark species that share similar modes of life, enabling the characterization of the caudal fin morphology of different ecological subgroups. In addition, interspecific positive allometry, affecting mainly the caudal fin span, has been detected. This phenomenon seems to be stronger in sharks with more pelagic habits, supporting its role as a compensation mechanism for the loss of hydrodynamic lift associated with the increase in body size, as previously suggested for many other living and extinct aquatic vertebrates. The quantification of shape change per unit size in each ecological subgroup has allowed us to establish a basis for inferring not only qualitative aspects of the caudal fin morphology of extinct early vertebrates but also to predict absolute values of other variables such as the fin span or the hypocercal and heterocercal angles. The application of this ecomorphological approach to the specific case of Dunkleosteus terrelli has led to a new reconstruction of this emblematic placoderm. Our proposal suggests a caudal fin with a well-developed ventral lobe, narrow peduncle and wide span, in contrast to classical reconstructions founded on the phylogenetic proximity with much smaller placoderms known from complete specimens. Interestingly, this prediction gains support with the recent discovery of fin distal elements (ceratotrichia) in a well preserved D. terrelli, which suggests a possible greater morphological variability in placoderm caudal fins than previously thought. © 2017 Ferrón et al.","Caudal fin; Dunkleosteus terrelli; Early vertebrates; Ecomorphology; Geometric morphometrics; Palaeoart; Sharks; Size","allometry; body size; caudal fin; compensation; feeding; habit; hydrodynamics; lifestyle; morphological trait; morphometry; multivariate analysis; nonhuman; prediction; regression analysis; shark; swimming; thinking","Ferrón, H.G.; Cavanilles Institute of Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology, University of ValenciaSpain; email: Humberto.Ferron@uv.es",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037103815

Passerines (Aves: Passeriformes) dominate modern terrestrial bird communities yet their fossil record is limited. Liang Bua is a large cave on the Indonesian island of Flores that preserves Late Pleistocene-Holocene deposits (~190 ka to present day). Birds are the most diverse faunal group at Liang Bua and are present throughout the stratigraphic sequence. Methods. We examined avian remains from the Late Pleistocene deposits of Sector XII, a 2 × 2 m area excavated to about 8.5 m depth. Although postcranial passerine remains are typically challenging to identify, we found several humeral characters particularly useful in discriminating between groups, and identified 89 skeletal elements of passerines. Results. At least eight species from eight families are represented, including the Largebilled Crow (Corvus cf. macrorhynchos), the Australasian Bushlark (Mirafra javanica), a friarbird (Philemon sp.), and the Pechora Pipit (Anthus cf. gustavi). Discussion. These remains constitute the first sample of fossil passerines described in Wallacea. Two of the taxa no longer occur on Flores today; a large sturnid (cf. Acridotheres) and a grassbird (Megalurus sp.). Palaeoecologically, the songbird assemblage suggests open grassland and tall forests, which is consistent with conditions inferred from the non-passerine fauna at the site. Corvus cf. macrorhynchos, found in the Homo floresiensis-bearing layers, was likely part of a scavenging guild that fed on carcasses of Stegodon florensis insularis alongside vultures (Trigonoceps sp.), giant storks (Leptoptilos robustus), komodo dragons (Varanus komodoensis), and probably H. floresiensis as well. © 2017 Meijer et al.","Aves; Avifauna; Passeriformes; Passerines; Southeast Asia; Wallacea","carcass; controlled study; Corvus; family; fauna; forest; fossil; grassland; Indonesia; nonhuman; starling; Upper Pleistocene; vulture (bird)","Meijer, H.J.M.; University Museum of Bergen, Department of Natural History, University of BergenNorway; email: Hanneke.Meijer@uib.no",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027501340

Egg color serves several ecological purposes, including post-mating signaling and camouflage. Egg camouflage represents a major character of open-nesting birds which accomplish protection of their unhatched offspring against visually oriented predators by cryptic egg coloration. Cryptic coloration evolved to match the predominant shades of color found in the nesting environment. Such a selection pressure for the evolution of colored or cryptic eggs should be present in all open nesting birds and relatives. Many birds are open-nesting, but protect their eggs by continuous brooding, and thus exhibit no or minimal eggshell pigmentation. Their closest extant relatives, crocodiles, protect their eggs by burial and have unpigmented eggs. This phylogenetic pattern led to the assumption that colored eggs evolved within crown birds. The mosaic evolution of supposedly avian traits in non-avian theropod dinosaurs, however, such as the supposed evolution of partially open nesting behavior in oviraptorids, argues against this long-established theory. Using a double-checking liquid chromatography ESI-Q-TOF mass spectrometry routine, we traced the origin of colored eggs to their non-avian dinosaur ancestors by providing the first record of the avian eggshell pigments protoporphyrin and biliverdin in the eggshells of Late Cretaceous oviraptorid dinosaurs. The eggshell parataxon Macroolithus yaotunensis can be assigned to the oviraptor Heyuannia huangi based on exceptionally preserved, late developmental stage embryo remains. The analyzed eggshells are from three Late Cretaceous fluvial deposits ranging from eastern to southernmost China. Reevaluation of these taphonomic settings, and a consideration of patterns in the porosity of completely preserved eggs support an at least partially open nesting behavior for oviraptorosaurs. Such a nest arrangement corresponds with our reconstruction of blue-green eggs for oviraptors. According to the sexual signaling hypothesis, the reconstructed blue-green eggs support the origin of previously hypothesized avian paternal care in oviraptorid dinosaurs. Preserved dinosaur egg color not only pushes the current limits of the vertebrate molecular and associated soft tissue fossil record, but also provides a perspective on the potential application of this unexplored paleontological resource. © 2017 Wiemann et al.","Biliverdin; Dinosaur paternal care; Egg color evolution; Eggshell taphonomy; Macroolithus yaotunensis; Protoporphyrin; Reproduction",,"Wiemann, J.; Division of Palaeontology, Steinmann Institute of Geology, Mineralogy and Palaeontology, University of BonnGermany; email: jasmina.wiemann@yale.edu",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028458240

Analysis of molecular data can potentially improve species delimitations because they are easily generated and independent, and yield consistent results with high statistical power. We used classical phylogenetic (maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference) and coalescentbased methods (divergence dating with fossil calibrations and coalescent-based species delimitation) to resolve the phylogeny of the spiny lobster Panulirus homarus subspecies complex in the Indo-West Pacific. Analyses of mitochondrial data and combined nuclear and mitochondrial data recovered Panulirus homarus homarus and Panulirus homarus rubellus as separately evolving lineages, while the nuclear data trees were unresolved. Divergence dating analysis also identified Panulirus homarus homarus and Panulirus homarus rubellus as two distinct clades which diverged froma common ancestor during the Oligocene, approximately 26 million years ago. Species delimitation using coalescent-based methods corroborated these findings. A long pelagic larval life stage and the influence of ocean currents on post-larval settlement patterns suggest that a parapatric mode of speciation drives evolution in this subspecies complex.

These are among the oldest known cases of three-dimensional preservation of these organs in vertebrates and shed light on the ecology of this salamander. Indeed, the digestive tract contains remains of a frog, which represents the only known case of an extinct salamander that fed on a frog, an extremely rare type of predation in extant salamanders.

In this paper, we propose a new method, named the intervals' method, to analyse data from finite element models in a comparative multivariate framework. As a case study, several armadillo mandibles are analysed, showing that the proposed method is useful to distinguish and characterise biomechanical differences related to diet/ecomorphology. Methods. The intervals' method consists of generating a set of variables, each one defined by an interval of stress values. Each variable is expressed as a percentage of the area of the mandible occupied by those stress values. Afterwards these newly generated variables can be analysed using multivariate methods. Results. Applying this novel method to the biological case study of whether armadillo mandibles differ according to dietary groups, we show that the intervals' method is a powerful tool to characterize biomechanical performance and how this relates to different diets. This allows us to positively discriminate between specialist and generalist species. Discussion.

Those occurred within a continuum between more sprawling and erect modes of locomotion and involved drastic changes of limb anatomy and function in several lineages, including sauropodomorph dinosaurs. We present biomechanical computer models of two locomotor extremes within Archosauria in an analysis of joint ranges of motion and the moment arms of the major forelimb muscles in order to quantify biomechanical differences between more sprawling, pseudosuchian (represented the crocodile Crocodylus johnstoni) and more erect, dinosaurian (represented by the sauropodomorph Mussaurus patagonicus) modes of forelimb function. We compare these two locomotor extremes in terms of the reconstructed musculoskeletal anatomy, ranges of motion of the forelimb joints and the moment arm patterns of muscles across those ranges of joint motion. We reconstructed the threedimensional paths of 30 muscles acting around the shoulder, elbow and wrist joints. We explicitly evaluate how forelimb joint mobility and muscle actions may have changed with postural and anatomical alterations from basal archosaurs to early sauropodomorphs. We thus evaluate in which ways forelimb posture was correlated with muscle leverage, and how such differences fit into a broader evolutionary context (i.e. transition from sprawling quadrupedalism to erect bipedalism and then shifting to graviportal quadrupedalism). Our analysis reveals major differences of muscle actions between the more sprawling and erect models at the shoulder joint. These differences are related not only to the articular surfaces but also to the orientation of the scapula, in which extension/flexion movements in Crocodylus (e.g. protraction of the humerus) correspond to elevation/depression in Mussaurus. Muscle action is highly influenced by limb posture, more so than morphology. Habitual quadrupedalism in Mussaurus is not supported by our analysis of joint range of motion, which indicates that glenohumeral protraction was severely restricted. Additionally, some active pronation of the manus may have been possible in Mussaurus, allowing semi-pronation by a rearranging of the whole antebrachium (not the radius against the ulna, as previously thought) via long-axis rotation at the elbow joint. However, the muscles acting around this joint to actively pronate it may have been too weak to drive or maintain such orientations as opposed to a neutral position in between pronation and supination. Regardless, the origin of quadrupedalism in Sauropoda is not only linked to manus pronation but also to multiple shifts of forelimb morphology, allowing greater flexion movements of the glenohumeral joint and a more columnar forelimb posture. © 2017 Otero et al.","Biomechanics; Bipedalism; Crocodylia; Dinosauria; Moment arm; Musculoskeletal model; Posture; Pronation; Quadrupedalism; Range of motion","anatomy; biomechanics; body position; controlled study; Crocodylus johnsoni; dinosaur; elbow; forearm; forelimb; humerus; joint function; joint mobility; morphology; muscle function; nonhuman; pronation; range of motion; scapula; supination; thinking; ulna","Otero, A.; División Paleontología de Vertebrados, Museo de la PlataArgentina; email: alexandros.otero@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035015669

However, this record is mostly Pliocene and younger, with most of the Miocene history of the clade remaining practically unknown. The earliest recognized balaenid is the early Miocene Morenocetus parvus Cabrera, 1926 from Argentina. M. parvus was originally briefly described from two incomplete crania, a mandible and some cervical vertebrae collected from the lower Miocene Gaiman Formation of Patagonia. Since then it has not been revised, thus remaining a frequently cited yet enigmatic fossil cetacean with great potential for shedding light on the early history of crown Mysticeti. Here we provide a detailed morphological description of this taxon and revisit its phylogenetic position. The phylogenetic analysis recovered the middle Miocene Peripolocetus as the earliest diverging balaenid, and Morenocetus as the sister taxon of all other balaenids. The analysis of cranial and periotic morphology of Morenocetus suggest that some of the specialized morphological traits of modern balaenids were acquired by the early Miocene and have remained essentially unchanged up to the present. Throughout balaenid evolution, morphological changes in skull arching and ventral displacement of the orbits appear to be coupled and functionally linked to mitigating a reduction of the field of vision. The body length ofMorenocetus and other extinct balaenids was estimated and the evolution of body size in Balaenidae was reconstructed. Optimization of body length on our phylogeny of Balaenidae suggests that the primitive condition was a relatively small body length represented by Morenocetus, and that gigantism has been acquired independently at least twice (in Balaena mysticetus and Eubalaena spp.), with the earliest occurrence of this trait in the late Miocene-early Pliocene as represented by Eubalaena shinshuensis. © 2017 Buono et al.","Balaenidae; Evolution; Mysticeti; Neogene; Patagonia","collagen; Argentina; Article; Balaenidae; baleen whale; biological trait; body height; body size; bone length; bone mass; bone maturation; cervical vertebra; Cetacea; cranial nerve; cranial suture; Eubalaena; Eubalaena australis; evolution; foramen magnum; gas analysis; geography; maturity; Miocene; Morenocetus parvus; nonhuman; nose cavity; parsimony analysis; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; skull; snout; temporal bone","Buono, M.R.; Instituto Patagónico de Geología y Paleontología, CCT CONICET-CENPATArgentina; email: buono@cenpat-conicet.gob.ar",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038890748

Unlike typical Jurassic bone deposits, it is dominated by the presence of Allosaurus fragilis. Since excavation began in the 1920s, numerous hypotheses have been put forward to explain the taphonomy of CLDQ, including a predator trap, a drought assemblage, and a poison spring. In an effort to reconcile the various interpretations of the quarry and reach a consensus on the depositional history of CLDQ, new data is required to develop a robust taphonomic framework congruent with all available data. Here we present two new data sets that aid in the development of such a robust taphonomic framework for CLDQ. First, x-ray fluorescence of CLDQ sediments indicate elevated barite and sulfide minerals relative to other sediments from the Morrison Formation in the region, suggesting an ephemeral environment dominated by periods of hypereutrophic conditions during bone accumulation. Second, the degree of abrasion and hydraulic equivalency of small bone fragments dispersed throughout the matrix were analyzed from CLDQ. Results of these analyses suggest that bone fragments are autochthonous or parautochthonous and are derived from bones deposited in the assemblage rather than transported. The variability in abrasion exhibited by the fragments is most parsimoniously explained by local periodic re-working and re-deposition during seasonal fluctuations throughout the duration of the quarry assemblage. Collectively, these data support previous interpretations that the CLDQ represents an attritional assemblage in a poorly-drained overbank deposit where vertebrate remains were introduced post-mortem to an ephemeral pond during flood conditions. Furthermore, while the elevated heavy metals detected at the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry are not likely the primary driver for the accumulation of carcasses, they are likely the result of multiple sources; some metals may be derived from post-depositional and diagenetic processes, and others are potentially produced from an abundance of decomposing vertebrate carcasses. These new data help to support the inferred depositional environment of the quarry as an ephemeral pond, and represent a significant step in understanding the taphonomy of the bonebed and Late Jurassic paleoecology in this region. © 2017 Peterson et al.","Bonebed; Geochemistry; Morrison; Paleoecology","barium sulfate; calcium carbonate; graphite; silicon dioxide; sulfide; Article; bone density; bone mineralization; dinosaur; geochemistry; information processing; Jurassic; paleoecology; paleontology; stratigraphy; taphonomy; X ray fluorescence","Peterson, J.E.; Department of Geology, University of Wisconsin-OshkoshUnited States; email: petersoj@uwosh.edu",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020177559

Therefore, each new discovery of a fossil mesoveliid is of high interest, giving new insight into their early evolutionary history and diversity and enabling the testing of their proposed relationships. Here, we report the discovery of new mesoveliid material from Spanish Lower Cretaceous (Albian) amber, which is the first such find in Spanish amber. To date, fossil records of this family only include one species from French Kimmeridgian as compression fossils, two species in French amber (Albian-Cenomanian boundary), and one in Dominican amber (Miocene). The discovery of two males and one female described and figured as Glaesivelia pulcherrima Sánchez-García & Solórzano Kraemer gen. et sp. n., and a single female described and figured as Iberovelia quisquilia Sánchez-García & Nel, gen. et sp. n., reveals novel combinations of traits related to some genera currently in the subfamily Mesoveliinae. Brief comments about challenges facing the study of fossil mesoveliids are provided, showing the necessity for a revision of the existing phylogenetic hypotheses. Some of the specimens were studied using infrared microscopy, a promising alternative to the systematic study of organisms preserved in amber that cannot be clearly visualised. The new taxa significantly expand the fossil record of the family and shed new light on its palaeoecology. The fossils indicate that Mesoveliidae were certainly diverse by the Cretaceous and that numerous tiny cryptic species living in humid terrestrial to marginal aquatic habitats remain to be discovered. Furthermore, the finding of several specimens as syninclusions suggests aggregative behaviour, thereby representing the earliest documented evidence of such ethology. © 2017 Sánchez-García et al.","Heteroptera; Infrared microscopy; Litter amber; Paleoecology; Paleoethology; Spain","abdomen; Albian; allotype; antenna (organ); Article; Cenomanian; Crustacea; Cryptovelia; female; genital system; hair; Hemiptera; Iberovelia quisquilia; Latin glaesum; male; Mesoveliidae; metatarsal bone; microscopy; Miocene; morphological trait; nomenclature; nonhuman; paleoecology; pondweed bug; snout; stereomicroscopy; swamp; thorax; trichobothria","Solórzano Kraemer, M.M.; Paläontologie und Historische Geologie, Sektion Paläozoologie I, Senckenberg Forschungsinstitut und NaturmuseumGermany; email: monica.solorzanokraemer@senckenberg.de",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028993313

Despite these peculiarities, the systematics, phylogeny and feeding habits of this taxon have not been properly studied. In this paper, we describe a new species of the genus, Mourasuchus pattersoni sp. nov., from the late Miocene of the Urumaco Formation of Venezuela. The new species differs from the other Mourasuchus species in having a lateromedially wide, dorsoventrally high jugal bone and a circular incisive foramen, which both represent autapomorphies of the new taxon. Phylogenetically, M. pattersoni sp. nov. is more closely related to M. amazonensis and the specimen UFAC-1424 (formely attributed to M. nativus) than to M. arendsi or M. atopus, whilst Mourasuchus is recovered once more as a monophyletic group. Furthermore, the cladistic analysis performed in this contribution offers a new phylogenetic assessment of Caimaninae, including many taxa described recently for the group. In this study, we also discuss the crocodylian diversity of the Urumaco Formation as well as how paleoenvironment may have contributed toward its evolution. In addition, we provide a discussion of the potential feeding habits of Mourasuchus. In this contribution, Mourasuchus is regarded as a taxon that likely preferred to prey on small animals. The unusual skull morphology of this group may have evolved to cover a large area with the rostrum, allowing for a more efficient prey capture, while the prey may have consisted predominantly of large amounts of small animals. © 2017 Cidade et al.","Alligatoroidea; Caimaninae; Feeding behaviour; Miocene; Mourasuchus; Mourasuchus pattersoni; Paleoecology; Phylogeny; South America","cladistics; crocodilian; feeding behavior; genus; monophyly; morphology; new species; nonhuman; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; skull; taxon; Upper Miocene; Venezuela","Cidade, G.M.; Departamento de Biologia, FFCLRP, Universidade de São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil; email: giovannecidade@hotmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014731790

Despite their widespread taxonomic occurrence and similar external morphology to marginal teeth, it has not been rigorously tested whether denticles are structurally homologous to true teeth with features such as a pulp cavity, dentine, and enamel, or if they are bony, tooth-like protrusions. Additionally, the denticles are known to occur not only on the palatal bones but also on a mosaic of small palatal plates that is thought to have covered the interpterygoid vacuities of temnospondyls through implantation in a soft tissue covering; however, these plates have never been examined beyond a simple description of their position and external morphology. Accordingly, we performed a histological analysis of these denticulate palatal plates in a dissorophoid temnospondyl in order to characterize their microanatomy and histology. The dentition on these palatal plates has been found to be homologous with true teeth on the basis of both external morphology and histological data through the identification of features such as enamel and a pulp cavity surrounded by dentine. In addition, patterns of tooth replacement and ankylosis support the hypothesis of structural homology between these tiny teeth on the palatal plates and the much larger marginal dentition. We also provide the first histological characterization of the palatal plates, including documentation of abundant Sharpey's fibres that provide a direct line of evidence to support the hypothesis of soft tissue implantation.

In particular, incremental lines in dentin have been used to determine tooth growth and replacement rates in several dinosaurian clades. However, to date, few studies have investigated the dental microstructure of theropods in the omnivory/her- bivory spectrum. Here we examine dental histology of Therizinosauria, a clade of large-bodied theropods bearing significant morphological evidence for herbivory, by examining the teeth of the early-diverging therizinosaurian Falcarius utahensis, and an isolated tooth referred to Suzhousaurus megatherioides, a highly specialized large-bodied representative. Despite attaining some of the largest body masses among maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs, therizinosaurian teeth are diminutive, measuring no more than 0.90 cm in crown height (CH) and 0.38 cm in crown base length (CBL). Comparisons with other theropods and non-theropodan herbivorous dinosaurs reveals that when controlling for estimated body mass, crown volume in therizinosaurians plots most closely with dinosaurs of similar dietary strategy as opposed to phylogenetic heritage. Analysis of incremental growth lines in dentin, observed in thin sections of therizinosaurian teeth, demonstrates that tooth growth rates fall within the range of other archosaurs, conforming to hypothesized physiological limitations on the production of dental tissues. Despite dietary differences between therizinosaurians and hypercarnivorous theropods, the types of enamel crystallites present and their spatial distribution-i.e., the schmelzmuster of both taxa-is limited to parallel enamel crystal- lites, the simplest form of enamel and the plesiomorphic condition for Theropoda. This finding supports previous hypotheses that dental microstructure is strongly influenced by phylogeny, yet equally supports suggestions of reduced reliance on oral processing in omnivorous/herbivorous theropods rather than the microstructural specializations to diet exhibited by non-theropodan herbivorous dinosaurs. Finally, although our sample is limited, we document a significant reduction in the rate of enamel apposition contrasted with increased relative enamel thickness between early and later diverging therizinosaurians that coincides with anatomical evidence for increased specializations to herbivory in the clade. © 2017 Button et al.","Dentin; Dinosaur teeth; Enamel microstructure; Histology; Therizinosauria; Tooth growth; Von ebner","Article; crown base length; crown height; dinosaur; Falcarius utahensis; histology; medical parameters; nonhuman; phylogeny; plesiomorphy; Suzhousaurus megatherioides; therizinosaurian dental tissue; tooth development; tooth length; tooth tissue","Button, K.; Department of Biological Sciences, North Carolina State UniversityUnited States; email: kabutton@ncsu.edu",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037702310

Previous quantitative studies on Bauruemys elegans (Suárez, 1969) shell variation, as well as the taphonomic interpretation of its type locality, have suggested that all specimens collected in this locality may have belonged to the same population. We rely on this hypothesis in a morphometric study of the skull. Also, we tentatively assessed the eating preference habits differentiation that might be explained as due to ontogenetic changes. Methods. We carried out an ANOVA testing 29 linear measurements from 21 skulls of B. elegans taken by using a caliper and through images, using the ImageJ software. First, a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was performed with 27 measurements (excluding total length and width characters; =raw data) in order to visualize the scatter plots based on the form variance only. Then, a second PCA was carried out using ratios of length and width of each original measurement to assess shape variation among individuals. Finally, original measurements were log-transformed to describe allometries over ontogeny. Results. No statistical differences were found between caliper and ImageJ measurements. The first three PCs of the PCA with raw data comprised 70.2% of the variance. PC1 was related to size variation and all others related to shape variation. Two specimens plotted outside the 95% ellipse in PC1~PC2 axes. The first three PCs of the PCA with ratios comprised 64% of the variance. When considering PC1~PC2, all specimens plotted inside the 95% ellipse. In allometric analysis, five measurements were positively allometric, 19 were negatively allometric and three represented enantiometric allometry. Many bones of the posterior and the lateral emarginations lengthen due to increasing size, while jugal and the quadratojugal decrease in width. Discussion. ImageJ is useful in replacing caliper since there was no statistical differences. Yet iterative imputation is more appropriate to deal with missing data in PCA. Some specimens show small differences in form and shape. Form differences were interpreted as occuring due to ontogeny, whereas shape differences are related to feeding changes during growth. Moreover, all outlier specimens are crushed and/or distorted, thus the form/shape differences may be partially due to taphonomy. The allometric lengthening of the parietal, quadrate, squamosal, maxilla, associated with the narrowing of jugal and quadratojugal may be related to changes in feeding habit between different stages of development. This change in shape might represent a progressive skull stretching and enlargement of posterior and lateral emargination during ontogeny, and consequently, the increment of the feeding-apparatus musculature. Smaller individuals may have fed on softer diet, whereas larger ones probably have had a harder diet, as seen in some living species of Podocnemis. We conclude that the skull variation might be related to differences in feeding habits over ontogeny in B. elegans. © 2017 Mariani and Romano.","Bauru group; Feeding habits; Missing data; Morphometry; Ontogeny; Pelomedusoides; Principal components analysis; Testudines","allometry; animal shell; Article; case study; feeding; fossil; infratemporal fossa; intraspecific variation; morphometry; nonhuman; ontogeny; principal component analysis; sex difference; skull; taphonomy; turtle; vertebrate","Mariani, T.F.; Deparatamento de Biologia Animal, Universidade Federal de ViçosaBrazil; email: tmariani.bio@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017342016

The entire holotype and a few bones attributed to the paratype formed the basis of the original description by Taquet (1976). A mounted skeleton that appears to correspond to O. nigeriensis has been on public display since 1975, exhibited at the Natural History Museum of Venice. It was never explicitly reported whether the Venice specimen represents a paratype and therefore, the second nearly complete skeleton reported in literature or a third unreported skeleton. The purpose of this paper is to disentangle the complex history of the various skeletal remains that have been attributed to Ouranosaurus nigeriensis (aided by an unpublished field map of the paratype) and to describe in detail the osteology of the Venice skeleton. The latter includes the paratype material (found in 1970 and collected in 1972), with the exception of the left femur, the right coracoid and one manus ungual phalanx I, which were replaced with plaster copies, and (possibly) other manus phalanges. Some other elements (e.g., the first two chevrons, the right femur, the right tibia, two dorsal vertebrae and some pelvic bones) were likely added from other individual/s. The vertebral column of the paratype was articulated and provides a better reference for the vertebral count of this taxon than the holotype. Several anatomical differences are observed between the holotype and the Venice specimen. Most of them can be ascribed to intraspecific variability (individual or ontogenetic), but some are probably caused by mistakes in the preparation or assemblage of the skeletal elements in both specimens. The body length of the Venice skeleton is about 90% the linear size of the holotype. Osteohistological analysis (the first for this taxon) of some long bones, a rib and a dorsal neural spine reveals that the Venice specimen is a sub-adult; this conclusion is supported by somatic evidence of immaturity. The dorsal `sail' formed by the elongated neural spines of the dorsal, sacral and proximal caudal vertebrae characterizes this taxon among ornithopods; a display role is considered to be the most probable function for this bizarre structure. Compared to the mid-1970s, new information from the Venice specimen and many iguanodontian taxa known today allowed for an improved diagnosis of O. nigeriensis. © 2017 Bertozzo et al.","Cretaceous; Dinosauria; Gadoufaoua; Gondwana; Ornithopoda; Ouranosaurus nigeriensis; Styracosterna","adult; body height; body remains; coccygeal vertebra; coracoid process; Cretaceous; diagnosis; dinosaur; dorsal region; error; femur; nonhuman; osteology; pelvic girdle; phalanx; rib; sacral spinal cord; structure activity relation; subadult; taxon; tibia","Bertozzo, F.; Earth System Science-AMGC, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Pleinlaan 2, Belgium; email: filippo.bertozzo@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021112046

Larvae show no squamation but a progressive appearance of cartilaginous neurocranial and vertebral elements, and appendicular elements, whereas juveniles progress in terms of ossification and squamation. The presence of cartilaginous and bony tissues, discriminated on histological and chemical signatures, shows a progressive mineralisation of neurocranial and vertebral elements.

The family Pontoporiidae (Cetacea, Odontoceti, Inioidea) is currently represented in our oceans by just one species of diminutive dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei, franciscana). Although P. blainvillei is limited to coastal waters of the South Atlantic along Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, multiple Miocene and Pliocene fossils indicate the past presence of members of the family in the South Atlantic, South Paciifc and North Atlantic oceans. Our comprehension of the origin and diversity of this clade and of the relationships of its members with other inioids is hampered by the fact that part of the described fossil specimens, especially from the North Atlantic realm, are cranial fragments often associated to limited stratigraphic information. Methods. Based on an almost complete fossil cranium of pontoporiid from the Westerschelde estuary, The Netherlands, whose preservation allows for detailed morphological observations, we describe a new genus and species. The latter is compared to other pontoporiids, as well as a few non-pontoporiid inioids. A phylogenetic analysis is performed to investigate the relationship of S. vandokkumi with the best-known extinct and extant inioids. Palynological analysis of the sediment associated to the holotype is used to assess its geological age. Results and discussion. The new genus and species Scaldiporia vandokkumi is characterized among others by greatly thickened premaxillary eminences reaching the level of the antorbital notch. Palynologically dated from the late Tortonian-earliest Zanclean (7.6-5 Ma, Late Miocene-earliest Pliocene), this new pontoporiid confirms the surprising past diversity of marine inioids in the North Atlantic area. Finally the content of the pontoporiid subfamily Brachydelphininae is briefly discussed. © 2017 Post et al.","Cetacea; Earliest Pliocene; Inioidea; Late Miocene; Pontoporiidae; The Netherlands; Westerschelde","cladistics; comprehension; estuary; fossil; Netherlands; new genus; nonhuman; phylogeny; sediment; skull; toothed whale; Tortonian; Zanclean","Post, K.; Natuurhistorisch Museum RotterdamNetherlands; email: klaaspost@fishcon.nl",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032747801

These marine carnivores bear notable raptorial appendages for smashing or spearing prey. We investigated the evolutionary relationships among stomatopods using phylogenetic analyses of three mitochondrial and two nuclear markers. Our analyses recovered the superfamily Gonodactyloidea as polyphyletic, with Hemisquilla as the sister group to all other extant stomatopods. A relaxed molecular clock, calibrated by seven fossil-based age constraints, was used to date the origin and major diversification events of stomatopods. Our estimates suggest that crown-group stomatopods (Unipeltata) diverged from their closest crustacean relatives about 340 Ma (95% CRI [401-313 Ma]). We found that the specialized smashing appendage arose after the spearing appendage ~126 Ma (95% CRI [174-87 Ma]). Ancestral state reconstructions revealed that the most recent common ancestor of extant stomatopods had eyes with six midband rows of hexagonal ommatidia. Hexagonal ommatidia are interpreted as plesiomorphic in stomatopods, and this is consistent with the malacostracan ground-plan. Our study provides insight into the evolutionary timescale and systematics of Stomatopoda, although further work is required to resolve with confidence the phylogenetic relationships among its superfamilies. © 2017 Van Der Wal et al.","Ancestral state reconstruction; Fossil calibration; Molecular clock; Phylogenetic analysis; Stomatopoda","calibration; eye; female; fossil; human; Malacostraca; mitochondrion; molecular clock; nonhuman; relative; sister group; taxonomy","Van Der Wal, C.; School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of SydneyAustralia; email: cara.vanderwal@sydney.edu.au",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029688048

Plankton is not only a major part of the modern marine ecosystem, but must have played an important role in the ecosystems of the past as well. Unfortunately, our knowledge about plankton composition of the past is still quite limited. As an important part of today's zooplankton, malacostracan larvae are still a rarity in the fossil record; many types of malacostracan larvae dominating the modern plankton have so far not been found as fossils. Here we report a new type of fossil malacostracan larva, found in the 150 million years old lithographic limestones of southern Germany (Solnhofen Lithographic Limestones). The three rather incomplete specimens mainly preserve the telson. A pronounced middle spine on the posterior edge of these specimens indicates that they are either larval forms of a clawed lobster or of an axiidean lobster, or of a closer relative to one of the two groups. The tergo-pleura are drawn out into distinct spines in one specimen, further supporting the interpretation as a larva of a clawed lobster or an early relative. The telson morphology also shows adaptations to a prolonged planktic life style, the latero-posterior edges are drawn out into distinct spines. Similar adaptations are known in larvae of the modern homarid lobster Nephrops norvegicus, not necessarily indicating a closer relationship, but convergent life styles. The new finds provide an important new insight into the composition of Mesozoic zooplankton and demonstrate the preservation potential of lithographic limestones. ï¿½ 2017 Haug and Haug.","Homarida; Nephropida; Solnhofen; Upper jurassic; Zoea","fossil; Germany; larva; lifestyle; morphology; Nephropidae; nonhuman; pleura; spine; Upper Jurassic; zooplankton","Haug, J.T.; Department of Biology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitï¿½t Mï¿½nchenGermany; email: joachim.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013158316

Lepidosaurs, a group including rhynchocephalians and squamates, are one of the major clades of extant vertebrates. Although there has been extensive phylogenetic work on this clade, its interrelationships are a matter of debate. Morphological and molecular data suggest very different relationships within squamates. Despite this, relatively few studies have assessed the utility of other types of data for inferring squamate phylogeny. Methods. We used developmental sequences of 20 events in 29 species of lepidosaurs. These sequences were analysed using event-pairing and continuous analysis. They were transformed into cladistic characters and analysed in TNT. Ancestral state reconstructions were performed on two main phylogenetic hypotheses of squamates (morphological and molecular). Results. Cladistic analyses conducted using characters generated by these methods do not resemble any previously published phylogeny. Ancestral state reconstructions are equally consistent with both morphological and molecular hypotheses of squamate phylogeny. Only several inferred heterochronic events are common to all methods and phylogenies. Discussion. Results of the cladistic analyses, and the fact that reconstructions of heterochronic events show more similarities between certain methods rather than phylogenetic hypotheses, suggest that phylogenetic signal is at best weak in the studied developmental events. Possibly the developmental sequences analysed here evolve too quickly to recover deep divergences within Squamata. © 2017 Skawiński and Borczyk.","Evo-devo; Heterochrony; Morphology vs molecules; Phylogeny; Squamates; Systematics","cladistics; evolutionary developmental biology; intermethod comparison; morphology; nonhuman; phylogeny; species; squamate","Skawiński, T.; Department of Evolutionary Biology and Conservation of Vertebrates, University of WroclawPoland; email: tomasz.skawinski@o2.pl",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018278145

Since their initial discovery, they have prompted difficulty in taxonomic assignments and number of valid species. Past revisions have only examined a handful of genera, while recent advances in cladistic and morphometric analyses have granted us additional avenues to answering questions regarding our understanding of valid nimravid taxa and their phylogenetic relationships. To resolve issues of specific validity, the phylogenetic species concept (PSC) was utilized to maintain consistency in diagnosing valid species, while simultaneously employing character and linear morphometric analyses for confirming the validity of taxa. Determined valid species and taxonomically informative characters were then employed in two differential cladistic analyses to create competing hypotheses of interspecific relationships. The results suggest the validity of twelve species and six monophyletic genera. The first in depth reviews of Pogonodon and Dinictis returned two valid species (P. platycopis, P. davisi) for the former, while only one for the latter (D. felina). The taxonomic validity of Nanosmilus is upheld.

The largely Mississippian strata of the Kilpatrick Hills, located at the western end of the Scottish Midland Valley, enclose several macrofossil floras that together contain ca 21 organ-species of permineralised plants and ca 44 organ-species of compressed plants, here estimated to represent 25 whole-plant species (Glenarbuck = nine, Loch Humphrey Burn Lower = 11, Upper = seven). The most significant locality is the internationally important volcanigenic sequence that is reputedly intercalated within the Clyde Plateau Lava Formation at Loch Humphrey Burn, where ca 30 m of reworked tuffs and other clastic sediments enclose one of the world's most important terrestrial lagerstätten of this period. We here explore the palaeoecology and palaeoenvironments of the locality, and elucidate its controversial age. Methods. Repeated re-excavation of key exposures allowed recognition of five main depositional units, differing in thickness from 4 m to 12 m. It also permitted detailed sampling for plant macrofossils and microfossils throughout the succession. Several approaches are integrated to re-assess the taphonomy and preservation of these exceptional plant fossils. Key Results. The deposits are rich in taxonomically diverse miospores and in toto contain at least six well-developed compression floras, together with two beds yielding nodules that enclose well-researched anatomically preserved plants permineralised in calcite. Bulk geochemistry shows that the upper nodules formed by migration of Ca with subordinate Mn and Na. Some phylogenetically important plant fossils recovered in the early 20th century have been traced to their source horizons. Trends in relative proportions of macrofossil and microfossil taxa through the sequence are only moderately congruent, perhaps reflecting the likelihood that microfossils sample the regional rather than the local flora. Conclusions. The Loch Humphrey Burn sequence encompasses a wide range of depositional environments that intercalates high-energy fluvial channels (possibly developed during flash floods in a seasonally arid environment) with lower energy flood plains and a brief lacustrine interval; all yield macrofloras typically dominated by allochthonous pteridosperms. The uppermost unit represents clastic swamps dominated by (hypo)autochthonous lycopsids and ferns s.l., and is tentatively correlated with the entire-reputedly mid-Visean-exposure at nearby Glenarbuck. Other nearby localities with rooted tree-lycopsids appear to have immediately pre-dated the onset of regional volcanism. These interpretations allow revised provenancing and dating of historical collections of key plant fossils. The late Tournaisian date previously attributed on palynological evidence to the lowest unit at Loch Humphrey Burn appears increasingly improbable when our re-appraisal of the macrofloras and microfloras is placed in the context of (a) statistical comparison with other permineralised Mississippian assemblages and (b) recent stratigraphic and geochronologic studies in the region; rather, we ascribe the entire Kilpatrick Hills sequence to the mid-Visean. Stratigraphic and palaeoenvironmental interpretations of the Mississippian rocks of the Kilpatrick Hills have especially profound implications for our understanding of the physical evolution of Scotland during the Variscan orogeny and formation of Pangea. © 2016 Bateman et al.","Anatomical preservation; Bulk geochemistry; Clyde Plateau lavas; Compressions; ICP-AES; Palaeobotany; Palaeoecology; Palaeoenvironments; Palynozones; Permineralisations; Spores; Stratigraphy; Tournaisian; Tuffs; Visean","Article; community; evolution; geochemistry; gymnosperm; Humphrey perimeter; macrofossil; nonhuman; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; phylogeny; Polypodiopsida; sequence analysis; stratigraphy; taphonomy; United Kingdom; vegetative stage","Bateman, R.M.; Royal Botanic Gardens KewUnited Kingdom; email: R.Bateman@kew.org",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963984642

Important life history traits like longevity or age at maturity, which could be inferred from the analysis of these features, form the basis for estimations of demographic parameters that are essential in ecological and evolutionary studies of vertebrates. Here, we study the intraskeletal histological variability in an ontogenetic series of Asiatic wild ass (Equus hemionus) in order to assess the suitability of several skeletal elements to reconstruct the life history strategy of the species. Bone tissue types, vascular canal orientation and BGMs have been analyzed in 35 cross-sections of femur, tibia and metapodial bones of 9 individuals of different sexes, ages and habitats. Our results show that the number of BGMs recorded by the different limb bones varies within the same specimen. Our study supports that the femur is the most reliable bone for skeletochronology, as already suggested. Our findings also challenge traditional beliefs with regard to the meaning of deposition of the external fundamental system (EFS). In the Asiatic wild ass, this bone tissue is deposited some time after skeletal maturity and, in the case of the femora, coinciding with the reproductive maturity of the species.

These fossil accumulations give us a window into the island's past from 80,000 years ago to a mere few hundred years ago, recording the extinction of some groups and the persistence of others. The crocodylian subfossil record is limited to two taxa, Voay robustus and Crocodylus niloticus, found at sites distributed throughout the island. V. robustus is extinct while C. niloticus is still found on the island today, but whether these two species overlapped temporally, or if Voay was driven to extinction by competing with Crocodylus remains unknown. While their size and presumed behavior was similar to each other, nearly nothing is known about the growth and development of Voay, as the overwhelming majority of fossil specimens represent mature adult individuals. Here we describe a nearly complete juvenile crocodylian specimen from Anjohibe Cave, northwestern Madagascar. The specimen is referred to Crocodylus based on the presence of caviconchal recesses on the medial wall of the maxillae, and to C. niloticus based on the presence of an oval shaped internal choana, lack of rostral ornamentation and a long narrow snout. However, as there are currently no described juvenile specimens of Voay robustus, it is important to recognize that some of the defining characteristics of that genus may have changed through ontogeny. Elements include a nearly complete skull and many postcranial elements (cervical, thoracic, sacral, and caudal vertebrae, pectoral elements, pelvic elements, forelimb and hindlimb elements, osteoderms). Crocodylus niloticus currently inhabits Madagascar but is locally extinct from this particular region; radiometric dating indicates an age of ~460-310 years before present (BP). This specimen clearly represents a juvenile based on the extremely small size and open sutures/detached neural arches; total body length is estimated to be~1.1m(modern adults of this species range from~4-6 m).

The Tennessee River Basin currently includes populations of at least half of the described contemporary diversity of extant North American freshwater fishes, crayfish, mussel, and gastropod species. However, comparatively little is known about the biodiversity of this basin from the Pleistocene Epoch, particularly the late Pleistocene (~10,000 to 30,000 years B.P.) leading to modern Holocene fish diversity patterns. The objective of this study was to describe the fish assemblages of the Tennessee River Basin from the late Pleistocene using a series of faunas from locales throughout the basin documented from published literature, unpublished reports, and an undocumented fauna from Bell Cave (site ACb-2, Colbert County, AL). Herein we discuss 41 unequivocal taxa from 10 late Pleistocene localities within the basin and include a systematic discussion of 11 families, 19 genera, and 24 identifiable species (28 unequivocal taxa) specific to the Bell Cave locality. Among the described fauna are several extirpated (e.g., Northern Pike Esox lucius, Northern Madtom Noturus stigmosus) and a single extinct (Harelip Sucker Moxostoma lacerum) taxa that suggest a combination of late Pleistocene displacement events coupled with more recent changes in habitat that have resulted in modern basin diversity patterns. The Bell Cave locality represents one of the most intact Pleistocene freshwater fish deposits anywhere in North America. Significant preservational, taphonomic, sampling, and identification biases preclude the identification of additional taxa.

The primarily Neotropical distribution of living alligatoroids raises questions as to when and how the ancestors of Alligator sinensis migrated to China. As phylogeny provides a necessary framework for historical biogeographic issues, determining the phylogenetic positions of the Chinese alligatoroids is a crucial step towards understanding global alligatoroid paleobiogeography. Besides the unnamed alligatoroids from the Eocene of Guangdong Province, three Chinese fossil taxa have been referred to Alligatoroidea: Alligator luicus, Eoalligator chunyii and Eoalligator huiningensis. However, none of these fossil taxa has been included in a phylogenetic analysis. The genus Eoalligator was established to accommodate E. chunyii from Guangdong Province. E. huiningensis from Anhui Province was later erected as a second species, despite no distinctive similarities with E. chunyii. By contrast, the putative crocodyline Asiatosuchus nanlingensis was established based on material from Guangdong Province, close to the E. chunyii specimens geographically and stratigraphically. Furthermore, specimens of A. nanlingensis and E. chunyii share four distinctive characters, but display no evident differences. As a result, the taxonomic relationships of these three species require restudy. Methods. In this paper, all specimens of E. chunyii and E. huiningensis are reassessed in detail, and compared to specimens of A. nanlingensis. Detailed re-descriptions and revised diagnoses are provided, and a cladistic analysis is carried out to assess the phylogenetic positions of E. chunyii, E. huiningensis and A. nanlingensis. Results. The analysis recovers E. chunyii and A. nanlingensis as sister taxa among basal Crocodylidae, while P. huiningensis is posited as an alligatoroid. Two key characters support the monophyly E. chunyii + A. nanlingensis: sulcus within surangular, and anteroposteriorly oriented surangular-articular suture. The former character is unique to E. chunyii and A. nanlingensis among crocodyloids, although a smaller and more posteriorly positioned surangular fossa is known in Diplocynodon. Detailed comparisons show the two species to be synonymous, with E. chunyii as the junior synonym of A. nanlingensis based on page priority. Because E. chunyii was erected as the type species of Eoalligator, the genus is now invalid.Weestablish the new genus Protoalligator to accommodate ``Eoalligator'' huiningensis, an alligatoroid whose exact phylogenetic position is uncertain. In particular, P. huiningensis retains primitive characters such as a lacrimal that extends further anteriorly than the prefrontal, and a notch at the premaxilla-maxilla suture. However, P. huiningensis also appears to share one important derived character, a complete nasal bar, with alligators. Our taxonomic revisions imply that four alligatoroids are currently known from China, and these species must have dispersed from North America to Asia in more than one event. © 2016 Wang et al.","Alligatoroidea; Crocodyloidea; Eoalligator; Paleobiogeography; Phylogeny; Protoalligator; Taxonomy","alligator; Alligator luicus; Alligator sinensis; Article; Asiatosuchus nanlingensis; cervical vertebra; crocodilian; Eoalligator chunyii; Eoalligator huiningensis; mandible; nonhuman; paleontology; phylogeny; skull","Wang, Y.-Y.; Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origins of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and PaleoanthropologyChina; email: paleolacerta@gmail.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992161351

Previous studies show that locomotor behavior influences aspects of cranial shape in leporids, and here we use an extensive 3D geometric morphometrics dataset to further explore what influences leporid cranial diversity. Facial tilt angle, a trait that strongly correlates with locomotor mode, significantly predicts the cranial shape variation captured by the primary axis of cranial shape space, and describes a small proportion (13.2%) of overall cranial shape variation in the clade. However, locomotor mode does not correlate with overall cranial shape variation in the clade, because there are two district morphologies of generalist species, and saltators and cursorial species have similar morphologies. Cranial shape changes due to phyletic size change (evolutionary allometry) also describes a small proportion (12.5%) of cranial shape variation in the clade, but this is largely driven by the smallest living leporid, the pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis). By integrating phylogenetic history with our geometric morphometric data, we show that the leporid cranium exhibits weak phylogenetic signal and substantial homoplasy. Though these results make it difficult to reconstruct what the `ancestral' leporid skull looked like, the fossil records suggest that dorsal arching and facial tilt could have occurred before the origin of the crown group. Lastly, our study highlights the diversity of cranial variation in crown leporids, and highlights a need for additional phylogenetic work that includes stem (fossil) leporids and includes morphological data that captures the transformed morphology of rabbits and hares. ï¿½ 2016 Kraatz and Sherratt.","Geometric morphometrics; Lagomorpha; Leporidae; Macroevolution; X-ray micro computed tomography","allometry; cladistics; dorsal region; face; fossil; homoplasy; human; information processing; locomotion; micro-computed tomography; morphology; morphometrics; nonhuman; pygmy; rabbits and hares; skull","Kraatz, B.; Department of Anatomy, Western University of Health SciencesUnited States; email: bpkraatz@mac.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991373098

Based upon descriptions given during the 19th century, specimens of the genus Mesacanthus fromthe Orcadian Basin and Midland Valley areas of Northern and Central Scotland have historically been referred to a number of different species; of these, the most frequently discussed in the literature are M. mitchelli, M. peachi and M. pusillus. In order to test the validity of these three species, traditional morphometric analyses were carried out on over 100 specimens of Mesacanthus, fromboth the Lower Devonian and the Middle Devonian, that cover the full range of known localities for these taxa in Northern and Central Scotland. Based upon morphological and morphometric comparisons, this investigation has found that at least two species of Mesacanthus are valid (M. mitchelli and M. pusillus) as specimens from the Lower Devonian and Middle Devonian have been shown to differ significantly in a number of important ways. However, no evidence has been found for the validity of the second and distinct MiddleDevonian species, M. peachi. © 2015 Baron.","Acanthodii; Mesacanthus; Morphometrics; Orcadian; Scotland","anatomical concepts; Article; bone length; Chordata; length to width ratio; Mesacanthus; morphology; morphometrics; nonhuman; pectoral fin; pelvis; species difference; spine; spine curvature","Baron, M.G.; Department of Earth Science, University of CambridgeUnited Kingdom",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946195274

The genus has been reassessed by other workers in light of reinterpretations about the postcrania of another putative Triassic ornithischian, Revueltosaurus. The understanding of Triassic dental faunas has become more complicated by the extreme convergence between pseudosuchian archosaurs and ornithischian dinosaur dental morphologies.We report here on a new specimen of Crosbysaurus (MNA V10666) fromthe Chinle Formation at Comb Ridge in southeastern Utah. This new specimen is assigned to Crosbysaurus sp. on the basis of the unique compound posterior denticles, labiolingual width, and curvature. While MNA V10666 does not help resolve the affinities of Crosbysaurus, it does represent the extension of the geographic range of this taxon for approximately 250 kilometers. This is the first record of the genus Crosbysaurus in Utah and as such it represents the northernmost known record of this taxon. This indicates that Crosbysaurus was not limited to the southern area of the Chinle/Dockum deposition but instead was widespread across the Late Triassic paleoriver systems of western Pangea. The reported specimen was found in close association with a typical Late Triassic Chinle fauna, including phytosaurs, metoposaurs, and dinosauromorphs. © 2015 Gay and Aude.","Archosaur; Chinle; Chinle Formation; Comb Ridge; Crosbysaurus; Late Triassic; New occurance; New record; Triassic; Utah","Article; Chinle formation; Crosbysaurus heckert; dinosaur; fossil animal; nonhuman; pedogenesis (soil); stratigraphy; tooth; United States","Gay, R.J.; Science Department, Mission Heights Preparatory High SchoolUnited States; email: rob.gay@leonagroup.com",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982746798

The leg belongs to specimen IVPP V22530 and includes a typical deinonychosaurian pedal phalanx II-2 with a distinct constriction between the enlarged proximal end and the distal condyle as well as a typical deinonychosaurian enlarged pedal phalanx II-3. It possesses a symmetric metatarsus and a slender and long MT V that together suggest it is a dromaeosaurid. Two anatomical traits suggest the leg is microraptorine-like, but a more precise taxonomic referral was not possible: metatarsals II, III and IV are closely appressed distally and the ventral margin of the medial ligament pit of phalanx II-2 is close to the centre of the rounded distal condyle. This taxonomic status invites future efforts to discover additional specimens at the study locality because-whether it is a microraptorine or a close relative-this animal is expected to make important contributions to our understanding of dromaeosaurid evolution and biology. IVPP V22530 also comprises of an isolated dromaeosaurid manual ungual, a proximal portion of a right theropod anterior dorsal rib and an indeterminate bone mass that includes a collection of ribs. Neither the rib fragment nor the bone mass can be confidently referred to Dromaeosauridae, although they may very well belong to the same individual to whomthe left leg belongs. © 2015 Pittman et al.","Balongwula; Bayan Gobi Formation; Deinonychosaur; Dromaeosaurid; Lower Cretaceous; Microraptorine; Nei Mongol; Paravian; Theropod","biology; bone mass; dinosaur; ecosystem; human; human tissue; leg; ligament; ligation; Lower Cretaceous; metatarsal bone; patient referral; phalanx; rib","Pittman, M.; Vertebrate Palaeontology Laboratory, Department of Earth Sciences, The University of Hong KongHong Kong; email: mpittman@hku.hk",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951128926
