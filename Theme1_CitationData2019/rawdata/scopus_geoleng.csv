Discrete element method (DEM) is a useful tool to model this thermo-mechanical coupled process owing to its explicit representation of fracture initiation and propagation. However, the previous DEM models for this are mostly based on spherical discrete elements, which are not able to capture all consequences (e.g. high ratio of compressive to tensile strength) of real rocks (e.g. granite) composed of complex-geometry grains. In order to overcome this intrinsic limitation, we present a new model allowing to mimick thermally induced damage of brittle rock with non-spherical grains. After validations, the new model is used to study thermal gradient cracking with a special emphasis on the effects from rock heterogeneity. The obtained fracture initiation and propagation are consistent with experimental observations, which demonstrates the ability of current model to reproduce the thermally induced damage of rocks. Meanwhile, the results show that rock heterogeneity influences thermal gradient cracking significantly, and more micro cracks uniformly scattering around the borehole are induced in the heterogeneous sample, which is not good for applications such as nuclear waste disposal. The present model provides a promising approach at micro-scale to explore mechanisms of thermally induced damage of rocks in geological engineering. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Discrete element method; Non-spherical grains; Thermally induced damage; Thermo-mechanical coupled process","Cracks; Finite difference method; Rocks; Spheres; Tensile strength; Thermal gradients; Waste disposal; Complex geometries; Explicit representation; Fracture initiation; Geophysical systems; Non-Spherical; Rock heterogeneity; Thermally induced; Thermo-mechanical coupled; Fracture","Wang, M.; Department of Engineering Mechanics and CNMM, Tsinghua UniversityChina; email: mrwang@tsinghua.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",00225096,,JMPSA,,"English","J Mech Phys Solids",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045061483

In this study, detailed field surveys, in-situ tests and numerical simulations were performed to investigate the stability and failure mechanism of bedded rock masses surrounding a large underground cavern at the Wudongde hydropower station in China. First, a 3D real time, movable microseismic (MS) monitoring system was installed to analyze the stability of the underground caverns. The micro-fracturing processes and potential failure mechanism of cataclinal layered rock masses were revealed by the spatial distribution evolution and seismic source parameters (i.e., S-wave to P-wave energy ratios, namely Es/Ep) of the MS events. Then, an approach integrating the field surveys, MS monitoring and conventional measurements, is proposed for evaluating the cavern stability and identifying the high risk regions in the bedded rock masses during the staged excavations. Subsequently, discrete element method (DEM) was adopted to depict the progressive failure processes of the layered rock masses. The relationship between the failure in the upstream sidewall and the orientation and spacing of bedding planes was analysed. Abovementioned investigations allow us finally to conclude that the failure mechanism of the steeply cataclinal layered rock strata after cavern excavation is a combination of (1) the composite bending and sliding occurring in the lower part of the upstream sidewall with no supports, and (2) the opening and shear dislocation of bedding planes in the middle area. Timely supports for the rock strata at the toe of sidewall might be an effective way for preventing the occurrence of the studied failure. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bedded rock masses; Discrete element method; Failure mechanism; MS monitoring; Stability analysis","Caves; Excavation; Failure (mechanical); Finite difference method; Microseismic monitoring; Rock mechanics; Seismic waves; Seismology; Shear waves; Stability; Surveys; Wave energy conversion; Bedded rock; Conventional measurements; Failure mechanism; Large underground caverns; Progressive failure process; Stability analysis; Underground opening; Wudongde hydropower stations; Rocks","Dai, F.; State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, College of Water Resources and Hydropower, Sichuan UniversityChina; email: fengdai@scu.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",08867798,,,,"English","Tunn.

Considering the importance of subsurface soil characterization in urban areas in geotechnical and geological engineering projects, the present study was conducted to propose a three-dimensional (3D) geological engineering model using the sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) approach for the subsurface soil of the city of Kerman, southeast Iran. Due to the intense variability of soil in the study area, civil engineering projects are sometimes encountered with severe problems in the city. Hence, a better understanding of the soil-related problems has to be gained for dealing with issues in the current and future civil engineering works. The main goal of the present research is to incorporate the SGS method for studying the spatial variability of soil through variograms and then forecasting the values of soil properties at unsampled locations. For this purpose, index geotechnical parameters, including standard penetration test number (SPTN), fine-grained material percentage, plasticity index (PI), and liquid limit (LL), were used as the input data. A database consisting of 700 borehole data was prepared. Then, the raw data were normalized prior to importing to the SGS model. Next, maps related to the average of all realizations along with the coefficient of variation (CV) were prepared for each variable. Finally, the prepared maps were interpreted based on the sedimentary environment of Kerman. © 2018 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature","3D model; Kerman; Sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS); Subsurface soils; Variogram","Soils; Stratigraphy; 3-d modeling; Kerman; Sequential Gaussian simulation; Subsurface soil; Variograms; Soil testing","Lashkaripour, G.R.; Department of Geology, Faculty of Science, Ferdowsi University of MashhadIran; email: lashkaripour@um.ac.ir",,"Springer Verlag",14359529,,,,"English","Bull.

In recent years, growing urbanization and construction of high-rise buildings in Mashhad City, Iran, have increased the demand for 3D models as a basis for subsurface characterization. In this regard, this study deals with the development of a 3D geological engineering model for standard penetration test (SPT) results on Mashhad City sedimentary deposits using sequential indicator simulation (SIS) and sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) approaches. Reliable estimation of SPT values can be helpful in prediction of other geotechnical properties such as soil strength parameters and bearing capacity. The intense variability of the Mashhad sedimentary basin gives rise to complex and challenging ground conditions for civil engineering work. A better understanding of these deposits is crucial for many current and future civil engineering projects. Since design parameters in the study area are usually determined based on SPT results, 12,440 SPT data collected from 1380 boreholes were employed as the input data. After variability analysis, the SIS procedure was applied to coded data to determine areas with very dense sediments (areas with SPT > 50). Then, data with SPT values < 50 were transformed into normal scores in order for them to be applicable as input data in SGS. Finally, coupled maps showing the results of these two approaches were provided for different depths. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Mashhad City; Sequential Gaussian Simulation; Sequential Indicator Simulation; SPT data; Subsurface characterization","Deposits; Geology; Input output programs; Sedimentology; Tall buildings; Mashhad cities; Sequential Gaussian simulation; Sequential indicator simulations; SPT data; Subsurface characterizations; Soil testing; bearing capacity; computer simulation; geostatistics; geotechnical engineering; geotechnical property; penetration test; prediction; sedimentary basin; soil strength; spatial variation; standard (reference); three-dimensional modeling; Iran; Mashhad; Razavi Khorasan","Hafezi Moghaddas, N.; Department of Geology, Faculty of Science, Ferdowsi University of MashhadIran; email: nhafezi@um.ac.ir",,"Springer Verlag",14359529,,,,"English","Bull.

They are widely distributed along the Alps-Tethys suture zone, the Pacific belt, and continental slopes. Previous detailed studies on mud volcanoes concentrated mostly on onshore areas. Recent developments in geophysical technology have opened vast deepwater areas for research on mud volcanoes. Based on multibeam bathymetry, multichannel seismic reflection, gravity, and magnetics data, mud volcanoes in the northern Zhongjiannan Basin have been studied comprehensively and systematically. Abundant mud volcanoes were found in the whole Northern Depression of the basin, not only in the Zhongjian Valley but also in the Rizhao Valley, with different sizes, morphologies, and eruption intensities. Five types of mud volcanoes are identified in the study area, which include the following: deep source high-energy large-size mud volcanoes, shallow source low-energy small-size mud volcanoes, budding mud volcanoes (mud diapir), mud volcanoes related to canyon and bottom current channels, and mud volcanoes related to pockmarks and gas chimneys. At the developmental scale, the distribution and type of mud volcanoes (diapirs) in the Zhongjiannan Basin are obviously different than those in the Yinggehai Basin, which is famous for the development of a large number of large mud diapirs in the North-western South China Sea. The region's tectonic and sedimentary environment is the main controlling factor of the development of mud volcanoes. Three sets of Tertiary thick mudstones in the Zhongjiannan Basin are the material basis for the formation of mud volcanoes. Overpressured fluid, generated from the combined factors of undercompaction, hydrocarbon generation, hydrothermal pressurization, and tectonic compression, is the driving force of the eruption of mud volcanoes. Furthermore, earthquakes that occurred in the surrounding areas of the Zhongjiannan Basin are the triggering mechanism of mud volcano eruptions. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Classification; Development characteristics; Formation mechanism; Mud volcano; Northern Zhongjiannan Basin; Western South China Sea",,"Wan, Z.email: wanzhif@mail.sysu.edu.cn",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",00721050,,,,"English","Geol.

The glass sand has the refractive index identical to that of the mixture of two white mineral oils as pore fluid. The transparent sand possesses significant advantages in transparency. In interior natural lighting environment, the transparent sand has a clear visible depth of 14 cm and a maximum visible depth of 20 cm. It also has advantages in non-toxicity and stable nature. Laboratory tests including direct shear, one-dimensional compression, compaction, consolidation-drained triaxial and permeability tests were conducted to demonstrate physical, mechanical, and permeability properties of the transparent sand agree with those of natural sands. As a comparison and reference for the further study, the main properties of available water-saturated fused quartz and transparent sands by other researchers were also summarized in this paper.

In this study, evaluation of this parameter in a granular soil deposit was examined by using two anisotropic components of the S-wave velocity (SV and SH-wave components). To this end, thirteen pairs of P- and S-wave seismic refraction profiles were acquired at two different granular sites in Iran. The collected shot gathers were processed, from which the SV and SH-wave velocities were derived. The SV-wave velocities were obtained by using the Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) method while the SH-wave velocities were extracted by utilizing the Multichannel Analysis of Love Waves (MALW) technique. The reference K0 values in the soil deposits were calculated by the Mayne and Kulhawy's formula based on the friction angles (φ′) and overconsolidation ratios (OCR) determined from laboratory tests. The curves of the reference K0 values versus the SH/SV velocity ratios at both sites strongly confirmed the feasibility of K0 evaluation from the velocity components. To develop a global equation for K0 evaluation in granular soil deposits, a general regression analysis was conducted on the obtained data from this study combined with those reported in the literature. The results showed that reliable values of K0 can be estimated using the SH/SV velocity ratios. The findings of this study may appropriately serve as references for economic and non-invasive in-situ K0 identification in granular soil deposits using the surface wave methods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anisotropy; Granular soils; Lateral earth pressure coefficient at-rest; Multichannel analysis of Love waves; Multichannel analysis of surface waves; Shear wave velocity","Acoustic wave velocity; Anisotropy; Deposits; Pressure distribution; Regression analysis; Retaining walls; Shear waves; Soils; Surface waves; Velocity; Wave propagation; At rests; Granular soils; Love wave; Multi-channel analysis of surface waves; Shear wave velocity; Shear flow; earth pressure; granular medium; Love wave; overconsolidation; P-wave; regression analysis; S-wave; seismic anisotropy; seismic refraction","Liu, H.; School of Civil Engineering and Mechanics, Huazhong University of Science and TechnologyChina; email: hbliu@hust.edu.cn",,"Elsevier B.V.",00137952,,EGGOA,,"English","Eng.

The results demonstrate that significant differences in critical shear stress exist among high, middle, and low tidal flats, which are influenced by biodisturbation in the different sedimentary lobes. Regional characteristics of the modern Yellow River Delta show that critical shear stress levels are the lowest in the northern area (0.11–0.4 Pa), are the highest in the eastern area (2.8–4.55 Pa), and are significantly heterogeneous in the northeastern area.

So it is significant to choose suitable efficient development technologies based on CBM geological factors for high-rank CBM recovery enhancement. In view of this, CBM geological factors were analyzed, different geological models were established and the corresponding models of development engineering technologies were thus put forward. It was proposed that the four main factors affecting high-rank CBM recovery from a lower degree to a higher degree respectively include coal structure, vitrinite reflectance, geo-stress, and the ratio of critical desorption pressure to initial reservoir pressure. On this basis, four geological-engineering models were classified as follows: Vertical wells; open-hole and multilateral horizontal wells; U-shaped and tree-like horizontal wells; Fish-bone and L-shaped wells. It is concluded that the former two models are more adaptable in such areas with better coal structures and high degree of thermal maturity, while the latter two are commonly applied in a wide range of areas. © 2017, Natural Gas Industry Journal Agency.

Such a tool is the generation of DFNs and their integration into the geomechanical design, with a specific focus on underground projects such as tunnels, caverns, repositories etc. This paper attempts to show an approach in which LiDAR data from the Brockville Tunnel, located in Ontario, Canada, is used as the source for the determination of input parameters of DFN modelling based on manual and automatic mapping techniques. Having determined a representative set of input parameters, a deterministic DFN model is created in order to calibrate other modelling parameters associated with the generation process, leading to the creation of multiple DFN models.

Various problems occurred in the construction of the tunnel, including large deformation of surrounding rocks, cracks of preliminary supports and secondary linings as well as creeping down and collapse of surrounding rock masses along schistosity planes. In which, the most serious problem was large deformation of surrounding rocks, which not only dramatically delayed the normal construction progress of the tunnel, but also brought a huge challenge for the safety of builders. In order to solve this problem, detailed investigations were made on site in the study to reveal the regional geological, engineering geological and hydrogeological conditions of the tunnel. By conducting geo-stress measurement on site, the characteristics of geo-stress field of Erdaoya tunnel were analyzed from four aspects, including magnitudes of stress, coefficient of lateral pressure, orientation of stress and the relationship between magnitudes of geo-stresses and depths. By applying the DIPS software for interactively analyzing geological locator data, structure characteristics of rock masses were analyzed for preferred structural planes and schistosity planes in the tunnel site. Furthermore, the authors tested the physical and hydrological properties of the rock specimens collected on-site. So various physical properties (density, void fraction, and wave velocity) and water absorption hydrological property of schist were obtained, which provide underlying parameters support for the deformation and support of surrounding rocks of the tunnel. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Failure mode; Hydrological property; Rock mass deformation; Schist; Tunnel","Deformation; Failure modes; Geology; Hydrogeology; Physical properties; Problem solving; Rock mechanics; Rocks; Tunnel linings; Void fraction; Water absorption; Wave propagation; Construction progress; Deformation of surrounding rock; Geo-stress measurements; Hydrogeological conditions; Hydrological properties; Rock mass deformation; Schist; Structure characteristic; Tunnels; deformation; failure mechanism; hydrogeology; physical property; rock mass response; rock property; schist; stress field; stress measurement; tunnel; tunneling; China; Hubei; Shanxi; Shiyan","Zhang, B.; Zhangjiakou Vocational and Technical CollegeChina; email: huh075@163.com",,"Springer International Publishing",09603182,,GGENE,,"English","Geotech.

The results of the experimental study demonstrated a suitable mix design for the upper and lower regions of the cement-grading curve that are important for grouting and stabilization. Increasing the fineness of the cement decreased the permeability and increased the compressive strength of grouted sand samples considerably after two weeks. Moreover, relative to finer (higher Blaine value) or coarser (lower Blaine value) cements, cement with a Blaine value of 5,100 cm2/g was optimal for void reduction in a grouted soil mass.

The use of geological forensic may be applied to fulfill legal purposes of insurance agency, compensation decisions, and also criminal cases. In this study case, geotechnical and geological engineering are used beforehand in order to identify the cause of geological phenomenon by using quantitative assessment. Soil movement disaster can be caused by several aspects. The assessment of the disaster which is rapid creeping movement of soil is conducted in a disaster case of Cigintung, West Java. The impact of disaster is significant enough to affect up to 700 families, which have to be evacuated from the disaster site, due to massive infrastructural damage. The soil of the area is categorized into clay with high plasticity and silt with high plasticity, which liquid limit (LL) is vary between 77.77% - 98.41%. Activity number (A) of each soils are is vary between 0.964 - 2.192. Based on Skempton Chart is indicating montmorillonitic and illitic soils, and also the cause of their characteristic which is swelling if it is wet and shrinking if it is dry. Therefore, by using Seed method and William &amp; Donovan Chart, we can conclude that soil in the area is categorized into expansive soil due to its high tendency of swelling-shrinking characteristic. Chronologically, the soil movement in Cigintung is initiated with first landslide which caused surface water to infiltrate easier into porous soil and reach the expansive soil below it. The second soil movement occurred rapidly and affected almost all infrastructures in the area in 12 hours timespan, due to the change of soil bearing capacity which caused by water infiltration. The accepted soil bearing capacity (qa) with factor of stability (FS) = 3 for square-shaped shallow foundation is between 3.66 T/m2 - 9.52 T/m2, while for circle-shaped foundation is between 3.67 T/m2 - 7.53 T/m2, and for column-shaped foundation is between 2.50 T/m2 - 4.27 T/m2. Based on that, if infrastructure development did not properly conducted, each person who allegedly who did it may have to pay compensation for the damage as the disaster might not force majeure (Article 87 verse (1) Regulation No. 32 Year 2009). And if not, government may have to compensate the damage as a part of disaster mitigation policy or evacuate the affected communities (Government Regulation No. 21 Year 2008).",,,"Zakaria, Z.; Faculty of Geological Engineering, Universitas PadjadjaranIndonesia; email: zufialdi.zakaria@unpad.ac.id","Meilano I.Zulfakriza","American Institute of Physics Inc.",0094243X,9780735415317,,,"English","AIP Conf.

In order to investigate the engineering behaviors and its regularity, a series of tests including plate loading test, deep spiral plate loading test, compaction test and resilience modulus test is conducted on different zones in Yongxing Island, South China Sea. Engineering mechanical parameters including bearing capacity, deformation modulus, rebound modulus of coral reef are obtained. The test results show that the bearing capacity and deformation modulus of artificial calcareous soil ground are higher than those of reef flat foundation and sand bar foundation. The bearing capacity of artificial calcareous soil ground ranges from 320 to 360 kPa, and its deformation modulus ranges from 95 to 200 MPa. The bearing capacity of ground satisfies the requirement of low-rise buildings. As settlement of calcareous ground accompanies instantaneously under loading, fast loading method can be adopted in the plate loading test.

The occurrences of landslide led to blockage of the freeway. A cutting was designed with a width and height of 4 and 6 m, respectively, and a 5 to 6 m excavation depth within a 120 m line along the slope toe. Based on the site investigations, the landslide was characterized as a complex deep-seated landslide, displaying composite rotational-debris flow. Moreover, extensive field survey, subsurface investigation, laboratory and in situ tests show that although the landslide was triggered by an inappropriate cutting, geostructural, geological engineering properties and hydrology have also played a key role in its initiation and further aggravation. Therefore, the western and eastern boundaries of the landslide coincide with the two faults (F1 and F2). In addition, landslide sinisterly movement is controlled by a left lateral strike-slip fault (F2). It was observed that the scarp follows the N130°/75 direction of bedding rocks. The presence of marls and shale implies a high swelling under wet conditions, thus providing lubricating sliding surfaces. In addition, alteration and weathering of andesite, basalt, tuffite, and tuff have been reduced the shear strength of the slope.

Studies were conducted on a section of the active Just-Tegoborze landslide in the southern region of Poland. The landslide is intersected by the state road no. 75, which has a high traffic density. Measurements of the seismic interferometry were made on the basis of the registration of a local high-frequency noise generated mostly by passing heavy vehicles. Measurements were carried out in three series on January, March and July in 2015. Seismic noise vibration was registered using Güralp CMG-6TD broadband seismometers. One of the seismic profiles was located along a geological engineering cross-section prepared from research boreholes data. One of the main results of the work was the sections of changes of shear wave velocity. The interpreted seismic boundaries made it possible to correlate them with the lithological ones. The trough-like shape of the bedrock boundary may be an effect of weathering processes developed in the zone consisting of weak hieroglyphic beds. It is also supposed to be one of the slip surfaces. The seismic sections of shear wave velocity allowed to analyse velocity variations between three measurement series and to compare them with expected water content in colluvium deposits.

In higher accuracy measurements, the microgravity method has been widely and successfully used for locating and monitoring subsurface materials. Since microgravity methods measure gravity variations at the surface, they are directly influenced by the density distribution in the subsurface and particularly by the presence of formation material, which may create a mass deficit relative to the density of the surrounding terrain. In many cases, deep or small-scale heterogeneities generating low-amplitude anomalies can be detected and the reliability of further interpretation requires highly accurate measurements which are carefully corrected for any quantifiable disturbing effects. The main purpose of the research, that was conducted in small part of a dam site, is to determine the quality and type of subsurface structures in location of tunnel construction. Study area for collecting microgravity data was located at a small part, considered for construction of Siah Bisheh dam, road Tehran to Chalous. Position of microgravity stations were over a tunnel path which in some parts encountered with collapsing structures. The study area was part of Alborz Mountains. Geology formation(Shemshak formation), consisting of lime beds together with igneous rocks which are severely affected by fractures. Data were collected along 13 profiles with separating distance of 15 m. The stations distance and number of data were 15 m and 148 respectively. Bouguer gravity anomaly was calculated after making corrections such as earth tide, free air, Bouguer, topography and terrain effects. The regional effect obtained using a program that is written in FORTRAN to fit orthogonal and orthonormal polynomials on the observed data and then residuals were estimated. Three negative anomalies were distinguishable in residual gravity map. Data of these anomalies are modeled with a 3-D inversion approach using GROWTH 2.0 software. The GROWTH 2.0 is an inversion tool which enables the user to obtain, in a nearly automatic and non-subjective mode, a 3D model of the subsurface density anomalies based on the observed gravity anomaly data. The current version of the tool has been developed from an earlier code (Camacho et al., 2002). In a nearly automatic approach, the software provides a 3-D model informing on the location and shape of the main structural building blocks of the subsurface structures. Then densities contrast of these anomalies was estimated. Result of the inversion was a 3-D distribution of densities contrast. To show this distribution of the densities contrast, the horizontal and vertical sections at different depth and different horizontal positions were selected and interpreted. From these sections it is indicated that the effective depth of the data, for identifying martial of subsurface structures from the inversion, is about 50 m. In the sections, areas with low densitig contrasts are related to the fractured limestone and those with high contrast ones are related to the compact limestone or igneous rocks. Existence of igneous and lime rocks that have more density and compactness, increase the quality of the structures in the path of the tunnel construction. Areas including fractured limestone, with lower density, decrease the quality of the structure and increase the risk of water permeability and collapsing in the path of the tunnel construction.

If the cluster spacing is too small, the stimulated area between major fractures will be overlapped, and the efficiency of fracturing stimulation will be decreased. If the cluster spacing is too large, the area between major fractures cannot be stimulated completely and reservoir recovery extent will be adversely impacted. At present, cluster spacing design is mainly based on the static model with the potential reservoir stimulation area as the target, and there is no cluster spacing design method in accordance with the actual fracturing process and targets dynamic stimulated reservoir volume (SRV). In this paper, a dynamic SRV calculation model for cluster fracture propagation was established by analyzing the coupling mechanisms among fracture propagation, fracturing fluid loss and stress. Then, the cluster spacing was optimized to reach the target of optimal SRV. This model was applied for validation on site in the Jiaoshiba shale gasfield in the Fuling area of the Sichuan Basin. The key geological engineering parameters influencing the optimal cluster spacing were analyzed. The reference charts for optimal cluster spacing design were prepared based on the geological characteristics of south and north blocks in the Jiaoshiba shale gasfield.

In this study, we developed a model for the analysis of coupled hydro-mechanical processes in porous rock containing dominant fractures, by using the numerical manifold method (NMM). In the current model, the fractures are regarded as different material domains from surrounding rock, i.e., finite-thickness fracture zones as porous media. Compared with the rock matrix, these fractured porous media are characterized with nonlinear behavior of hydraulic and mechanical properties, involving not only direct (poroelastic) coupling but also indirect (property change) coupling. By combining the potential energy associated with mechanical responses, fluid flow and solid–fluid interactions, a new formulation for direct HM coupling in porous media is established. For indirect coupling associated with fracture opening/closure, we developed a new approach implicitly considering the nonlinear properties by directly assembling the corresponding strain energy. Compared with traditional methods with approximation of the nonlinear constitutive equations, this new formulation achieves a more accurate representation of the nonlinear behavior. We implemented the new model for coupled HM analysis in NMM, which has fixed mathematical grid and accurate integration, and developed a new computer code. We tested the code for direct coupling on two classical poroelastic problems with coarse mesh and compared the results with the analytical solutions, achieving excellent agreement, respectively. Finally, we tested for indirect coupling on models with a single dominant fracture and obtained reasonable results. The current poroelastic NNM model with a continuous finite-thickness fracture zone will be further developed considering thin fractures in a discontinuous approach for a comprehensive model for HM analysis in fractured porous rock masses. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Direct coupling; Finite-thickness fracture zone; Fractured porous rock mass; Hydro-mechanical processes; Indirect coupling; Numerical manifold method",,"Wang, Y.; Energy Geosciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National LaboratoryUnited States; email: wangyuanhhu@163.com",,"Springer Verlag",18611125,,,,"English","Acta Geotech.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990866053

Voronoi diagram has important applications in rock engineering and geological engineering. However, the application of 3D Voronoi models has been limited due to the difficulty of generating 3D Voronoi domains. Little research has been done on the Voronoi tessellations of objects with irregular shapes. Voronoi tessellations of objects with regular and irregular shapes are investigated by using the Matlab function mpt_voronoi. The proposed models are then employed to simulate micro-fracturing and tension cracks in brittle rock. The 3D Voronoi grain-based slope model is used to investigate the dynamic response and failure mechanism of the rock slopes during earthquakes. The failures of rock slopes are actually due to the increasing and expanding of the tension cracks, the development of the tension surfaces and sliding of the blocks during earthquakes. The 2D Voronoi grain-based specimen composed of clusters is adopted to carry out rock fragmentation by TBM cutters. PFC simulation results reveal that the damaged rock undergoes some volume dilation that causes the expansion of the crushed zone and the propagation of the vertical crack. The rock fragmentations are actually caused by the increasing of the tension cracks.

The dispersed point charts of stress varying with depth were established and the regression formulas of each parameter with depth were calculated. The research shows that σH, σh change with depth linearly and KH, Kh, Ka change with depth hyperbolically. KHh, μH, μm change with depth almost linearly. The comparison of the regression formulae of surface and shallow layer show that the difference of regression formula of horizontal principal stress is significant, the difference of regression formula of lateral pressure coefficient is small and the difference of regression formula of ratio parameters is basically the same. These indicate that the surface stress data can be applied to the analysis of stress accumulation and seismic activity in the brittle crust. The combination of μm with μH is necessary to determine the energy accumulation at the points of μm&gt;0.7 in stress accumulation analysis. The comprehensive research on μm and μH lead to the conclusion that 19 surface points in Bohai strait and 86% shallow points in the surrounding district are in the middle-low level of stress accumulation, and the crustal stability is high. Some points in Beijing, Tianjing and Tangshan are in the state of high stress accumulation, and the crustal stability is low which need more attention.

Due to continuous excavations on the rock slope, different regions of the surrounding rock mass undergo varying degrees of unloading deformation. It is important to assess the stability of the rock slope from a macroscopic viewpoint by investigating its deformation characteristics and mechanisms. Therefore, in this work, microseismic (MS) monitoring was first employed to detect the progressive rock mass damage in the rock slope subjected to excavation, including the initiation, propagation, coalescence, and interaction of rock microfractures. Numerical modeling was subsequently performed to understand the deformation and failure mechanism of the rock slope. Moreover, traditional surveying approaches (i.e., multiple-point extensometers and inclinometers) and field observations were also used to analyze the deformation and failure characteristics of the rock slope. The MS monitoring results showed that spatiotemporal regularities in the evolution of seismic source locations were indicators of deformation failure and potential sliding surfaces. MS event clustering can be used to delineate activated pre-existing geological structures (i.e., LS331 and LS337). The simulation results show that the deformation and failure characteristics of the rock slope are mainly controlled by pre-existing weak structural planes (i.e., the intraformational faulted zones LS3319, LS331, and LS337 and fault F17). These results agree well with the results of geological data and conventional monitoring data. Our study reveals that an integrated approach combining MS monitoring, numerical modeling, traditional surveying, and field observations leads to a better understanding of the behavior of the rock slope under the influence of excavation as well as greater control of the working faces, ensuring safety under complex geological and excavation conditions. © 2017 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Baihetan hydropower station; Microseismic monitoring; Rock slope; Stability analysis; UDEC","Deformation; Excavation; Geology; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Microseismic monitoring; Numerical models; Rock mechanics; Rocks; Seismology; Stability; Surveying; Surveys; Unloading; Deformation and failure mechanism; Deformation and failures; Deformation Characteristics; Hydropower stations; Potential sliding surfaces; Rock slope; Stability analysis; UDEC; Slope stability","Dai, F.; State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, College of Water Resource and Hydropower, Sichuan UniversityChina; email: fengdai@scu.edu.cn",,"Springer Verlag",14359529,,,,"English","Bull.

Anthropogenic transformation in this region is indicated by the gradual filling of excavation voids in varved clays with various kinds of waste (both municipal and industrial). The S8 Marki bypass expressway was designed to pass through such an area. Recreating the bottom relief of the excavated varved clays, and reliably estimating the degree of anthropogenic transformation would be difficult if only traditional, standard geological engineering investigations were applied. Electrical resistivity is a parameter, which reflects the diverse properties of the geological media. When calibrated with drill hole data, the resistivity enabled the accurate determination of the base of the anthropogenic soil. The GPR method, in contrast, was only useful to a limited extent, because of the high attenuation of electromagnetic waves in most of the deposited man-made soils. From the analysis of the completed surveys, a two-dimensional image of the subsurface ground structure, reflecting the anthropogenic impact on the environment, was obtained. This image was the basis for the development of the schematic model of the geological setting after human interference. The methodologies applied allowed us to interpret the spatial distribution of the different soils, including the anthropogenic soils of low bearing capacity and the probable connection between two aquifers.

A new insect species, Cixius discretus (Hemiptera, Fulgoromorpha), from the Lower Miocene Garang Formation of Zeku County, Qinghai Province (northeastern Tibetan Plateau) is described. This species can be assigned to Cixiidae and represents the first fossil representative of this family from Qinghai Province. Based on the recent single-origin hypothesis and the distribution of tectonic plates in the Cretaceous, we consider that ancient Cixius had dispersed globally prior to the Cretaceous. Through analysis of the habitats of extant Cixius, the palaeoclimate and fossil flora of the Zeku area during the Miocene, we interpret the climate of Zeku in the early Miocene to have been warm-temperate and mildly arid.

A structural survey conducted at an oil refinery in the Leningrad region showed numerous faults and damages caused by settlements of the bearing structures and their foundations. Traces of leakages on the retaining walls of the pumphouse as well as next to the pipeline inlets witness a man-triggered raise of the ground water level. Crack formation in bottoms and walls of the aerotanks and sludge tanks was also denoted. It might be caused by the reduction of foundation soil bearing capacity. In its turn, deterioration of physical and mechanical features of the foundation soil is linked to the change in the hydrological regime of the area, which is proved by rich seepage of ground waters through the cracks in tanks. Having analyzed the structural and geological engineering conditions the authors recommend elaborating and performing a project to restore the proper working order of structures. © 2017 The Authors.","faults and damages; Geological engineering conditions; retaining walls; structural units","Cracks; Geology; Groundwater; Retaining walls; Soils; Tanks (containers); Water levels; Bearing structure; Geological engineering conditions; Geotechnical analysis; Hydrological regime; Mechanical feature; Structural behaviour; Structural surveys; Structural unit; Faulting","Gorodnova, E.V.; Emperor Alexander i St. Petersburg State Transport University, 9, Moskovsky pr., Russian Federation; email: elena.gorodnova@mail.ru",,"Elsevier Ltd",18777058,,,,"English","Procedia Eng.",Conference Paper,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020714717

The results show that the axial force of the squeezed branch pile changes obviously at the site of the squeezed branch. Additionally, this study identifies the sequenced effects of frictional resistance; the displacement patterns of the soil around the pile, particularly below the branch and pile tip; the minimum center distance between piles in a group, which should be greater than 1.5 times the branch diameter; and the location of plastic strain in the soil below the branches and pile tip. The data reveal that the vertical bearing capacity of squeezed branch pile is 16 to 30% higher than that of normal pile under the same conditions; furthermore, the vertical bearing capacity of squeezed branch pile increases as the number of branches and horizontal load increase.

Two techniques have been applied: electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) and measurements with a resistivity cone penetration test (RCPT). ERI measurements made using Schlumberger and gradient arrays have allowed to obtain a two-dimensional image of resistivity variability in the soil medium. RCPT measurements have enabled an accurate observation of vertical changes in electrical resistivity (or conductivity) in the soil medium in selected measurement points. Electrical resistivity is a physical parameter that may reflect the variability of the geological medium with regard to lithology if the range of conductivity of water filling the pore space is narrow. When it is properly calibrated with borehole data, ERI interpretation allows to determine the boundaries between different soil layers. Adaptation of the “cumulative resistivity” method to RCPT data enabled to distinguish layers characterized by different physical properties and corresponding to boundaries of geological-engineering layers.

The silty loess has great importance due to the extended surface and the several reported risks. Loess soil is one of the problematic soils in which some of the geotechnical properties should be modified or improved before conducting the projects. Loess is one of the soil types available in many countries and a great number of geotechnical risks were reported regarding them. The current study investigated the effect of adding nanokaolinite on the compressibility and the Atterberg limit of the silty loess soil of Golestan province through the field sampling and performing tests with the different percent of nanokaolinite. To prepare the nanokaolinite, the mechanical method of ball milling was employed. According to the grain size distribution tests, the soil sample is CL-ML type based on unified classification. Standard proctor test results showed that adding the nanokaolinite increased the maximum dry unit weight of the soil at first and then it was decreased. Moreover, adding nanokaolinite resulted in the significant increases of liquid and plastic limits while nanokaolinite amount more than 5% led to the decrease in plastic index. © Avestia Publishing, 2016.","Atterberg limit; Compressibility; Golestan province; Nanokaolinite; Silty loess soil",,,,"Avestia Publishing",23698128,9781927877319,,,"English","Proc.

A key feature of the proposed method is that it incorporates the combined effects of geological, engineering and economic uncertainties. Estimating the viability of a CCS project is mainly determined by (a) storage formation properties and (b) economic parameters. Since these factors are uncertain, the most appropriate way to examine the project feasibility is to conduct probabilistic analyses that take into account both the storage formation and economic parameters at the same time. We illustrate this process with a simple hypothetical, but representative CCS project. We determine the project's profitability, storage capacity and risks of CO2 leakage for 5 development injection designs. We assign probability distributions to the following parameters – storage formation thickness, storage formation areal extent, horizontal permeability, vertical to horizontal permeability ratio, storage price, capital costs, operating costs, escalation rates and discount rates. Then we use the storage formation property distributions to generate CO2 injection profiles and their associated probabilities. Finally, they are incorporated in a probabilistic economic model to generate a probability distribution of profitability, storage capacity and the risks of leakage. We propose a development index which combines the sub-surface risks and economic uncertainties associated with a specific development plan. This single number makes it easier for decision makers to compare different designs in an uncertain environment. The value of this index can vary according to the weights given to sub-surface risks and economic uncertainties. ï¿½ 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CCS; Decision making; Economics; Monte Carlo; Probabilistic; Risk; Simulation","Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Decision making; Economics; Monte Carlo methods; Operating costs; Probability; Profitability; Risks; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Economic uncertainty; Probabilistic; Probabilistic analysis; Probabilistic methods; Project feasibility; Simulation; Uncertain environments; Probability distributions; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; computer simulation; decision making; environmental economics; Monte Carlo analysis; probability; profitability; risk assessment",,,"Elsevier Ltd",17505836,,,,"English","Int.

This paper presents new development of the TOUGH-UDEC simulator for analysis of coupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical (THM) processes in fractured porous media. As an alternative to developing a single coupled THM code in discontinuum, two existing well-established codes, namely TOUGH2 and UDEC, are coupled to cover coupled THM analysis of multiphase fluid flow, heat transfer, and deformation in fractured porous media. TOUGH2 is widely used for modeling heat transfer and multiphase, multicomponent fluid flow, and UDEC is a well-known discrete element code for rock mechanics, which have been verified and used by many groups all over the world. Although a sequential coupling of two codes is less efficient than having a single code in principal, a big advantage with coupling of TOUGH2 and UDEC is that both codes are well tested and widely applied in their respective fields. When linking two codes, the coupled equations cannot be solved simultaneously; they should be solved sequentially, with coupling parameters passed to each equation at specific intervals. After solving thermal-hydraulic equations through the TOUGH2 model, pressure (P) and temperature (T) information is delivered to UDEC model. Pressure information is directly stored at the center of each UDEC zone and domain, however, temperature information is interpolated from zone-centers to the corners nodes. After solving the mechanical equation through the UDEC model-considering new pressure and temperature-calculated fracture apertures are converted to equivalent permeability and porosity for TOUGH2 flow analysis. The solution was calculated by iteratively following an explicit sequence for numerical efficiency. Verification examples are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the coupled TOUGH-UDEC simulator. © 2015 by the Canadian Institute of Mining.","Fractured porous media; THM coupling; TOUGH-UDEC","Codes (symbols); Deformation; Enhanced recovery; Fracture; Geological repositories; Geothermal fields; Heat transfer; Mechanical permeability; Mechanics; Multiphase flow; Porous materials; Rock mechanics; Rocks; Simulators; Engineering applications; Enhanced geothermal systems; Fractured porous media; Nuclear waste repositories; Pressure and temperature; Thermal hydraulic equations; THM coupling; TOUGH-UDEC; Flow of fluids","Min, K.B.; Department of Energy Resources Engineering, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, South Korea; email: kbmin@snu.ac.kr","HassaniHadjigeorgiouArchibald","International Society for Rock Mechanics",,9781926872254,,,"English","ISRM Int.

A well-known difficulty of this classical solution is to determine the elastic field outside the ellipsoidal inclusion. In this paper, we first analytically present the full displacement field of an ellipsoidal inclusion subjected to uniform eigenstrain. It is demonstrated that the displacements inside inclusion are linearly related to the coordinates and continuous across the interface of inclusion and matrix. The exterior displacement, which is less detailed in existing literatures, may be expressed in a more compact, explicit, and simpler form through utilizing the outward unit normal vector of an auxiliary confocal ellipsoid. Other than many practical applications in geological engineering, the displacement solution can be a convenient starting point to derive the deformation gradient, and subsequently in a straightforward manner to accomplish the full-field solutions of the strain and stress. Following Eshelby's definition, a complete set of the Eshelby tensors corresponding to the displacement, deformation gradient, strain, and stress are expressed in explicit analytical form. Furthermore, the jump conditions to quantify the discontinuities across the interface are discussed and a benchmark problem is provided to validate the present formulation.

To study the mechanical properties and crack development, 12 coal samples with moisture contents of 0, 2.37, 3.78 and 5.29 % were prepared for acoustic emission tests under uniaxial compression. Over about 6 days, the coal samples absorbed moisture from a humidifier in three different phases. In this period, uniaxial tests show that the peak stress, elastic modulus, strain softening modulus and post-peak modulus decreased with rising moisture content in the samples while the peak strain increased. It was further found that, by analysing the relationship between the stiffness and stress and the accumulated acoustic emission counts, all the phases of crack development can be evaluated. This is useful for studying the effect of water intrusion on crack propagation and for calculating the mechanical properties of the coal such as the elastic modulus. This investigation also quantifies the percentage of the stress thresholds for crack closure, crack initiation, and crack damage that constitutes the peak stress. These stress thresholds do not change with moisture content. Our results are of great significance for water storage in coal mines, for determination of pillar dimensions in coal mines, and for expanding the knowledge base of the mechanical properties of coal and the characteristics of crack propagation. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.","Acoustic emission; Coal; Crack propagation; Mechanical properties; Stress threshold; Water intrusion","Acoustic emissions; Coal; Coal mines; Coal storage; Crack closure; Crack propagation; Cracks; Elastic moduli; Groundwater; Knowledge based systems; Mechanical properties; Mercury (metal); Moisture; Moisture determination; Stresses; Crack development; Effect of water; Engineering problems; Strain-softening; Stress thresholds; Uni-axial compression; Uniaxial tests; Water intrusions; Acoustic emission testing; acoustic emission; coal mine; crack propagation; elastic modulus; engineering geology; mechanical property; moisture content; rock mechanics; softening; stiffness; uniaxial test; water storage","Chen, T.; School of Mines, Key Laboratory of Deep Coal Resource Mining, Ministry of Education of China, China University of Mining & TechnologyChina; email: tianchen_cumt@163.com",,"Springer-Verlag Wien",07232632,,RMRED,,"English","Rock Mech Rock Eng",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987596914

Recent earthquakes that hit Iran such as on May 11, 2013, caused tremors and mild shaking of buildings in some UAE cities. Although the tremors are small in magnitude, their sequences apparently become an important research topic and deserve more assessment from different perspectives such as geographical, geological, engineering, and social. This is because low risk does not equal no risk. This study is concerned with public perceptions of earthquake preparedness (reduction of disaster impact) that can be measured by various variables such as developing an emergency plan, preparation of disaster supply kits, and training. The methodology consists of a survey of 470 people who live around the Masafi area, near Fujairah city, UAE. GIS and GPS were used for site selection in conducting the survey, and remote sensing was used as an aid in identification of buildings’ ages. Results show that around 90% of the people surveyed have water tanks that can support them up to 3 days, and 60% of them normally buy food that can support them up to 2 days. Thirty percent of the respondents were familiar with storing first-aid kits and tools such as flashlights. The findings point to a need for more research regarding public awareness about earthquakes. The findings of this study may be useful for people who are involved in the four cornerstones of disaster risk reduction: community participation, public policy actions, safer construction and urban development, and development of a culture of prevention. © 2016, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Earthquake; Public awareness; UAE",,"Yagoub, M.M.; Department of Geography and Urban Planning, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, UAE UniversityUnited Arab Emirates; email: myagoub@uaeu.ac.ae",,"Springer Verlag",18667511,,,,"English","Arab.

The process of their formation is interpreted to be via the ice process. The name, the silt mushroom comes from their figurative form. This is because they look somewhat similar to mushroom's in size and shape; being in the range of 1 to 10 cm in diameter, with the medium 3-5 cm, and on average 10 cm in height, occuring generally in groups, and occasionally in isolation in relatively soft silt. They develop in the transition from winter to spring, and are convincingly related to ice processes. Ice-induced silt mushrooms are best examined in association with the many other newly discovered ice-induced sedimentary structures (over 20 kinds). Clearly, up to now, ice processes have been significantly underestimated. With the substantial discovery of the ice-induced silt mushroom, it opens up new questions. This is because its structure mirrors the same sedimentary structures found in rocks, questioning their genesis, and sedimentary environment analysis.

By PFC (Particle Flow Code) modeling, this paper aims at understanding the damage mechanism of the multi-peak deformation behavior of jointed rock mass with different joint orientations and continuity factors under uniaxial compression observed in the physical model tests. With the smooth joint contact model, not only has the inherent roughness in conventional joint model been avoided, but also we can monitor the joint aperture, number of closed joints, and forces acting on the joints during the damage process. It is shown that mobilization of joint strength plays an important role in the multi-peak deformation behavior of rock mass. If the joint strength is slightly mobilized or immobilized (i.e., most joints keep open) during the test, strain softening occurs. However, if the joint strength is significantly or fully mobilized, yielding platform or strain hardening may happen. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Joint geometry; Joint strength mobilization; Jointed rock mass; Multi-peak deformation behavior; Smooth joint contact model","Deformation; End effectors; Hydraulic fracturing; Rock mechanics; Slope stability; Strain hardening; Deformation behavior; Joint contact modeling; Joint geometry; Joint strength; Jointed rock mass; Rocks; compression; deformation; flow modeling; geometry; model test; numerical model; rock mass response; uniaxial strength","Chen, X.; State Key Laboratory for Geomechanics & Deep Underground Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing)China; email: chx@cumtb.edu.cn",,"Elsevier B.V.",00137952,,EGGOA,,"English","Eng.

Their capabilities under 42 modelling scenarios with different combination of 9 conditioning factors were tested and compared using the performance metric of area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The results showed that all the models could acceptably produce landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) with the achieved AUC of 86.05, 85.89, 87.65 and 85.63% for model training, and that of 86.03, 85.7, 86.4 and 85.11% for model validation. Slightly, ANN was best, followed by LR, IVM and SVM. The LR showed a better generalization capability under the circumstances of changing combination of the conditioning factors, whereas the performance of ANN and SVM appeared to be sensitive to that. Although the comparable performance (i.e. AUC) could be achieved by all the models, the hazard zones classified from the produced LSMs exhibited considerable variation in spatial patterns. The IVM tended to overestimate the landslide susceptibility compared to others, and predicted a less area at very low-level hazard.

Vast amount of geological information gathered in the digital archives and databases of Polish Geological Survey (PGS) is a basic resource for multi-scale national subsurface management. Data integration is the key factor to allow development of GIS and web tools for decision makers, however the main barrier for efficient geological information management is the heterogeneity of data in the resources of the Polish Geological Survey. Engineering-geological database is the first PGS thematic domain applied in the whole data integration plan. The solutions developed within this area will facilitate creation of procedures and standards for multilevel data management in PGS. Twenty years of experience in delivering digital engineering-geological mapping in 1:10 000 scale and archival geotechnical reports acquisition and digitisation allowed gathering of more than 300 thousands engineering-geological boreholes database as well as set of 10 thematic spatial layers (including foundation conditions map, depth to the first groundwater level, bedrock level, geohazards). Historically, the desktop approach was the source form of the geological-engineering data storage, resulting in multiple non-correlated interbase datasets. The need for creation of domain data model emerged and an object-oriented modelling (UML) scheme has been developed. The aim of the aforementioned development was to merge all datasets in one centralised Oracle server and prepare the unified spatial data structure for efficient web presentation and applications development. The presented approach will be the milestone toward creation of the Polish national standard for engineering-geological information management. The paper presents the approach and methodology of data unification, thematic vocabularies harmonisation, assumptions and results of data modelling as well as process of the integration of domain model with enterprise architecture implemented in PGS. Currently, there is no geological data standard in Poland. Lack of guidelines for borehole and spatial data management results in an increasing data dispersion as well as in growing barrier for multilevel data management and implementation of efficient decision support tools. Building the national geological data standard makes geotechnical information accessible to multiple institutions, universities, administration and research organisations and gather their data in the same, unified digital form according to the presented data model. Such approach is compliant with current digital trends and the idea of Spatial Data Infrastructure. Efficient geological data management is essential to support the sustainable development and the economic growth, as they allow implementation of geological information to assist the idea of Smart Cites, deliver information for Building Information Management (BIM) and support modern spatial planning. The engineering-geological domain data model presented in the paper is a scalable solution. Future implementation of developed procedures on other domains of PGS geological data is possible.",,"Architectural design; Boreholes; Data integration; Database systems; Decision making; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Earth sciences; Economics; Engineering geology; Geographic information systems; Geological surveys; Geology; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Maps; Mineral resources; Remote sensing; Societies and institutions; Applications development; Decision support tools; Enterprise Architecture; Geotechnical information; Object oriented modelling; Spatial data infrastructure; Spatial data management; Spatial data structure; Information management; data management; database; decision support system; dispersion; economic growth; geological mapping; geotechnical survey; GIS; research work; spatial data; spatial planning; sustainable development; Poland [Central Europe]",,"Yilmaz I.","Institute of Physics Publishing",17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

In this discussion, important drawbacks associated with the newly proposed 3P-W model were outlined.

The proposed analytical concept is primarily intended to replace the current conventional graphical method by providing consistent-error free results.

Evaluation of geological risk is difficult and costly due to the uncertainties and complexity of subsurface structures and multiple interrelated factors among structures. In order to reduce time and cost in preparatory process, it is common for risk manager to regard the structures as similar ones for excavation in repeated geological sections and the changes of time and cost are linear in tunneling risk estimations for huge excavation projects; however the interdependencies of risk contributing parameters and their sensitivities in the overall geological risk assessment remain unknown. Aimed at the sensitivities of various risk contributing parameters including excavation length, ground type arrangement and excavation method and their corresponding effects, sensitivities and volatilities of these parameters in risk assessment were determined by Monte Carlo simulation. The geologic model and scenarios adopted in this paper are based on relevant assumptions obtained through geologist's consultations and relatively conventional geotechnical structures. Uncertainties were quantified in terms of excavation cost and advancement rate to facilitate the integration of multiple factors which can be used in geotechnical risk evaluation. The sensitivity of each parameter in the evaluation can be determined through simulating different scenarios. The results show that ground condition and excavation length are independent parameters. The sequence of geological arrangement has insignificant effect on excavation length and cost when excavation is carried out under different geological conditions with equal lengths. This assessment also demonstrates that the variations of length and cost are of non-linear risk relationship for tunnel excavation in repeated geological profiles. This paper contributes to an evaluation system for decision maker in assessing and managing possible risks so as to finalize the best possible decision in huge highly complex tunneling projects. ï¿½ 2016, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

The lattice Boltzmann method was first validated using two benchmarks: Newtonian flow through a square cross-section tube and Bingham flow through a circular cross-section tube. Afterward, the dam-break problem for the Newtonian fluid and the slump test for Bingham fluid were simulated to validate the free-surface-capturing algorithm. The numerical results were in good agreement with analytical results, as well as other simulations, thereby proving the validity and correctness of the current method.

Based on the analysis of the harm on underground pipes induced by ground fissure, full-scale model test was carried out to study the force condition, deformation and failure modes of underground pipeline crossing the active ground fissure. The model test results show that whichever layout mode of underground pipeline is (riding or joint riding across ground fissure), the stress on the pipeline is sophisticated and pipeline is in tension and compression simultaneously. The deformation and failure modes of pipeline can be divided into two kinds that one is reverse bending-elastic foundation beam failure mode, the other is terminal warping-cantilever beam failure mode. The critical value of ground fissure dislocation leading to crack failure of underground pipeline is 6cm. For pipeline riding across ground fissure, cracks mainly appear in the range of 0.5 m from the position of ground fissure at foot wall. As to pipeline with joints riding across ground fissure, cracks mainly appear at the spot with a distance of 1.2 m from ground fissure at the hanging wall. So keeping a certain distance from the ground fissures and reasonable planning should be adopted for the underground pipeline construction in ground fissure developed areas. As for underground pipelines crossing the ground fissures, the necessary countermeasures such as shallow buried pipe ditch, overhead setup, flexible pipes, joint reinforcement, underground corridor and monitoring and early warning etc. should be taken to avoid and prevent the crack failure of pipelines induced by active ground fissure. The conclusions can be presented as the reference to plan of new pipeline network and old network reconstruction in Xi'an city and also to pipeline engineering construction of other developed areas of ground fissures. © 2016, Science Press.

It is an important factor which influences the stability and instability of the geological engineering. Due to the long geological tectonic setting and geological evolution, the in-situ stress field is a function of time and space, thus it is very difficulty for us to make accurate inversion the in-situ stress field. Taking Jinchuan mine as the engineering background and with the aid of in-situ stress measurement in Jinchuan mine, the in-situ stress field was inverted. First the 3D numerical mode of geological engineering body in Jinchuan mine was established, and the relation between in-situ stress and rock mass parameters and coefficients of horizontal pressure was obtained by orthogonal numerical analysis and genetic programming (GP). Then the optimization mode was established which takes the sum of squares of differences between the measured initial stress and calculation initial stress up to the minimum value as the objective function. The rock masses parameters and coefficients of horizontal pressure would been obtained by solving the optimization model using genetic algorithm. Finally, the initial stress field can be obtained when the 3D numerical analysis is carried out again by inputting the parameters of rock masses and coefficients of horizontal pressure. Based on comparing inverting in-situ stress with the measured values for the 4 gauging points, the maximum and minimum error of the principal stress is 16% and 0.62% respectively. The results show that the method of intelligent inversion of in-situ stress field can be applied for complicated geological engineering body to simulate in-situ stress field and the accuracy meets the engineering demand. © 2016, Harbin Institute of Technology.

The total area of the studied district are 4 km2, and 20 ground fissures were interpreted with 11 principal ground fissures and 9 secondary ground fissures. Some of those ground fissures were interpreted as the outcrop on the surface, while some dip all the way down to the bedrock. The ground fissures are line-like distributed from plane view with a dominant orientation of NEE.

It is also the direct cause of many engineering and environmental problems, however, this issue has never been taken into account in geoengineering disciplines. Based on the recent research achievements on soil moisture evaporation in other disciplines, the advances of some important aspects on this topic, i. e. soil moisture evaporation capacity determination, test method, evaporation process, influencing factors and theoretical model, are summarized and shown as follows: (1) To accurately determine the actual evaporation capacity of soil is one of the most important tasks in soil moisture evaporation study. Generally, there are two categories of methods: theory calculation and direct measurement; (2) To carry out evaporation test is an important approach to understand soil moisture evaporation process and the related mechanism. There are two categories of tests: laboratorial test and in-situ test. As compared, evaporation test by environmental chamber has better application prospect; (3) Soil moisture evaporation process can be divided into three stages: constant rate, falling rate and residual rate phases; (4) The factors influencing soil evaporation can be categorized as internal soil factors and external environmental factors. The former one mainly affects soil moisture transportation characteristics, and the latter one mainly influences evaporation energy supply intensity; (5) Many soil moisture evaporation calculation and prediction models have been proposed, however, they show some disadvantages such as large errors, narrow range of adaptation or difficulties on parameters acquisition.

The failures of those slopes have encouraged the studies on deformation and failure mechanisms of such artificial slopes. In this research, a high sticking slope failure is used as a case study. Based on the in-situ investigation and geological engineering survey, the stratigraphic structure features and impact factors of slope stability are analyzed. According to the analysis results, the corresponding laboratory tests are conducted, such as compacted loess wetting compression tests, deeply buried Q2loess collapsibility tests, and loess triaxial tests with CTC and RTC stress paths. The deformation and failure mechanisms of high loess sticking slopes are studied from the in-situ and laboratory test data. The results indicate that the fluctuation of bed stratum causes various fill thicknesses, which further induce differential settlements and cracking on the slope shoulder. Water infiltration into the crack will then trigger deformation and failure. The failure mode of high sticking slopes is summarized: the differential settlement induced by consolidation of compacted loess and collapse of Q2loess under high pressure causes cracks of slope shoulder→water infiltration into cracks softens the compacted loess→the initial sliding surface forms in the middle of slope→the front part of loess fails under wetting CTC stress path→the back part of loess fails under wetting RTC stress path→the locking section loess failes under wetting CTC stress path→the whole slope fails. These results are helpful for understanding the formation and evolution of failure of high loess sticking slopes, and may provide technical support to the treatment of loess slope stability. © 2016, Chinese Society of Civil Engineering.

In this paper, the evaluations on shale gas sweet spots conducted in Zhaotong demonstration zone in the past six years and the construction of 500 million m3 shale gas production capacity in Huangjinba region were discussed, and the results of shale gas reservoir evaluations in China and abroad were investigated. Accordingly, it is proposed that another two key indicators be taken into consideration in the evaluation on shale gas sweet spots in marine mountains in South China, i.e. shale gas preservation conditions and pore pressure, and the research on ground stress and natural microfracture systems be strengthened. Then, systematic analysis was conducted by integrating shale gas multidisciplinary data and geological and engineering integration study was carried out. Finally, a 3D model, which was composed of ""geophysics, reservoir geology, fracture system and rock geomechanics"", was established for shale gas reservoirs. Application practice shows that the geological engineering integration and the 3D reservoir modeling are effective methods for evaluating the shale gas sweet spots in complex marine mountains in South China. Besides, based on shale gas sweet spot evaluation, 3D spatial congruency and superposition effects of multiple attributes and multiple evaluation parameters are presented. Moreover, the short-plate principle is the factor controlling the distribution patterns and evaluation results of shale gas sweet spots. It is concluded that this comprehensive evaluation method is innovative and effective in avoiding complex geological and engineering risks, so it is of guiding significance in exploration and development of marine shale gas in South China. © 2016, Natural Gas Industry Journal Agency.

The program provides students with a 2 yr international fi eld experience, which helps to educate an adaptable, interculturally competent geoscientist. The challenges of conducting research while serving in the Peace Corps often provide opportunities for substantial learning and growth. A multiple-year evaluation of the PCMI program (2005-2013) suggests substantial impacts on students' professional confi dence and career aspirations. These conclusions are supported by data drawn from an objective-based evaluation of the Remote Sensing for Hazard Mitigation and Natural Resource Protection project, which supported the PCMI students. Instruments employed in the project assessment include the Intercultural Development Inventory, exit surveys, individual qualitative interviews, postparticipation tracking, and a comparison group survey. The small participant population and relatively short project duration, however, limit the defi nitiveness of the conclusions and how broadly they can be applied. These fi rst 10 yr of this unique program have provided many lessons on the administration of a nontraditional international master's degree program, including the diffi culties of applying research to international development, funding, and advising students serving abroad in the Peace Corps.

However, no related research was conducted in the Xishan coal field. Geological characteristics of the coal reservoir in the B3 area, Xishan coal field, were analyzed. In this study, the B3 area was divided into the west and east subareas according to the different effects of burial depth on gas content. Geological, engineering, and draining parameters were extracted to compare with gas production. The results show that, in both subareas, draining parameters play the most important role in controlling gas production. Among geological parameters, gas content and permeability have much more significant effects on gas production. In shallow buried subarea (the east subarea), the effects of resistivity and the difference of stop pressure and drop pressure (Ps-Pd) on gas production are much notable than other parameters, which reflects permeability is a dominating factor for controlling well productivity. Regions with low resistivity, high Ps-Pd, and high water level are favorable regions for gas development in shallow buried subarea. However, water production and gas content determine the well productivity in deep buried subarea (the west subarea), in which, high gas content and water production, low water level are much helpful for producing gas. ©: The Author(s) 2016.","B3 area; Gas production; Gray model; Parameters; Xishan coal field","Coal; Coal bed methane; Coal deposits; Firedamp; Gases; Geology; Methane; Natural gas wells; Productivity; Water levels; B3 area; Gas productions; Gray Model; Parameters; Xishan coal fields; Gas permeability","Zeng, F.; Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Taiyuan University of TechnologyChina; email: m15735162787@163.com",,"SAGE Publications Inc.",01445987,,EEEXD,,"English","Energy Explor Exploit",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84986575601

A multi-variant regression has been used to established relationship between the modulus of deformation of the rock mass and the pillar strength for various pillar shapes and sizes.

Pore network micromodeling is able to provide an effective way to experimentally observe the gas-liquid displacement phenomena. However, micromodel experiments were rarely conducted in heterogeneous conditions, which may significantly affect the displacement process. In this study, CO2/water displacement experiments were conducted at 25 °C and ambient pressure conditions in an etched glass micromodel with heterogeneous pores and throats. The experiments were performed in both vertical and horizontal directions with the CO2 injection rates ranging from 0.2 ml h-1 to 6.0 ml h-1. Dynamic displacements were detected in real time by a digital single lens reflex camera. Based on the experimental results, a detailed discussion about the instability of CO2 front and CO2 saturation variation was conducted. It is found that the displacements become more and more unstable with an advancing CO2 front. Small fingerings can be collapsed by capillary pressure. Micro-scale heterogeneity significantly influenced the flow pattern at both the microscale and macroscale. Moreover, we created a new evaluation parameter Seval to characterise CO2 saturation variations and the transformation of Seval agrees well with our experimental results of CO2 saturation. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Cameras; Carbon dioxide; Digital cameras; Flow patterns; Porous materials; Digital single lens reflexes; Displacement experiments; Displacement process; Dynamic displacements; Evaluation parameters; Gas - liquid two-phase flows; Heterogeneous conditions; Micro-scale heterogeneity; Two phase flow","Liu, Y.; Key Laboratory of Ocean Energy Utilization and Energy Conservation, Ministry of Education, Dalian University of TechnologyChina; email: liuyu@dlut.edu.cn",,"Royal Society of Chemistry",20462069,,RSCAC,,"English","RSC Adv.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981313750

The work was divided into two parts: geological engineering investigations (mapping of the external borders of the landslide) and geodetic surveying (photogrammetric studies and monitoring of surface movements). The boundaries of the landslide were marked using a Garmin eTrex GPS receiver and a geological compass (Freiberg). The boundaries have not changed and is convergent with previous studies. In the south-western part of the landslide the boundary is blurred as a result of anthropogenic transformation of the area. In the south-eastern part (as at May17, 2014) about 200 m3 of the colluvial material has been moved. Photogrammetric studies were based on the analysis of aerial photos from May 26, 2009 (prior tothe landslide formation) and on the orthophotomap created from images taken in July 2010, after the formation of the landslide. Displacement vectors were determined by comparing the locations of specific terrain details in the pictures taken before and after the mass movements occurred. In the upper part of the landslide the maximum horizontal displacement value was 87.7 m, the minimum was 6.2, and the average - 84.5 m. In the lower part of the landslide the horizontal displacements amounted to 65.5 m, had a minimum value of 10.3, and an average of 54.8 m. In the last stage of the study the base measurement network was created. It consisted of 68 points stabilized in the ground. The measurements were performed using the static GNSS observations method and linear-angular measurements carried out with a precise total station. In 2013, horizontal displacements ranged from 1 to 8.1 mm, and vertical ones ranged from -9.8 to 13.5 mm. In 2014, there were displacements observed in the vicinity of the main slope. They were directed to the south. The horizontal displacement vector has reached values from 2 to 94 mm, and the vertical vector was from -63 to 16 mm.","Flysch carpathians; Geodetic monitoring; Kłodne; Landslides","displacement; engineering geology; geodesy; GPS; landslide; photogrammetry; surveying; Carpathians; Poland [Central Europe]",,,"Polish Geological Institute",00332151,,,,"Polish","Prz.

To make a geostructure identification unbiased and for the appropriate decision-making, an expert studies immense number of geological characteristics presented as 3D models. However, the modern programs on mining and geological engineering lack tools for automated identification of geostructures. The authors suggest using 3D models of Micromine's software. A deposit is divided into geometrized parts (blocks) with nominally uniform properties of rocks, and data on these blocks are then processed. It is feasible to use artificial neural networks for the analysis. Having reviewed the ANN methods, the authors recommend Kohonen's self-organizing network for automated clustering of coal fields. As a result, the authors have formulated an integrated model for identification of geostructures in 3D block model of coal fields for automated substantiation of rational project solutions. The model for identification of geostructures in a coal field has three constituents: input geological data; 3D model of the coal field based on the data from mining and geological information system; selforganizing neural network for data clustering. The operation of identification of geostructures was tested. As a test subject, a coal bed site 800×800 m in area was chosen. The test trial discovered two geostructures. Mining in geostructure 1 is expedient by up-dip longwalling, considering high water content and average thickness of the coal bed, and mining in geostructure 2 is better to implement along the strike. Verification of the efficiency of the procedure proposed for clustering coal bed reserves allows a conclusion on feasibility of the objective automated identification of geostructures to make mining easy and safe. Thereunder, the model of identification of geostructures was constructed for a coal bed in Severnaya Mine, SUEK-Kuzbass. The model showed a single data cluster, which is an evidence of a single geological structure accommodating all coal reserves of the bed, and this was confirmed in actual mining. Thus, the introduction of integrated identification of geostructures in 3D model of coal fields allows delineating mine areas with uniform parameters, suitable for mining with monotechnology.

The porosity was determined for various lithotypes of hard coal, collected in different areas of the Upper-Silesian Coal Basin. Samples of hard coal were collected in 60 seams of 16 coal mines, from the depth of approximately between 350 and 1200 m. There are also presented differences in values of open porosity of coal depending on the depth of occurrence, as well as chronostratigraphic and tecto­nic correlation of a seam. Uniaxial compression strength of the tested coals falls in the strength class from very low to very high (from 8.1 to 51.5 MPa), open porosity is 0.68–12.5% and total porosity is 3.29–17.45%. With an increase in depth, in general, open porosity of coals decreases. There is an apparent decrease in open porosity correlated with the age of hard coals. It was observed that the lower and upper limits of open porosity ranges of variability shift towards lower values the older the coals are, from the Łaziskie Beds to the Jaklowieckie Beds. The older the coals the greater the average drop in the share of open porosity in total porosity from 60% for the youngest coals to merely several per cent for the oldest ones. The highest values of total porosity (over 10%) were observed in the youngest coals (Cracow sandstone series and siltstone series). Older coals reached more diversified values of total porosity (3.29–17.45%). Based on the conducted tests, zones correlated with tectonics of the basin and with deposition of lithostratigraphic beds of specific age, where values of porosity of hard coals differ, were determined in the area of the USCB. However, in spite of their correlation to a structural unit, the coals demonstrated a decrease in open porosity with an increase in their geologic age. Thus, there is an apparent influence of the deposition depth of coal within a given structural unit on open porosity following the age of coal, i.e. correlation to an older and older chronostratigraphic unit. Porosity tests of hard coal are published in scientific journals yet, most often, there is no infor­mation on the type of porosity. Such detailed characteristics of open porosity for coal of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, as in the article, have not been prepared yet, making our research novel. Such broad tests of porosity of hard coals, correlated with their strength and referring to the deposition depth of seams as well as a correlation to lithostratigraphic units within individual structural units in the USCB, had not been conducted yet. We believe it is a sufficient argument to start detailed research into the open porosity of hard coals. The results of the tests are important from both the research and practical points of view. Knowledge of coal porosity is indispensable in solving many engineering problems of geological engineering, mining geomechanics and mining e.g.: assessing behaviour of coal when it is mined and processed, assessing the possibility of capturing methane, which makes up over 90% of natural gas, from coal in the areas of methane-rich deposits; the possibility of storing various substances in abandoned hard coal mining areas (e.g. CO2 storage within the structure of coal), assessing risk of occurrence of certain natural hazards resulting from mining deposits (e.g. coal and rocks outburst hazard), as well as assessing the possibility of applying unconventional methods of mining hard coal deposits (e.g. underground coal gasification). © 2016, Polska Akademia Nauk.

In accordance with the fundamental principles of the Particle Flow Code (PFC), various models were established to investigate the crack propagation patterns and energy evolution rules of coal in disturbed zones of hydraulic slotting for various lateral pressure coefficients. Cracks around a slotted borehole propagate in the horizontal direction when the lateral pressure coefficient λ is less than 1, distribute uniformly when λ is equal to 1, and extend mostly in the vertical direction when λ is greater than 1. The total number of cracks increases linearly with λ. The variation in kinetic energy for coal failure was recorded; kinetic energy evolution observes a similar rule and its process can be divided into four stages, namely, the quick-release, rapid dissipation, drastic fluctuation, and stabilized stages. The peak value of the kinetic energy increases linearly with λ. The acoustic emission events distribute discretely when λ is small and uniformly when λ is equal to 1. The variation in acoustic emission events tends to increase sharply before decreasing when λ is greater than 1.

However, current studies have focused on the analysis of statistical parameters, while the intrinsic link between the macroscopic phenomena and the mesoscopic mechanism has been ignored. The macroscopic and mesoscopic mechanical characteristics and the mechanism of deformation failure in the direct shear tests were systematically analyzed with the discrete element method(DEM). According to the development of shear stress ratio under the different normal stresses during the shearing process, anti-friction properties of granular material were discussed from the perspective of particle movement. A synchronic development between the anisotropic parameters of fabric and the macro-scale stress ratio was found. Through the statistical analysis of particle rotation, the friction between particles was revealed to be an important factor to maintain the relative stability of the mesoscopic structure. The morphological analysis of the networks of force chains revealed an agreement between the direction of principle stress and the principle direction of anisotropy. The decrease of the force chain intensity and the increase of porosity during the shearing tests were discovered. Two main mechanical models of force chain structures under different normal stresses were proposed. The fluctuation of macro-scale mechanical parameters was explained with the stability of system and the cumulative release of energy, showing the microscopic mechanism of deformation localization and dilatancy. ©, 2015, Academia Sinica.

To understand the mechanics and transport properties of fluid through a fractured rock in detail and to quantify the sources of non-linearity in the discharge and base pressure relationship, fluid flow experiments were carried out on a cylindrical sample of granite containing a ‘single rough walled fracture’. These experiments were performed under varied conditions of confining pressures, σ<inf>3</inf> (5–40 MPa), which can simulate the condition occurring about 1,000 m below in the earth crust, with elevated base pressure, b<inf>p</inf> (up to 25 MPa) and by changing fracture roughness. The details of the methodologies involved and the observations are discussed here. The obtained results indicate that most of the data in the Q verses b<inf>p</inf> plot, fall on the straight line and the flow through the single fracture in granite obeys Darcy’s law or the well-known “cubic law” even at high value of b<inf>p</inf> (=4 MPa) and σ<inf>3</inf> (=5 MPa) combination. The Reynolds number is quite sensitive to the b<inf>p</inf>, σ<inf>3</inf> and fracture roughness, and there is a critical b<inf>p</inf>, beyond which transition in flow occurs from laminar to turbulent. It is believed that such studies will be quite useful in identifying the limits of applicability of well know ‘cubic law’, which is required for precise calculation of discharge and/or aperture in any practical issues and in further improving theoretical/numerical models associated with fluid flow through a single fracture. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Wien.","Confining pressure; Fluid flow; Non-linear flow; Rockmass; Single fracture","Fracture; Granite; Reynolds number; Rock pressure; Structural geology; Transport properties; Confining pressures; Cylindrical samples; Engineering project; Laboratory simulation; Nonlinear flow; Rock-mass; Rough-walled fractures; Single fracture; Flow of fluids; confining pressure; Darcy law; flow modeling; fluid flow; fracture mechanics; fracture network; granite; hydrogeology; laboratory method; numerical model; Reynolds number; rock mass response; rock mechanics","Singh, K.K.; Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Powai, India",,"Springer-Verlag Wien",07232632,,RMRED,,"English","Rock Mech Rock Eng",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928330501

In this study, numerical simulation was performed to confirm that the number of rock-mass fracture surfaces also obeys a three-dimensional fractal distribution. A simulation model is proposed here for the three-dimensional fractal distribution of the number of rock-mass fracture surfaces. Random distributions of fracture surfaces (RDFS) can be divided into three types: heavy random, weakly random, and distributed by group. By extensive calculations and theoretical deduction, the relation of the three types RDFS between the 3D fractal dimension (DS) of the fracture surfaces and the fractal parameter (DL) of the fracture trajectory in a 2D profile, DL= DS-. 1, has been derived. It has further been proved that the 2D fractal dimension (DL) is not related to the initial value of the fracture-surface distribution. The initial value of the 2D fractal distribution (NL) shows a linear relation with the initial value of the 3D fractal distribution (NS), NL= kNS, where k is determined by the projection relation between the rock-mass profile and the 3D fracture surface.The program developed in this research to simulate fractal analysis of rock-mass fractures and the correlation between 2D and 3D fractal characteristics could facilitate study of the fracture-trajectory distribution on any rock-mass profile and that of the fracture surfaces in any subblock.

Such treatment is necessary to enable risk assessments which are now required by emerging risk based coastal zone management/planning frameworks. While unresolved issues remain, relating to the availability of sufficient data for comprehensive uncertainty assessments, this will hopefully improve in coming decades. Here, we present a modelling framework which integrates geological, engineering and economic approaches for assessing the climate change driven economic risk to coastal developments. The framework incorporates means for combining results from models that focus on the decadal to century time scales at which coasts evolve, and those that focus on the short term and seasonal time scales (storm bite and recovery).

The study shows the capability of electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) to identify key subsoil features that might affect a future tailings dam slated for construction at the Zaruma-Portovelo Mining District, Ecuador. The ERI profiles were gathered and processed with the aim of obtaining resistivity images of a sufficiently resolution for geotechnical use. A geophysical model was created based on these images. The resistivity images were calibrated according to geomorphological, hydrogeological and geotechnical data in order to translate geophysical information into rational geological information. The ERI results, supported by the geomorphological and geotechnical work, suggested that the rock massif is composed of weathering horizons of different rock qualities, slopes are affected by sliding surfaces and these features exert a control on the groundwater flow. These results indicated that the original site selected to construct the dam dike was susceptible to land sliding and an alternative construction site was suggested.

Pit slope angles may control economics; therefore, open-pit mine design utilizes a reliability approach that specifies confidence interval, precision index, and practical strength values. The geological model for economic evaluation is developed before pit slope stability analyses are undertaken and is based on lithology and mineralization, both of which are essential for the geological engineering model. The preliminary mine plan includes a shell for the ultimate pit based on assumed pit slope configuration that includes haul-road benches. Geological engineering characterization utilizes the geological model to identify locations for geotechnical bore holes and detailed mapping of rock structure to document aspects critical for slope stability. Uncertainty is common; rock structure variability is represented from direct observation of selected outcrops and from detailed logging of rock core. Lithologies that form the ultimate pit walls are sampled for unconfined compression testing. Samples of a single lithology from different bore holes reflect formation variability. Typically, a few (3-15) samples of each lithology are tested. The desired precision index and reliability may not be met for a specified confidence interval with a limited program; these parameters cannot be determined until test-result variability is known. Geological uncertainty may be managed for open-pit mines by using practical strength values, drilling a few additional bore holes, and performing additional unconfined compression tests. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Confidence interval; Practical strength value; Precision index; Reliability",,"Munro, R.; AMEC Americas, Inc, 6001 Rickenbacker Road, United States",,"Springer International Publishing",,9783319090603; 9783319090597,,,"English","Engineering Geology for Society and Territory - Volume 6: Appl.

Research present monitoring for 23 Carpathian landslides and 8 counteraction projects. Implemented instrumentation besides standard monitoring methods included automatic on-line measurements with real-time transfer of landslide data to the Internet. The initial site investigations were funded under the Landslide Counteraction Project (2005-2009). Standard monitoring measurements was financed by author and Poltegor-Institute (2006-2015). Real-time measurements were realized inside the EU Innovative Economy Programme (2008-2013). These measurements are conducted and financed by the author till now. The instrumentation consists of 26 standard inclinometers to depths of 5-21 m. Up to Fifty five series of measurements performed 4-9 times a year from 2006 till now detected displacement from several millimetres to 49 cm. These were observed at depths of 1-17 m. Modern automatic, early warning, real time system was installed in May 2010. The system is the first of its kind in Poland and one of several such a systems in the world. The installation was carried out in consultation with the Local Road Authority in Gorlice. It contained three automatic field stations investigating landslide parameters to the depths of 12-16 m and the weather station. The displacements were measured by in-place inclinometers, and innovative 3D continuous inclinometer systems with sensors located every 0.5 m. It has possibility to measure much greater range ofmovements compare to the standard systems. The obtained data allowed better recognition of geohazards triggering parameters and control of landslide stabilization works. It included definition of risk conditions. The early-warning about the risk to the road owner and the Carpathian Branch of Polish Geological Survey were implemented. Chosen monitoring methods and numerical modelling could help in forecasting of the landslide movement for estimation of remediation possibilities and improve effectiveness of stabilization works. However, landslide stabilization works are usully difficult and should be connected with control monitoring measurements.","Engineering geology investigations; Landslide monitoring systems; Landslide stabilization","displacement; early warning system; European Union; landslide; monitoring system; slope stabilization; instrumentation; numerical model; site investigation; environmental monitoring; forecasting method; Beskid Niski; Beskydy Mountains; Beskydy Mountains; Carpathians; Gorlice; Malopolskie; Poland [Central Europe]","Bednarczyk, Z.; Instytut Górnictwa Odkrywkowego, Poltegor-Instytut, ul.

Main purpose of this research is to analyze the fractures because of their importance and effect on the implementation of engineering and civil engineering projects such as Khansar-Boien Miyandasht tunnel. For this purpose, the process and density of the fractures and their spatial-geometric position were investigated. Therefore, joints and faults in the Khansar syncline area and the site of Khansar-Boien Miyandasht tunnel were collected, then processed by interpreted in the software such as Stereo32 and Georient. According to the result, a group of joints can be related to pre-tectonics, another one can be related to syn-tectonics(folding and faulting) and some fractures are related to the post-tectonics. Geomechanically, syn-tectonic fractures are extensive in depth and these issues are very important, so it should be considered in implementing the project of Khansar tunnel. Results of the geological engineering study such as, uniaxial strength test, point loading, Schmidt hammer, and ultra-sonic Test were showed high-resistance massive orbitolina limestone, and alternation of shale, limestone, medium- resistance limestone and black slates include low resistance that lead to apply the supports with higher safety factor.

Apart from the deformation modulus, internal friction angle and cohesion that are conventionally determined in compression and single-plane shear testing using standard procedures, the estimation involved loading-relaxation modulus and secant modulus under triaxial compression, shear modulus under failure, secant modulus of a specimen with 50% strength under pure shear (cutting) and an odometer overconsolidation ratio. The listed characteristics are required for numerical simulation of complex object foundations using various complexity models of soils, such as Coulomb- Mohr and hardening soil models, with the help of Plaxis software tools. The test benches allowed automated-mode determination of the complete spectrum of deformation and strength characteristics of soils with output data recording at any frequency. The authors have derived correlation dependences between deformation and strength characteristics and physical properties of marine and glacial loam soil, as well as related the odometric modulus of deformation, loading-relaxation modulus and secant modulus. It is revealed that calculation of piling foundation subsidence in accordance with the current standards uses the value of shear modulus that is valid for soil with the load-bearing capacity outspent by more than 50%. The calculations with the use of the derived relations and correlation dependences for marine and glacial loam soil will considerably reduce the scope and cost of geological engineering survey in architectural engineering.","Deformation modulus; Glacial deposits; Hardening soil model; Marine deposits; Overconsolidation ratio; Shear modulus; Strength characteristics",,,,""Ore and Metals" Publishing house",00172278,,,,"Russian","Gorn.

Besides, the ranges of specific energy values in weathered rock and structural rock mass of soil layer/scattered, cracked and intack granite are determined. The classification standard of diamond drilling specific energy for geo-formation is formulated and verified by in-situ drilling tests. The specific energy values are 0.0017~0.6955 kN·m/cm3 for the soil layer and scattered structure, 0.0258~0.9798 kN·m/cm3 for the cracked rock and 0.0018~2.4935 kN·m/cm3 for the intack rock, respectively.

After the fabricating process of the geogrids is detailed, finite element (FE) simulations are conducted to analyze the strain distribution of geogrids and the strain transfer characteristics from geogrids to fiber optic. Results indicate that FBG should be deployed in the middle of the geogrids rib to make sure that uniform strain distribution along the FBG. Also, PVC protective sleeves, which are used to protect fiber optic when integrated with geogrids, have smaller strain transfer loss than nylon sleeves. Tensile experiments are conducted to test strain measurement performance of proposed geogrids, and the results demonstrate that proposed smart geogrids have good linearity and consistency. Temperature experiments show that FBG embedded in geogrids has higher temperature sensitivity, and the temperature induced error can be compensated by an extra FBG strain-independent sensor. Furthermore, designed smart geogrids are used in a geotechnical model test to monitor strain during tunnel excavation. The strain tendency measured by smart geogrids and traditional strain sensor agree very well.

In common methods, only two characteristic parameters (dip and dip angle) are selected to identify discontinuity sets. Trace length, joint opening and surface morphology of discontinuities also influence the mechanical behaviors of rock mass. Therefore, a novel scheme for discontinuities classification is proposed based on multivariate parameters and artificial bee colony algorithm. The sum of deviations squares of the entire sample data is taken as an objective function. The artificial bee colony algorithm is used to search the optimal solution which makes the objective function achieve the minimum value. The optimal solution is the cluster centers. On this basis, a mathematical model is established. At the same time, the boundaries between different sets are determined automatically. The validation of the novel scheme is proved by results based on artificial data. The calculation precision of the method is satisfactory. Finally, the proposed method is applied to multivariate parameter dominant partitioning of discontinuities of rock mass at Songta dam site on the NuJiang River.

The ladder-shaped displacement curves are generally observed in actual landslide monitoring; and the changing points on the curve represent the mutation points of landslide deformation. To investigate the deformation characteristics at the mutation points in landslide, a series of rheological tests is carried out on natural samples under different loading levels and on immersion samples under different loading levels and with different water contents. The curves of accumulative deformation vs. time and deformation velocity vs. time are obtained. Based on the Qin's locking section theory and the landslide early warning model with inverse-velocity method, the experimental results are analyzed. The results show that the model parameters are independent of the loading level and water content, and are the functions of material properties. The deformation characteristics of mutation points in deformation process are similar to those at failure, and the model parameters of the landslide early warning model based on the inverse-velocity method at mutation point are identical to those at failure point. Hence the model parameters determined by the early mutation point in landslide monitoring curve can be utilized in the early warning for landslide failures. ©, 2015, Academia Sinica.

Thus, the adoption of the Rayleigh wave method to address this problem is investigated in this study. The fundamental of the Rayleigh wave velocity method in geological engineering is initially presented. The in situ shear wave velocity can be obtained by Rayleigh wave method. Rayleigh wave velocity and soils static load tests are conducted on several different kinds of soil. Thus, the fitting formula between shear wave velocity and soil bearing capacity under specific soil conditions is determined. A reconstruction engineering project that uses the Rayleigh wave velocity method to test the bearing capacity of soil under a constructed building is then studied. Rayleigh wave velocity tests are conducted based on this fitting formula to analyze the soil bearing capacity. The reconstruction is proven to be successful by settlement observation. The fitting formula between shear wave velocity and soil bearing capacity are probably different for various kinds of soil. Therefore, the application of the wave velocity test method in detecting the soil bearing capacity of a constructed building has to be studied before it can be popularized.

The landslide was then modeled along the most representative section of the study area by considering its mechanism, the parameters determined from the geotechnical investigations, the size of the landslide, and the location of the slip circle. In addition, pseudo-static stability analyses were performed comprising the earthquake potential of the site. The most suitable slope remediation technique was decided using the surface and subsurface conditions.

Results are compared to routine core analysis (RCA) available for similar samples. The volumetric distribution, quality and connectivity of different contrasting types of elementary flow units [microlithofacies (μLFs)] are individually evaluated for a highly heterogeneous Pembina Cardium lithofacies. Reservoir properties were measured/calculated at a sub-centimeter scale for a core sample using a combination of x-ray computer tomography, pressure decay profile permeability, and image analysis techniques. The derived high-resolution porosity, permeability, and/xLFs distribution represents the primary input to a single phase flow model. This model was used to simulate whole-core steady-state tests from which absolute permeability for different orientations was derived. Several simulation sub samples with random location and volume are also selected for evaluation of the effect of scale/composition on the calculated permeability. The core sample evaluated exhibits three dominant rock types and a bimodal permeability within the microdarcy (μLFs SS2 + SH1) and millidarcy ranges (μLFs SS1). The calculated (from whole core simulation) vertical and horizontal permeability values are in good agreement with actual RCA measurements from offset cores. Despite relatively good reservoir quality associated with/xLFs SS1, results from the full diameter core simulation demonstrate that its limited volumetric abundance and restricted connectivity prevent this rock type from dominating the fluid flow process in these rocks. In fact, permeability seems to be dominated by the tighter encasing matrix (μLFs SS2 + SH1), which exhibits average permeability values very close to those reported from routine core analysis. The methodology used in this work is particularly applicable to the detailed characterization of reservoir rocks with high degree of heterogeneity associated with biological reworking and/or selective diagenetic imprints. The model incorporates statistical variations for several key geological/engineering parameters and offers a direct comparison to results obtained from laboratory measurements.

The main aim of the study is to identify engineering-geological conditions in the valley of river Bolshaya Aleksandrovka according to the results of engineering surveys and determination of features of formation of the Neogene-Quaternary deposits of the territory. The methods used in the study: methods of engineering-geological researches: surface observation, drilling; complex laboratory methods for determining physico-mechanical properties of rocks: determination of granulometric composition of cohesive and non-cohesive sedimentary rocks, density and bulk density calculation of porosity, moisture content and the maximum molecular moisture capacity, plasticity, stickiness, swelling and other; methods for determining petrophysical properties of igneous rocks: density, bulk density, water saturation, water absorption, humidity, capillary rise, porosity, strength and elastic properties; geophysical methods of vertical electrical sounding and seismic exploration by the method of refracted waves; direct methods of correlation of ground sections, based on the study of cores and the mapping of columns in different wells; stratigraphic method. The results. As a result of geological engineering survey the authors have compiled geological section of seven kilometers to the bottom of the valley of the river Bolshaya Aleksandrovka, located in the central part of Sakhalin island. The conditions of formation of the upper part of the section were identified and engineering-geological elements and their spatial position were selected. The authors zoned the valley territory by the totality of sediments characteristics and variability of the individual parameters in different parts of the section. It was ascertained that since the Upper Pliocene time the bottom of the valley of river Bol. Aleksandrovka was subjected to sustainable lift. The authors determined the break in the alluvium between stations 31-47, which is caused by the washing of a new straightened river channel at the runoff from higher terraces, with edge level on the height of 12 m, to a lower one, with the surface level of 4-6 m above sea level. The formation of the lowest marine terraces of abrasion-accumulative genesis is associated with post-glacial transgression, occurred near 7-9 ka BP, when the sea went inward into the valley of Bol. Aleksandrovka on 5-7 km. Formation of terraces with surface level of 12-15 m can be explained by the ocean level rise at significant glacioeustatic transgressions in Late Pleistocene.","Accumulation; Endogen factor and exogenous factors; Engineering-geological surveys; Erosion; Sediment transporting; Space remote sensing",,,,"Tomsk Polytechnic University, Publishing House",25001019,,,,"Russian","Bull.

The decision greatly leverages propositions formulated by the National Forum of Geology Courses (FNCG) and come to meet the concerns and desires of university teachers, professionals and students. There is a certain perception by the national community of Geosciences that vocational training in Geology seeks to supply a field of activities typically linked to the state. This fact emphasizes the importance of clear rules for operation of undergraduate courses in Geology and Geological Engineering. This article examines implications of NCGs for higher education of Geology. It is noticed that many recommendations of previous guidelines - from the model of the Minimum Curriculum - were maintained. The guidelines may lead courses to be restructured, curricula to be reviewed and concepts to be changed, with emphasis on fieldwork as a central tool for the training of geologists. The NCGs can lead to innovative teaching projects, which will replace more rigid models of curricula and course loads. The main expected result is to have more well-prepared professionals, but we can predict that there will be better interaction with professional regulatory bodies and more effective guidelines for the periodic evaluation of the courses. © 2014 LNEG - Laboratório Nacional de Geologia e Energia IP.","Curricula; Higher education; Innovation; Pedagogical project; Professional regulation","curriculum; engineering geology; geology; guideline; higher education; innovation; Brazil","Carneiro, C.D.R.; Inst.

The objective of this study is to analyze the effects of hybrid learning environments on student performance in engineering courses by comparing traditional lecture methods with hybrid methods in parallel over the same academic year. Half of the students in the study course experience a hybrid «flipped» classroom while the other half participate in traditional lecture delivery. Hybrid students watch online video lessons, read selected texts, and take quizzes before coming to class each week for a problem-solving session lead by the instructor. Group problem solving is emphasized while the instructor acts as a guide for learning in this student-centered, modeled-learning approach. Over the course of the study, student tool use was tracked and students participated in surveying and focus group sessions to identify effects on student achievement, time, and preference between hybrid and traditional methods of learning. In this paper, methods and preliminary results from the study in the 2012-2013 academic year are presented, along with anecdotal experiences on student performance, perception, and preferences, as well as the implications for sustainability. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Students; Sustainable development; Teaching; Engineering course; Engineering educators; Hybrid learning; Hybrid method; Postsecondary education; Problem-solving sessions; Student achievement; Student performance; Engineering education",,,"American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)",08950563,9780784413272,GSPUE,,"English","Geotech Spec Publ",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906823727

Comprehensive and systematic evaluation for engineering geologic characteristics of residual soil on basalt is necessary to the construction in this area and geological engineering investigation. Kaolinite is dominant in clay mineral of this soil, which has a higher clay particle content. The special material composition and structural morphology make it have the physical properties of high porosity, low density and high water content. But it has mechanical properties of higher strength. The soil has a low expansibility and weak water-resistance. Moreover, the soil is sensitive to environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. The mechanical properties become weak after soaking, leading to a larger collapse deformation and a heavy disintegration. Therefore, it is important to focus on the engineering disasters caused by rain water for example. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Basalt residual soil; Biwei highway; Engineering characteristics","Disasters; Kaolinite; Mechanical properties; Soils; Biwei highway; Clay particle content; Engineering characteristics; Environmental factors; Geologic characteristics; Geological engineering investigation; Residual soil; Temperature and humidities; Basalt",,,"Trans Tech Publications Ltd",16609336,9783038351658,,,"English","Appl.

This information can be provided by seabed MT (natural source EM field) or seabed logging (MCSEM). These techniques are fairly well developed for relatively deep water but depths of less than 200m, and particularly less than 20m, cause certain difficulties. Both AUSS systems (10-200m) are designed to reduce the influence of induced noise when deployed in shallow marine environments. The main advantage of these systems is their low weight, which allows them to be deployed from relatively small vessels. A unique feature of the 5-component (2E+3H) system is the automatic leveling of the platform and, most importantly, of all three magnetic sensors at the seabed, which allows accurate measurement of a vertical magnetic component. The SMMT system (0-50m) has a very low profile, aerodynamic shape not affected by currents and waves, and a unique recovery system that does not leave an environmental footprint on the seabed unlike common industry practice.

Under the impact of global climate change and the surge in extreme weather events, rapid and accurate equipment or procedures for geological engineering surveys are necessary to harmonize engineering facilities with natural environment. This study utilizes 3D laser scanning technology (also known as ground LiDAR), which obtains the coordinates of surface geometry rapidly in point clouds, to survey two outcrops. Applying ground LiDAR in a geological survey, we compare the results with those provided by the International Society of Rock Mechanics, and analyze the slope stability. This study also discusses the applicability and limitations of ground LiDAR technology in discontinuity investigation and estimation of rock mass engineering characteristics. Suggested operating procedures for the use of ground Li- DAR technology in outcrop surveys are provided accordingly. The results show that ground LiDAR technology reduces the in-situ operation time significantly, thus facilitating efficient discontinuity surveys and outcrop parameters evaluation. However, the quantities of office work and the accuracy of point clouds depend on the velocity and accuracy of ground LiDAR surveys. Therefore, inspection of survey results and output parameters, along with the application and operating specifications of geological surveys, including point cloud resolution, reasonable error of superimposition, inspection procedures and data analysis, still await further research.","Engineering parameter estimation; Highway slope; LiDAR; Rock discontinuities; Rock engineering; Site investigation","discontinuity; extreme event; geological survey; geotechnical engineering; global change; lidar; motorway; outcrop; parameterization; rock mechanics; site investigation; slope stability","Wang, T.-T.; Institute of Mineral Resources Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan; email: ttwang@ntut.edu.tw",,"Chinese Soil and Water Conservation Society",02556073,,,,"Chinese","J.

Hence, the existing method for estimating GSI is not suitable for rock samples from drilled cores. Inspired by the GSI estimation method of flysch (Marinos and Hoke, Proceedings of the GeoEng2000 at the international conference on geotechnical and geological engineering, Melbourne, Technomic publishers, Lancaster, pp 1422–1446, 2000), this paper proposes two parameters, the rock mineral condition and rock core length, for use in a modified, more quantitative method for estimating GSI. This modified method can be used for granite specimens from drilled cores. It uses images of typical core samples instead of the sketches given by Hoek’s GSI estimation method. A modified chart of GSI for granite, which is suitable for estimating mechanical parameters of rock mass from drilled core samples, is then developed. The E (elastic modulus) and Qult(ultimate bearing capacity) values obtained using our modified method were compared with those from experimental data; the results indicate that the modified method can produce reasonable GSI values and can be used to estimate the mechanical parameters of rock mass from drilled cores. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Geological Strength Index (GSI); Granite; Quantification; Rock core length; Rock mineral condition","Bearings (machine parts); Core samples; Estimation; Geology; Granite; Minerals; Rock mechanics; Rocks; Estimation methods; Geological strength index; Mechanical parameters; Quantification; Quantitative method; Quantitative parameters; Rock core; Ultimate bearing capacity; Parameter estimation","Yuan, R.Huayanli A1#, Chaoyang District, China",,"Springer Verlag",14359529,,,,"English","Bull.

Successfully delineation of geological boundary of Bukit Arang Tertiary Basin in the east of Perlis and north of Kedah illustrates its usefulness as an efficient geological mapping tool. In higher accuracy measurements, the microgravity method has been widely and successfully used for locating and monitoring subsurface voids. Since microgravity methods measure gravity variations at the surface, they are directly influenced by the density distribution in the subsurface and particularly by the presence of voids, which create a mass deficit relative to the density of the surrounding terrain. In many cases, deep or small-scale heterogeneities generating low-amplitude anomalies can be detected and the reliability of further interpretation requires highly accurate measurements which are carefully corrected for any quantifiable disturbing effects. Most of the microgravity surveys in Malaysia were carried out by the Mineral and Geoscience Department mainly to detect the occurrence of subsurface cavities in limestone areas of Klang Valley in Federal Territory and Kinta Valley in Perak. Results of the sinkholes occurrences studies at the sites of a proposed public library building in Baling, Kedah and at the compound of the KTM Quarters, Ipoh, Perak showed that the low amplitude of gravity values located exactly or slightly adjacent to the sinkhole positions. Good correlation of borehole data with several results of microgravity survey such as at Mahkota Wira Condominum site, Jalan Sultan Azlan Shah, Ipoh, Perak and at the proposed Light Rail Transit Station in Jalan Ampang, Kuala Lumpur showed that the cavity location can be successfully determined by the microgravity measurement technique. Although the gravity method can be used successfully in locating the subsurface targets but it's still a non-unique interpretation and the results need to be confirmed either by drilling or by other geophysical methods. © 2014 ejge.","Cavity detection; Geological mapping; Gravity survey; Malaysian case studies","Cavity detection; Geological mapping; Gravity survey; Malaysians; Case-studies; Environmental investigation; Geological boundaries; Microgravity measurement; Small-scale heterogeneity; accuracy assessment; cavity; detection method; geological mapping; gravity survey; limestone; sinkhole; data interpretation; drilling; environmental monitoring; landfill; subsoil; Malaysia; Kedah; Kuala Lumpur [West Malaysia]; Perak; Perlis; West Malaysia; Geological surveys; Geology; Geophysics; Landforms; Libraries; Light rail transit; Location; Mapping; Microgravity; Microgravity processing; Soils; Surveys; Gravitation",,,"E-Journal of Geotechnical Engineering",10893032,,,,"English","Electron.

Accordingly facies identification from well logs and cores data information is considered as the most prominent recent tasks of geological engineering. The aim of this study is to analyze and compare the five artificial neural networks (ANN) approaches with identification of various structures in a rock facies and evaluate their capability in contrast to the labor intensive conventional method. The selected networks considered are Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNN), Radial Basis Function (RBF), Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN), Competitive Learning (CL) and Learning Vector Quantizer (LVQ). All these methods have been applied in four wells of South Pars field, Iran. Data of three wells were employed for the networks training purpose and the fourth one was used to test and verify the trained network predictions. The results have demonstrated that all approaches have the ability of facies modeling with more than 65% of precision. According to the performed analysis, RBF, CL and LVQ methods could model the facies with the accuracy between 66 and 68 percent while PNN and BPNN techniques are capable of making predictions with more than 72% and 88.5% of precision, respectively. It can be concluded that the BPNN can generate most accurate results in comparison to the other type of networks but it is important to note that the other factors such as consuming the amount of time taken, simplicity and the less adjusted parameters as well as the acquired precisions should be considered. As a result, the model evaluation analysis used in this study can be useful for prospective surveys and cost benefit facies identification. © 2014, Geological Society of India.","Facies identification; Neural Network methods; Oil/Gas reservoir characterization; South Pars field-Iran","artificial neural network; comparative study; facies analysis; gas field; hydrocarbon reservoir; learning; lithology; Arabian Sea; Indian Ocean; Iran; Persian Gulf; South Pars Gas Field","Kakouei, A.; School of Chemical Engineering, College of Engineering, University of TehranIran",,"Geological Society of India",00167622,,,,"English","J.

It also argues that the classification of capacity estimates should follow concepts in the existing SPE Petroleum Resource Management System (PRMS) (SPE 2007) as closely as possible. The paper takes the discussion of CO2-storage capacity significantly further. It also aligns storage-capacity definitions more closely to the widely accepted PRMS. Numerous authors and organizations have proposed CO2-capacity classification and calculation systems. In most of them, there is a definition ofCO2-storage capacity that is intended to parallel the definition of petroleum reserves-namely, the volume of hydrocarbons that can be commercially recovered from known accumulations from a given date. However, each of the proposed systems applies economics only at the highest classifications of their systems. This is attributed to the infancy of the carbon-capture-and-storage (CCS) industry and/or the lack of a carbon price. However, in this paper, we demonstrate how economics combined with analytical and numerical injectivity modeling on the basis of geological models of the subsurface can help determine practical storage capacity. In doing this, the paper makes observations about methods for estimating storage capacity, shows results of reservoir simulations and economic analyses, draws on SPE and internationally accepted methodologies and definitions of petroleum resources, and discusses how equivalent definitions can be applied to storage capacity. Finally, the paper provides recommendations for an improved CO 2-storagc-capacity classification system.

There is always uncertainty in making such estimates, the level of uncertainty is affected mainly by the Quantity and quality of the geological, engineering, and geophysical data, the magnitude of uncertainty however, decreases with time until the economic limit is reached and the ultimate recovery is realized. Experimental (ED) design techniques are increasingly been adopted as a standard, to consistently combine the uncertain parameters to construct a range of reservoir models to evaluate recoverable volumes. However, ED technology is a time and resource consuming workflow, requiring a suite of static and dynamic models to be generated and a full history matching process to be applied, however, when a project team is time constrained full ED approach, should be limited to only those reservoirs which have a maturity less than 70% and capture 90% of the impact to total remaining recoverable volumes. Traditional deterministic simulation methods, calculate ultimate recovery based on the assumption that all input parameters are exactly known, however they sometimes ignore the variability and uncertainty in the input data which creates inherent problems resulting in over pessimistic or optimistic numbers.

We studied the problem of how to select a safe and economic slope ratio by analyzing the geological condition of the high slope, including the lithology, slope structure, structural surface and their combinations, rock weathering and unloading, hydrology, and the natural gradient. The study results showed that the use of an excavation gradient larger than the gradient observed during site investigation and the gradient recommended in standards and field practice manuals is feasible. Then, we used the finite element method and rigid limit equilibrium method to evaluate the stability of the excavation slope under natural, rainstorm and earthquake conditions.

There are common methods for facies boundaries detection which come with many difficulties and errors. All of the presented methods work well when the change of lithology at formation boundary is sudden. However, in the cases that change of lithology is gradual these methods may not work accurately. The methods which use Artificial Neural Networks classification capability are among these common methods. In this paper Artificial Neural Networks function estimation capability is used to develop a new method for formation boundaries detection. In this method the gradual and sudden changes of lithologies is considered separately. The exact boundary depths of some layers in S13 oil field was determined by using image logging measurements and core and drilling cutting analysis and the developed method was examined by using obtained data. The results show that the new approach works perfectly in either gradual or sudden change of lithology.

In the next stage, marls were classified by using the RMR, Q and GSI systems and rock mass properties were determined. In the final stage, the stability of the tunnel, planned to be excavated in the marls, was investigated by using the criterion of Singh et al. (1992), Goel et al.

We focus on granite from Beishan region, a potential future nuclear waste repository site in our country. The scanning electron microscope(SEM) high temperature test system has been employed to investigate three-point bending fracture behavior of Beishan granite after heat treatment. In the range of 25°C-100°C, Beishan granite exhibits mainly brittle failure. Under low stress, crack propagation is mainly controlled by the coupled effects of stress concentration, minerals mechanical behavior and the adhesive force among mineral particles. The final crack initiation normally occurs along the weaker cemented surface between the mineral particles. Crack initial spreading angle usually has an included angle with the horizontal plane. With the increasing loads, cracks gradually propagate along the horizontal direction. This is due to the direction subjected to the maximum bending tensile stress. However, the tensile strength of the rock is usually low. The average fracture toughness of Beishan granite does not almost change from room temperature to 100°C. Slight fluctuations may be due to mineral inhomogeneity. Based on digital speckle correlation calculation method, the full deformation field of rock at mesoscopic scale has been successfully measured. The measurement results obviously indicate that the surface deformations of mineral particles are very complicated. The results of the interface of mineral particles moving toward two different directions indicate the particles are subjected to tensile stress. Though the deformation occurs mainly along the surface subjected to the maximum bending tensile stress in the initial stage, the final failure may occur in the other places. At this case, the failure process is mainly affected by nonuniform weak surface. Therefore, rock failure at meso-scale is obviously affected by the coupled effects the maximum stress state and inhomogeneous deformation of local mineral particles.","Beishan granite; Fracture toughness; Meso-failure mechanism; Rock mechanics; Scanning electron microscope(SEM); Thermal-mechanical coupling","After-heat treatment; Beishan granites; Digital speckle correlation; Inhomogeneous deformation; Nuclear waste repositories; The scanning electron microscopes (SEM); Thermal-mechanical coupling; Thermo-mechanical coupled; Behavioral research; Bending (deformation); Cracks; Failure (mechanical); Fracture mechanics; Fracture toughness; Granite; Heat treatment; Radioactive waste disposal; Rock mechanics; Rocks; Scanning electron microscopy; Stress concentration; Tensile strength; Tensile stress; Minerals","Zuo, J.; State Key Laboratory of Coal Resources and Safe Mining, China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing 100083, China; email: zjp@cumtb.edu.cn",,,10006915,,YLGXF,,"Chinese","Yanshilixue Yu Gongcheng Xuebao",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891929018

Liangshuijing landslide in Yunyang County in this area is just a case. The impoundment water level of Three Gorges Reservoir was 135 m in 2003, 156 m in 2006 and reached 175 m in 2009. The effect of such a large variation of reservoir level on the deformation and stability of Liangshuijing landslide is not negligible. It once suffered from a dangerous situation due to the influences of various factors such as water level variation and rainfall. Based on the geological exploration, a thorough analysis of the deformation status and geological engineering situation of Liangshuijing landslide is made, and the formation and instability mode of the landslide are also judged. Based on the limit equilibrium analysis method, the stability of axial profile of the landslide is studied under three kinds of extreme conditions (impoundment water level of 145, 175 m and drawdown of 175-145 m). Three-dimensional finite element numerical calculation is then adopted to study the deformation of the landslide under the above conditions based on the hydro-mechanical coupling numerical model. The quantitative calculations reveal that the variation of groundwater level caused by the variation of reservoir level is the main factor for the landslide resurrection, especially under the third condition of rapid drawdown. It is recommended to continue monitoring the landslide so as to further understand the deformation trend of the landslide under the influences of water storage. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.","hydro-mechanical coupling; Liangshuijing landslide; stability; variation of reservoir level","Geological exploration; Hydromechanical coupling; Limit equilibrium analysis; Quantitative calculation; Three dimensional finite elements; Three gorges reservoir area; variation of reservoir level; Water level variations; Convergence of numerical methods; Deformation; Groundwater; Reservoirs (water); Stability; Water levels; Landslides","Wang, H.L.; Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Coastal Disaster and Defence, Hohai University, Nanjing, China; email: whl_hm@163.com",,,19648189,,,,"English","Eur.

The results show that if the axes and surround dynamic load ratio k is small, the change of k influences loess strength limitedly, but along with the increase of k, the bigger dynamic stress is needed to produce certain deformation, and if k>1, with the increase of deviatonic stress, the smaller dynamic stress is needed. In addition, action of earthquake load will damnify the framework of loess and reduce its strength in condition of lower concretion pressure, and the degree of strength reduction increase with the increase of amplitude of dynamic load, but if the sample is in condition of higher concretion pressure, the bigger dynamic load will make the sample denser, so as to produce bigger residual deformation but the shear strength will be increased.","Dynamic triaxial test; Geological engineering; Loess; Stochastic seismic load; Strength of loess","Attenuation relationships; Degree of strength; Dynamic triaxial tests; Exceedance probability; Loess; Residual deformation; Stochastic seismic loads; Strength of loess; Deformation; Dynamic loads; Seismology; Stochastic systems; Sediments","Deng, L.-S.; School of Geology Engineering and Geomatics, Chang'an University, Xi'an 710054, Shaanxi, China; email: deng32120@yahoo.com.cn",,,16718879,,,,"Chinese","Chang'an Daxue Xuebao",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886604253

Rock can be broadly classified into intact rock (without any discontinuities) and rockmass (with discontinuities). In case of hard and crystalline rockmass, major flow occurs through the fractures only not through the matrixes. Any civil and geological engineering activities are associated with the hard and crystalline rockmass and therefore understanding of the mechanics and transport of fluids through a fractured rockmass becomes mandatory. Also for the exploration of oil and natural gas, disposals of nuclear or radio-Active waste and carbon dioxide sequestrations, investigations on permeability of the rockmass is essential. Earlier researchers have worked on the behavior of fluid flow through the rockmass considering the geometry of fractures (orientation, length, density, and connectivity), roughness of the fractures; aperture of the fractures and on the states of stresses and found that due to change in these parameters, the fluid flow through the rockmass affects significantly. In the present study, authors have compiled the articles or earlier research dealing with the permeability of the fractured rockmass and presented the critical synthesis of the literature herein.

To determine regularities of the soil properties variability occurred in the past. Analyzing data concerning the properties of loess unstable to the anthropogenic impact we have made back calculations of spatial variability of its properties. Methodology: We have selected the representative data, identified the variables, and performed analysis of the variability of geotechnical properties. Heterogeneity and variability of the physical and mechanical properties of sagging soils at different levels of study of the massif are caused by change of paleo-geomorphic conditions occurred during its formation and by modern conditions. The most accurate mathematical model should reflect the complex variability of properties in spatial coordinates. We used the most reliable method of stochastic mathematical modeling to create the mathematical model. Findings: The results of loess soil properties variability modeling on the basis of a random process model is presented in the article. The random model identification has been carried out by means of well-known method widely used in economic processes study. On the example of two natural-anthropogenic systems similar by geological conditions we have simulated variability of peri-glacial formation soil properties affected by anthropogenic impacts of low intensity. Originality: We have proved the applicability of the Markov Process Model for description of the sequence of geotechnical properties at different levels of study of the geological environment. The increase of anthropogenic influence affects the form and parameters of the model of a random sequence. We have obtained the model of steady process and non-stationary random motion with drift. We have determined the presence of the chaotic state of the geological environment in the zone of the local anthropogenic system (city). Practical value: The theory and practice of stochastic modeling of variability of geotechnical properties of the soils in the area affected by urban buildings will improve the accuracy and validity of the geological engineering predictions.","Autocorrelation; Loess; Properties; Random motion; Technogenesis","Anthropogenic disturbance; Anthropogenic influence; Geotechnical properties; Loess; Physical and mechanical properties; Properties; Random motions; Technogenesis; Autocorrelation; Markov processes; Mathematical models; Sediments; Soil testing","Mokritskaya, T.P.; Oles Gonchar Dnipropetrovsk National University, Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine; email: mokritska@i.ua",,,20712227,,,,"Russian","Nauk.

The change of microstructure affects the geological engineering properties of soils causes problems with the foundation of buildings. The volumetric changes of cohesive soils, containing significant amounts of clay minerals from the smectite group, are caused by a variable water content in soil. The phenomenon of the moisture change significantly alters the geological engineering properties of these soils as a result of shrinking and swelling. This paper aims at presenting the microstructural changes in remoulded specimens of Neogene clays caused by loss of moisture due to suction pressure. The scientific examination involved quantitative analyses of the microstructure using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to study pore space details of remoulded specimens. Tested samples from selected levels of the Neogene clays (Poznan Series) were collected from the Warsaw-Stegny area. Samples were taken from a research polygon for these clay soils. The basic geological engineering properties of clay soils and remoulded specimens have been examined after being prepared according to strictly defined procedures. Through successive stages of the suction pressure (from 50 to 1600 kPa), the samples underwent the process of loss of moisture. Application of a novel method of sample preparation procedure for remoulded specimens allowed examining structurally homogeneous soils and obtaining results without an effect of material anisotropy. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of soil microstructures were performed using SEM and STIMAN software for quantitative images processing. The analysis allowed determination of the number of geometric and morphometric parameters of the microstructure with high accuracy. Based on this study, significant qualitative and quantitative changes in loss of moisture due to suction pressure in the process of remoulded specimens were noted along with changes in the microstructure and pore space of clay soils. The obtained results showed the effect of successive stages of ""closing"" of the structure of cohesive soils.

One of the most commonly employed detection technologies is to shoot videos of a borehole using a forward moving camera. Using this technology, the problem of stratum structure detection is transformed into the problem of constructing a panoramic image from a low quality video. In this paper, we propose a novel method for creating a panoramic image of a borehole from a video sequence without the need of camera calibration and tracking. To stitch together pixels of neighboring image frames, our camera model is designed with a focal length changing feature, along with a small rotational freedom in the two-dimensional image space. Our camera model assumes that target objects lie on a cylindrical wall and that the camera moves forward along the central axis of the cylindrical wall. Based on these two assumptions, our method robustly resolves these two degrees-of-freedoms in our camera model through KLT feature tracking. Since the quality of the result video is affected by possible illumination overflow, camera lens blurring, and low video resolution, we introduce a cost function for eliminating seams between stitching strips. Our cost function is designed based on Markov Random Field and optimized using a belief propagation algorithm. Using our method, we can automatically construct a panorama image with good resolution, smoothness, and continuousness both in the texture and illumination space. Experiment results show that our method could efficiently generate panoramas for long video sequences with satisfying visual quality. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Belief propagation algorithm; Forward moving camera; MRF optimization; Panorama","Belief propagation algorithm; Detection technology; Markov Random Fields; Moving cameras; Mrf optimizations; Panorama; Rotational freedom; Two-dimensional images; Algorithms; Cost functions; Markov processes; Optimization; Structural frames; Video recording; Cameras","Yang, C.; School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, China; email: chl_yang@sdu.edu.cn",,,01782789,,VICOE,,"English","Visual Comput",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876475223

In the last two decades, 54 micro-dam reservoirs have been constructed in Northern Ethiopia to fight the recurrent drought and improve agricultural productivity through irrigation. However, about 60% of these micro-dam reservoirs are suffering from excessive leakage. Comprehensive studies have been carried out on two micro-dams to assess and pinpoint the causes of leakage. Arato and Hashenge micro-dams located in Northern Ethiopia have 20m and 19m height, and 2.59Mm3 and 2.23Mm3 reservoir capacities respectively. Observational geological description, shallow hand dug test pits, vertical electrical sounding and drilling of geotechnical holes were used to understand the overall geological, engineering geological and geo-hydrological set-up of the area. The different methods applied, such as discontinuity analysis, geophysical surveys, drilling and packer tests, delivered results that were found to be in close agreement and led to the identification of the leakage zone. The geological units found in both sites are limestone-shale-marl intercalation, dolerite and recent soil deposits. The research results revealed that the limestone-shale-marl intercalation unit is heterogeneous and shows alternating sequences. Analysis of the different data shows that the limestone-shale-marl intercalation is a pervious unit (hydraulic conductivity in the range of 10-4-10+2cm/s) and was found to be responsible for the excessive leakage of the micro-dams. It is hoped that the observations, data and insights gathered from these case studies will enable to plan technically and economically viable anti-leakage measures for these schemes and help for future new site selection and design activities in the region and other regions with a similar geological environment. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Engineering geology; Leakage; Micro-dam; Northern Ethiopia; Reservoir","dam; engineering geology; geophysical survey; hydraulic conductivity; hydrogeology; leakage; reservoir; sedimentary sequence; testing method; Ethiopia","Berhane, G.; Department of Earth Sciences, College of Natural and Computational Sciences, Mekelle University, P.O.

Hypogene karst is one of the fundamental categories of karst, at least of equal importance with more familiar epigenic karst. Hypogene and epigenic karst systems are regularly associated with different types, patterns, and segments of flow systems, which are characterized by distinct hydrokinetic, chemical, and thermal conditions.Hypogene speleogenesis is the formation of solution-enlarged permeability structures by water that recharges the cavernous zone from below, independent of recharge from the overlying or immediately adjacent surface. It develops mainly in leaky confined conditions, although it may continue through unconfined ones. Hydraulic communication along cross-formational flowpaths, across lithological boundaries, different porosity systems, and flow regimes allows deeper groundwaters in regional or intermediate flow systems to interact with shallower and more local systems, permitting a variety of dissolution mechanisms to operate. A specific hydrogeologic mechanism acting in hypogenic transverse speleogenesis (restricted input/output) suppresses the positive flow-dissolution feedback and speleogenetic competition seen in the epigenic development.Hypogenic caves occur in different soluble rocks in a wide range of geological and tectonic settings, basinal through orogenic. Overall patterns of cave systems are strongly guided by the spatial distribution of the initial (prespeleogenetic) permeability features and hydrostratigraphic barriers and interfaces within the soluble and adjacent units, by the mode of water input to, and output from, cave-forming zones and by the overall recharge-discharge configuration in the multiple aquifer system. Because of their transverse nature, hypogene caves have a clustered distribution in plan view, although initial clusters may merge laterally across considerable areas. Hypogene caves display remarkable similarity in their patterns and mesomorphology, strongly suggesting that the type of flow system is the primary control.The rapidly evolving understanding of hypogene speleogenesis has broad implications for many applied fields such as prospecting and characterization of hydrocarbon reservoirs, groundwater management, geological engineering, and mineral resources industries. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Rock and soil's parameter is very crucial in geological engineering, the soil parameters were determined by parameter back analysis theory and the stress and deformation characteristic for vertical loading piles were analyzed by the improved shearing displaces law. These process was simulated by my own program. The calculation results show that the axial force of pile decreases with pile depth and the pile tip axial force is zero. The pile bottom resistance increases with load and the soil's resistance increases with the relative displacement between pile and soil. But, the frictional resistance growth rate with displacement is different in different soil. The silt's growth rate is minimum and the medium-fine sand mixed mucky soil is maximum.

The case study concerns the landslide in the east of Latian Dam to the northeast of Tehran, the Capital of Iran. The methodology was based on geological studies, geomorphologic studies, the study of landslide phenomenon including its characteristics and its parameters, hydrogeology, geological engineering and the geotechnical studies. The results show that landslide is located in the crush and mylonitized zone of the Roodehen active fault. The geological formation includes the landslides of the Eocene tuffs, which have been severely crushed and pulverized by the Roodehen Fault's actions, and for this reason, they show very weak geotechnical characteristics compared to the natural tuffs. The layering slope of the formation is according to the natural ground slope and facilitates their slips. According to the results, the main reason for landslide is the impact of the Roodehen active fault and the creation of crush and mylonitized zone in the Eocene tuffs, while the secondary parameters are the local geological structures, the unfavorable conditions of the groundwater and their inadequate drainage and the construction of a road along the ground layers. The existence of groundwater, the low impermeability of the landslide materials and the inadequate drainage are also under the influence of the fault. Moreover, based on the results of this research and the location of the considered landslide and a number of others along the Roodehen Fault, it became possible to study the fault's activity from a seismotectonic point of view and to estimate the magnitude of such an eventuality by methods other than the conventional ones. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Faults impact; Iran; Landslide phenomena; Latian","Faults impact; Geological formation; Geological structures; Geotechnical characteristics; Geotechnical studies; Iran; Latian; Seismotectonics; Drainage; Groundwater; Hydrogeology; Landslides; Research; Faulting; active fault; engineering geology; geomorphology; geotechnical engineering; hydrogeology; landslide; seismotectonics; tuff; Iran; Tehran [Iran]; Latia","Khorsandi, A.; Power and Water University of Technology (PWUT), P.O.

This paper aims to demonstrate the working of the framework in deriving probabilistic coastal hazard lines. Within the framework, means for combining results from models that focus on the decadal to century time scale (geomorphic), and those that focus on the short term and seasonal time scales (storm bite and recovery) have been developed. This combination is necessary for the derivation of probabilistic hazard lines. The Narrabeen - Collaroy embayment on the northern beaches of Sydney was chosen as an appropriate study site due to its data rich nature, with directional wave records extending back 20 years, and ongoing repeated beach survey available since the mid 1970's. The site has been subject to extensive study over recent decades. To demonstrate operation of the framework two models with stochastic capabilities were adapted for use in the study. These are the Shoreface Translation Model (STM), for century scale geomorphic evolution, and the Joint Probability Method - Probabilistic Coastline Recession (JPM-PCR) for shorter term beach erosion and recovery. Both models are introduced and discussed. When projecting forward to future scenarios involving sea level rise, the framework also enables sea level rise over time to be input as a probabilistic variable. Recent research has also provided some guidance as to how this can be achieved using outputs from the most recent IPCC estimates. Overall, the research efforts have aimed to point a way forward that enables the quantitative assessment of coastal hazard likelihood for use in robust coastal risk assessment. This contrasts with present practice which typically adopts a more qualitative approach to risk assessment.","Coastal hazard; Probabilistic modelling","Beaches; Climate change; Hazards; Sea level; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Coastal hazards; Geomorphic evolution; Joint probability method; Modelling framework; Probabilistic modelling; Qualitative approach; Quantitative assessments; Translation models; Risk assessment",,,"National Committee on Applied Mechanics",,,,,"English","Coasts Ports",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907087054

While RBD concepts are relatively new to geological engineering, they require little additional effort beyond conventional analyses and provide a more complete definition of risk and safety.

As a result of mining the depressions in the surface are being formed there and then flooded with water. These changes negatively influence the development of the Karviná District and together with other geofactors cause problems in foundation engineering.

The displacement of crown is most and reaches to 7 cm which is less than ultimate displacement in teams of Code of Design on Tunnel of Railway. Extracted deformation ahead of working face is significantly affected when the distance is less than 8 m. Transversal plastic zone is mainly located at crown, shoulder and invert. The depth of it is 4 m. Pore water pressure and energy distribution ahead of working face increases firstly, and then it reduces. The peak value is located at 10 m ahead of working face. Not only does the analysis method fit for Qilianshan tunnel, but it can be a reference for similar geological engineering. © 2012 IEEE.","anisotropy; energy; mechanical-hydraulic coupling; porwater pressure; tunnel","Analysis method; Coupling models; Deep-buried tunnel; During construction; Effective stress; energy; Energy density; Energy distributions; Gansu province; Geo-stress; Maximum shear stress; NorthWest China; Passenger dedicated line; Peak values; Plastic zones; Pore-water pressures; Research results; Side walls; Soft rocks; Surrounding rock; Working face; Anisotropy; Couplings; Information science; Pore pressure; Pressure distribution; Railroad tunnels; Shear stress; Tunnels","He, B.; School of Civil Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China; email: benguohe@126.com",,,,9780769547893,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

One way to offset the potential reduction in the number of future engineers in this country is to increase the number individuals from currently under-represented groups in STEM majors. For example, women make up more than one-half of all college students in this country but are less than one-fourth of the engineering student body. There are initiatives at all levels to increase the number of women studying engineering, and this paper describes two grass-roots level initiatives at the Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla, Missouri. The Missouri S&T geological engineering program and the Women's Leadership Institute teamed to develop two new programs intended to attract rising junior and senior high school women. Girls Go Green and Girls Go Global share many attributes including a focus on hands-on activities, contemplative activities, structured recreational activities, and interaction with undergraduate and graduate students who act as potential role models. Each camp includes theme-specific activities. For example, a multi-part Girls Go Green activity is the erection of a 1 kW wind turbine on a 50 ft guyed tower that requires the girls to learn basic surveying, the use of scratchpad math software (and trigonometry knowledge), and the ability to work together during the wind turbine assembly and erection. In Girls Go Global, female faculty from Brazil and Guatemala led country-specific activities such as a Guatemalan fashion show and a sing-along in Portuguese. Both programs are relatively new, but preliminary data are available that show meaningful direct and indirect yields associated with these efforts. © ASCE 2012.",,"College students; Demographic data; Engineering program; Female faculty; Graduate students; Guatemala; Guyed towers; Hands-on activities; High school; Math software; Missouris; Potential reduction; Preliminary data; Recreational activities; Role model; Science and Technology; Scratchpad; Turbine assembly; Under-represented groups; Personnel; Professional aspects; Water resources; Wind turbines; Students","Elmore, A.C.; Department of Geological Engineering, 129 McNutt Hall, Missouri University of Science and Technology, 1400 N.

One of the new components of water conveyance system in the north of Iran is the Karaj to Tehran water conveyance tunnel that has been excavated by a double shield TBM. This research has been performed on the second part of the tunnel with 14km long passes mainly through the pyroclastic and igneous rocks of Eocene age. The geological studies include field and laboratory investigations. Based on the results and for more exact investigation, tunnel alignment has been divided into 20 geological engineering units. Rock mass classifications have been performed for all units. Then, rock mass properties were calculated using empirical equations. Because of high overburden (up to 800m) and the presence of faults and crushed zones, it was necessary to evaluate squeezing potential along the critical section of the tunnel. Therefore, empirical and semi empirical approaches and a new method as critical strain have been used for evaluation of squeezing potential. Some experimental equations were used for estimation of critical strain and also Phase 2 program has been used to calculate tunnel convergence. Consequently, squeezing index was estimated. This index is used for determination of squeezing degree. As a result, fair squeezing potential was found in crushed zones along the tunnel route. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Critical strain; Engineering geology; Rock mass classification; Squeezing","Critical sections; Critical strains; Empirical equations; Engineering unit; Experimental equation; Laboratory investigations; New components; Rock mass classification; Rock mass properties; Semi-empirical approach; Squeezing; Tunnel alignments; Water conveyance; Earth boring machines; Engineering geology; Tectonics; Water supply; Tunnels; engineering geology; igneous rock; rock mass classification; TBM; tunneling; water supply; Alborz; Iran; Karaj; Tehran [Iran]","Khanlari, G.; Department of Geology, Bu-Ali Sina University, Hamedan, Iran; email: Khanlari_Reza@Yahoo.com",,,00137952,,EGGOA,,"English","Eng.

In particular, the conditions were characterized by a high percentage of very weak laminated shale and weathered rock mass, an unfavorable and very steep slope of the rock layers and unstable hydrological conditions with outflows of water in loosened tectonic zones. That structure and properties of the rock mass highly uncertain. This paper describes the influence of geological engineering and geotechnical conditions on the primary lining of a main road tunnel. The deformation of the primary lining was analyzed in terms of the percentage share of sandstones and shale, geomechanical classifications RMR (Bieniawski 1989) and QTS (Tesar 1979), types of the primary lining and the use of rock bolts and micropiles. The analysis was preceded by characterization of geological engineering conditions and technological characterization of applied primary linings. Displacements of the primary lining, greater than acceptable, occurred several times in a top heading during tunneling. The primary lining was reinforced by additional rock bolts and wire mesh, a thicker layer of shotcrete and micropiles if deformation reached the emergency state for some types of linings and they didn't indicate any tendency for stabilization. The reinforcement was used until the deformation stabilization was achieved. In the most difficult conditions, the lining was reinforced by a longer micropile umbrella. Parameters for the primary lining were selected on the basis of ongoing geological engineering and geotechnical measurements, in accordance with NATM's principles. The rock mass around the tunnel in Laliki is an example of weak carrying capacity. The observed displacements in the rock mass indicate that the disturbed zone around the tunnel was heavily developed. The primary lining used in such conditions must bear a relatively high load capacity from overlying loosened material and therefore the lack of interaction with the surrounding rock mass should be assumed. The data obtained indicate that the use of the primary lining in the highly variable conditions in the Carpathian flysch requires accurate geological engineering and geotechnical analysis during the day-to-day process of tunneling in order to verify the projected assumptions. The primary linings should be reinforced as needed based on the results of geotechnical measurements, monitoring the interaction between the rock mass and the system of lining.","Flysch formation; Geological engineering conditions; Geotechnical measurements; Primary lining; Rock mass and primary lining interaction; Tunnel in Laliki",,"Majcherczyk, T.; Pracownia Geodynamiki i Inzynierii Środowiska, Instytut Gospodarki Surowcami Mineralnymi i Energia PAN, Kraków, Poland; email: pilecki@min-pan.krakow.pl",,,08600953,,,,"English; Polish","Gospodarka Surowcami Mineral.

However, the size effect and spatial effect have not been comprehensively considered. To investigate the spatial effect of RQD, three-dimensional(3D) fracture network modelling is used to simulate the actual rock mass, and numerous scan-lines are set to obtain RQD values. The result shows that the RQD values vary in different regions and have obvious spatial effect. To obtain the characteristics of RQD that could represent the whole rock mass quality, the analysis based on plenty of RQD samples should be conducted. In addition, to better reflect the inhomogeneity feature of rock mass, RQD ranges of different thresholds are studied; and the optimal threshold of 4 m that can comprehensively reflect the inhomogeneity feature of the investigated rock mass is determined. The size effect is an important feature of RQD. To investigate the feature, the RQD variation is researched by changing the scan-line length. The models and equations(i.e. A-A model, T-T model, A-A-S model, Priest-Hudson equation, and Senz-Kazi equation) are proposed and summarized. The size effects of different models are studied. The results show that: the error of size effect can be decreased using A-A-S model; when the threshold is relative large, the results by Priest-Hudson equation and Senz-Kazi equation have errors; and the RQD value based on 3D fracture network is more correct.","Rock mass; Rock mechanics; Rock quality designation(RQD); Size effect; Spatial effect","Fracture network; Geotechnical; Inhomogeneities; Optimal threshold; Rock mass; Rock mass qualities; Rock quality designation; Size effects; Spatial effect; Three dimensional fracture network; Value-based; Fracture; Quality control; Rock mechanics; Rocks; Size determination; Three dimensional","Zhang, W.; College of Construction Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin 130026, China; email: zhangwenlch@126.com",,,10006915,,YLGXF,,"Chinese","Yanshilixue Yu Gongcheng Xuebao",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866396423

Loess mountain areas are highly vulnerable to landslides; hence, the monitoring and generation of warnings regarding a loess landslide is an important element in the risk management of side slopes in these areas. A typical line engineering area of a loess plateau in west China was used as a case study. With field investigation and data analysis, the risk indicators of the loess landslide were studied. Fuzzy synthetic evaluation of risk was conducted on the basis of geological engineering. The distribution of landslides and the geographical regional division method for determining landslide risk were also studied. On the basis of risk geographic region division, the authors completed a geology-meteorology coupling analytical model aimed at inducing the rainfall agent. The results of this model can be used in risk warning for landslides in loess slide slopes. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Loess; Risk management; Slopes","Field investigation; Fuzzy synthetic evaluation; Geographic regions; Line engineering; Loess; Loess Plateau; Risk indicators; Side slope; Slopes; Soil mass; West China; Risk management; Risks; Landslides","Bai, M.; Beijing Jiaotong Univ., Dept. of Civil Engineering, Beijing, 100044, China; email: mngzhb@gmail.com",,,08873828,,JPCFE,,"English","J.

In our previous work, we proposed a novel electromagnetic induction-based deep displacement sensor (I-type) to predict deep horizontal displacement and a theoretical model called equation-based equivalent loop approach (EELA) to describe its sensing characters. However in many landslide and related geological engineering cases, both horizontal displacement and vertical displacement vary apparently and dynamically so both may require monitoring. In this study, a II-type deep displacement sensor is designed by revising our I-type sensor to simultaneously monitor the deep horizontal displacement and vertical displacement variations at different depths within a sliding mass. Meanwhile, a new theoretical modeling called the numerical integration-based equivalent loop approach (NIELA) has been proposed to quantitatively depict II-type sensors' mutual inductance properties with respect to predicted horizontal displacements and vertical displacements. After detailed examinations and comparative studies between measured mutual inductance voltage, NIELA-based mutual inductance and EELA-based mutual inductance, NIELA has verified to be an effective and quite accurate analytic model for characterization of II-type sensors. The NIELA model is widely applicable for II-type sensors' monitoring on all kinds of landslides and other related geohazards with satisfactory estimation accuracy and calculation efficiency. © 2012 by the authors.","Deep horizontal displacement; Deep vertical displacement; Electromagnetic induction-based deep displacement sensor; Mutual inductance; Theoretical modeling","article; electricity; electromagnetic field; geology; instrumentation; landslide; mathematical computing; photography; reproducibility; theoretical model; Electricity; Electromagnetic Phenomena; Geology; Landslides; Models, Theoretical; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Photography; Reproducibility of Results","Li, Q.; College of Mechatronics Engineering, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310018, China; email: lq_cjlu@163.com",,,14248220,,,22368467,"English","Sensors",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863022752

A novel means of predicting the geology based upon sparse observations of structural geology at the surface and from drill holes has been developed and used in several major tunnel studies in Europe. An example of this is the Lyons-Turin twin rail tunnel which is still in a development phase. This tunnel has been in planning and development for over 15 years already. An important aspect of this work is to characterise geological uncertainty along various possible tunnel paths as an input into early design optimisations for time, cost and risk avoidance strategies. Once the tunnel works commence and more detailed geological data is collected by daily mapping, progressive refinement of the geological model is desirable; geological conditions still to be encountered can be more accurately predicted. Faults and their offsets, dykes, geological unconformities, folding, as well as standard sedimentary processes are all correctly modelled in the software. It is important to allow for seamless interchange of geological models at various scales with CAD workflows so that sufficient detail can be readily accessed at the required scale. Also, the proposed tunnel in its correct geometry can become a 'section' in its own right. Progressive detailed local geology models in the vicinity of the advancing head are created from the regional scale work by cutting and pasting a starting model, then adding all the extra detail for the required engineering geology work. For all rocks, most standard geotechnical quantities such as sonic velocities, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are handled. These and any other phenomena from borehole observations can have variograms calculated and stratigraphically constrained estimations made in a least biased geostatistical manner, in advance of the tunnel. RQD, or a prediction of rock fractures, is handled by the faulting and folding modelling facilities. This is probably the more interesting issue to pursue, as the fractal nature from small scale fractures and joints, to large-scale faults, can now be characterised more convincingly.",,"Constrained estimation; Critical component; Development phase; Drill hole; Geological conditions; Geological data; Geological models; Geological setting; Geological uncertainty; Geology model; Geostatistical; Geotechnical; Geotechnical properties; Optimisations; Planning and development; Poisson's ratio; Progressive refinement; Rail tunnels; Regional scale; Risk avoidance; Rock fractures; Sedimentary process; Small scale; Sonic velocity; Tunnel design; Tunnel paths; Variograms; Work-flows; Young's Modulus; Faulting; Fracture; Geologic models; Railroad tunnels; Structural geology; Three dimensional; Tunnels","FitzGerald, D.; Intrepid Geophysics, 2/1 Male Street, Brighton VIC 3196, Australia; email: des@intrepid-geophysics.com",,,,9781921522376,,,"English","Australas.

One of the most commonly employed detection technologies is to take videos of borehole using a forward moving camera. Following this approach, the problem of stratum structure detection is transformed into the problem of constructing a panoramic image from the taken video sequences, which are typically in low quality. In this paper, we propose a novel method to create a panoramic image of the borehole from the video sequence without camera calibration and tracking. To stitch together pixels of neighboring frame images, our camera model is designed with a focal length changing feature, along with a small rotation freedom in the two-dimensional image space. Essentially, our camera model assumes target objects lie on a cylindrical wall and the camera moves forward along the central axis of the cylindrical wall. Our method robustly resolves these two degrees-of-freedoms through KLT feature tracking and constructs a panoramic image by stitching strips. Experiment results show that our method could efficiently generate high-quality panoramas for very long video sequences. © 2011 IEEE.","forward moving camera; panorama; stratum structure","Camera calibration; Camera model; Central axis; Cylindrical walls; Detection technology; Feature-tracking; Focal lengths; Fundamental problem; High quality; Low qualities; Moving cameras; panorama; Panoramic images; Project planning; Stratum structure; Target object; Two-dimensional images; Video sequences; Cameras; Computer aided design; Computer graphics; Principal component analysis; Video recording; Structural design","Yang, C.; School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, China; email: chl_yang@sdu.edu.cn",,,,9780769544977,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

The model studies area was 14.8 km2. Schematization of the groundwater conditions were based on data from 223 hydrogeological and Geological- engineering boreholes. Within the Pleistocene-Holocene aquifer there are numerous thin layers of silts, organic silts and clays, and therefore it was divided into the model to six layers, three permeable and three semipermeable. The calculation results show that the tunnel only slightly influence on groundwater flow. In groundwater balance no changes are noticeable after simulating the tunnel. In aquifers, through which the tunnel is simulated, slight bend of watertable level is observd (changing water table level from 0.5 to 3.0 cm).

Due to the local variance and spatial structure among attributes of boreholes, the geological properties at unknown location have to be estimated or interpolated by some special methods. However, classic statistical methods could not resolve such problem which includes selection of sample points, spatial estimation and comparison of bilateral data. A distance-weighted interpolation method for scattered borehole data points is proposed, which exploits the Kriging method in global geostatistics.

It is an important boundary for analysis of rock mass stability. Weak rock zone has been formed in a long geological period, and in this period, various rocks have undergone long-term consolidation of geostatic stress and tectonic stress; therefore, under in-situ conditions, their density and modulus of deformation are relatively high. Due to its fragmentary nature, once being exposed to the earth's surface, the structure of weak rock zone will soon be loosened, its density will be reduced, and its modulus of deformation will also be reduced significantly. Generally, weak rock zone can be found in large construction projects, especially in the dam foundation rocks of hydropower stations. These rocks cannot be eliminated completely by excavation. Furthermore, all tests nowadays are carried out after the exposure of weak rock zone, modulus of deformation under in-situ conditions cannot be revealed. In this paper, a test method explored by the authors has been introduced. This method is a whole multilayered medium deformation method. It is unnecessary to eliminate the relatively complete rocks covering on weak rock zone. A theoretical formula to obtain the modulus of deformation in various mediums has also been introduced. On-site comparative trials and indoor deformation modulus tests under equivalent density conditions have been carried out. We adopted several methods for the prediction researches of the deformation modulus of weak rock zone under in-situ conditions, and revealed a fact that under in-situ conditions, the deformation modulus of weak rock zone are several times higher than the test results obtained after the exposure. In a perspective of geological engineering, the research findings have fundamentally changed peoples' concepts on the deformation modulus of weak rock zone, provided important theories and methods for precise definition of deformation modulus of deep weak rock zone under cap rock conditions, as well as for reasonable engineering applications. © 2011 Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Confining pressure; Deformation modulus; In-situ conditions: Stress; Multilayered; Weak rock zone",,"Zhang, Y.; School of Hydraulic and Hydroelectric Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China; email: zhangenhua11@163.com",,,16726316,,,,"English","J.

The phenomenon of zonal disintegration appears and is monitored in surrounding rock mass of deep tunnels. The special geological engineering phenomenon has attracted scholars' great attention in the field rock mechanics. However, the knowledge on the fracture shape and forming mechanism of the zonal disintegration is not quite enough. There is doubt about whether or not the connection on the in-situ TV observation can represent the whole tunnel impersonally. There is argument that the fractured zones are the concentric circle of the cavity or the spirals and slip lines. The issue determines the essence of the zonal disintegration and whether or not it is an unexplained new phenomenon by using the theory in existence. In order to know about the phenomenon in substance, geo-mechanical model tests are carried out on the deep mine tunnel of Dingji Coal Mine in Huainan Mine area. Comparing the results of in-situ monitoring with those of model tests, the main characteristics and changing laws of the zonal disintegration are summarized. The zonal disintegration is the circular pull fracture which is concentric to the cavity.

Therefore, the geological engineering disasters caused by changes in the thickness of water films of special clay can be effectively inhibited. © 2010 China University of Geosciences and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","expansive clay; ionic soil stabilizer; red clay; sliding clay","clay; expansive soil; shear strength; shear test; soil reinforcement; soil stabilization","Xiang, W.; Three Gorges Research Center for Geo-hazard, Ministry of Education, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China; email: xiangwei@cug.edu.cn",,,1674487X,,,,"English","J.

It also argues that the classification of capacity estimates should follow concepts in the existing SPE Petroleum Resource Management System as closely as possible. The Energy &amp; Environmental Research Centre (EERC) (Gorecki et al., 2009) have developed a definition of ""practical storage capacity"" that parallels the definition of petroleum reserves as ""the quantity of hydrocarbons which are anticipated to be commercially recovered from known accumulation at a given date forward"", but the EERC acknowledge that there is currently a problem with implementing a price of carbon. This paper develops the economic analysis further than the EERC. Like the EERC, we demonstrate that analytical and numerical injectivity modelling based on geological models of the subsurface can help determine practical storage capacity. In doing this, the paper makes observations about methods for estimating storage capacity, shows results of reservoir simulations and economic analyses, draws on SPE and internationally accepted methodologies and definitions of petroleum resources and discusses how equivalent definitions can be applied to storage capacity. Finally, the paper provides recommendations for an improved CO2 storage capacity classification system.

The Plan outlines a cooperative program of earthquake monitoring, research, implementat ion, education, and outreach activities performed by the NEHRP agencies. Theseagencies are: • the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency; • the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the NEHRP lead agency; • the National Science Foundation; and, • the U.S. Geological Survey. The continued success of NEHRP will emphasize the linked roles of the NEHRP agencies and their partners, based on a common vision and sharedmission. The NEHRP Vision is: A nation that is earth quakeresilient in public safety, economic strength, and national security. The continued success of NEHRP will emphasize the linked roles of the NEHRP agencies and their partners, based on a common vision and sharedmission. The NEHRP Vision is: A nation that is earth quakeresilient in public safety, economic strength, and national security. The NEHRP Mission is: To develop, disseminate, and promote knowledge, tools, and practices for earthquake risk reduction-through coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency partnerships among the NEHRP agencies and their stakeholders-that improve the Nation’s earthquake resilience in public safety, economic strength, and national security. Accomplishing the NEHRP mission requires developing and applying knowledge based on research in the geological, engineering, and social sciences; educating leaders and the public; and assisting State, local, and private-sector leaders to develop standards, policies, and practices. The NEHRP agencies have established three overarching, long-term Strategic Goals, with 14 associated objectives, to support this mission: Goal A: Improve understanding of earthquake processes and impacts. Objective 1: Advance understanding of earthquake phenomena and generation processes. Objective 2: Advance understanding of earthquake effects on the built environment. Objective 3: Advance understanding of the social, behavioral, and economic factors linked to implementing risk reduction and mitigation strategies in the public and private sectors. Objective 4: Improve post-earthquake information acquisition and management. Goal B: Develop cost-effective measures to reduce earthquake impacts on individuals, the built environment, and society-at-large. Objective 5: Assess earthquake hazards for research and practical application. Objective 6: Develop advanced lossestimation and risk assessment tools. Objective 7: Develop tools that improve the seismic performance of buildings and other structures. Objective 8: Developtools thatimprovetheseismicperformanceofcriticalinfrastructure. Goal C: Improve the earthquake resilience of communities nationwide. Objective 9: Improve the accuracy, timeliness, and content of earthquake information products. Objective 10: Develop comprehensiveearthquake risk scenarios and risk assessments. Objective 11: Support development of seismic standards and building codes and advocate their adoption and enforcement. Objective 12: Promote the implementation of earthquake-resilient measures in professional practice and in private and public policies. Objective 13: Increase public awareness of earthquake hazardsand risks. Objective 14: Develop the Nation’s human resource base in earthquake safety fields. The three goals honor congressional intent and result from the work of the NEHRP agencies in concert with the stakeholder community. For each goal, Chapter 3 outlines key objectives, implementation strategies, and anticipated outcomes that provide insight into the importance of each activity to the Nation. Several guiding principles, described in Chapter 2, served as the basis for developing the goals and objectives. The Plan adds nine new cross-cutting Strategic Priorities that directly support the goals and augment other ongoing agency activities needed to satisfy them. The NEHRP agencies plan to emphasize these priorities during the Strategic Plan period. The priorities are: • Fully implement the Advanced National Seismic System. • Improve techniques forevaluating and rehabilitating existing buildings. • Further develop PerformanceBased Seismic Design. • Increase consideration of socioeconomic issues related to hazard mitigation implementation. • Develop a national post-earthquake information management system. • Develop advanced earthquake risk mitigation technologies and practices. • Develop guidelines forearthquake-resilient lifeline components and systems. • Develop and conduct earthquake scenarios for effective earthquake risk reduction and response and recovery planning. • Facilitate improved earthquake mitigation at Stateand local levels. The Strategic Priorities were developed through a number of key activities in 2006 that highlighted gaps in the Program activities that were outlined in the previous Plan. Following these activities, the ICC identified the Strategic Priorities that deserve increased emphasis by the NEHRP agencies. Progress on these priorities will depend on available resources. The Strategic Priorities are described in Chapter 4. These goals, objectives, and Strategic Priorities are consistent with and expand upon the ""Grand Challenges for Disaster Reduction: Priority Interagency Earthquake Implementation Actions"" identified by the Subcommittee on Disaster Reduction of the President's National Science and Technology Council. This Plan provides a straightforward and executable strategy for NEHRP. Successful strategic planning and Program accomplishment must be consistent with existing policies, based on realistic assumptions, and responsive to changing conditions. The pace of Program accomplishment will depend on the resources that are available to the Program agencies during the 2009-2013 Plan period. This Plan is intended to guide relevant funding decisions by NEHRP agencies. Following the adoption of this Plan, the NEHRP agencies will jointly develop a Management Plan that details Strategic Plan implementation activities that are consistent with agency appropriations and funding priorities. The NEHRP agencies will keep abreast of advancements in science and technology, and adjust short- and long-term developmental efforts accordingly. NEHRP will remain focused on the elements of this Strategic Plan, but will adapt to contingencies and opportunities that may arise. If a major earthquake occurs in the United States during the Plan period, NEHRP will initiate efforts to study the effects and impacts of that event, including successes, failures, and unforeseen problems that arose in mitigation, response, and recovery practices and policies, and adjust this Plan as needed. The costs of earthquake loss reduction and post-earthquake recovery are shared by the public and private sectors. The role of NEHRP is to provide the public and private sectors with the scientific and engineering information, knowledge, and technologies needed to prepare for earthquakes and thus reduce the costs of losses and recovery. NEHRP will continue to develop partnerships with its stakeholder community of earthquake professionals working in academia and in business, government, technical, professional, and codes-andstandards organizations that are involved with the earthquake risk reduction process, in fulfillment of its role. A 2003 report1 noted that ""our ability to secure society against catastrophic earthquake losses depends on a strong and viable NEHRP.""

The 3D geometry of complex cave systems have been analysed in relation to their geological context as well as their hydrogeological boundary conditions. The methodology allowed for the first time statistical evidence of the inception horizon concept. Thereby it confirms that the development of karst conduits under phreatic conditions is strongly related to a restricted number of so called inception horizons. An inception horizon is a part of a rock succession that is particularly susceptible to the development of karst conduits because of physical, lithological or chemical deviation from the predominant carbonate facies within the limestone sequence. It passively or actively favours the localisation of dissolutional voids. The methodology based on detailed geological 3D models and cave survey allowed us to demonstrate the existence of inception horizons in karst conduit genesis. This fact improves significantly the prediction of karst conduits, knowledge that is of relevance for geological engineering problems (e.g. tunnelling, oil industry, hydrogeology) as well as for the scientific understanding of the evolution of karst systems. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The location of the landslide was in a geological structure of weakly bounded conglomerates lying above a flysch, in an area where numerous slides have been previously reported. In the paper the results of a geological engineering investigation of the Bol landslide are presented. The investigation results show that the landslide was triggered by a combination of improperly started earthworks, an increase in air temperature in days preceding landslide that caused snow melt, and abundant rainfall, but the primary cause of the landslide was weathering of the flysch. In other words, despite the fact that contact between the flysch and the conglomerates slopes is in approximate correspondence with the slope of the hillside, the landslide surface was not in contact between the conglomerates and marl, but deeper in the flysch, provoked by the penetration of the weathering front into the flysch. Numerical modelling results were able to reproduce this mechanism by incorporating strength degradation into the weathered zone, determined by field investigation. The results of the research can be used to predict potential slides not only in the area under study. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Marls; Rockslide mechanisms; Strength degradation; Weathering","Degradation; Erosion; Fertilizers; Landslides; Soil mechanics; Air temperatures; Field investigations; Geological engineering investigations; Geological structures; Marls; Numerical modelling; Rockslide mechanisms; Slope instabilities; Snow melts; Strength degradation; Weathering; air temperature; conglomerate; dip; flysch; geological structure; landslide; marl; numerical model; slope stability; Croatia; Eurasia; Europe; Southern Europe","Miščević, P.; Faculty of Civil Engineering and Architecture, University of Split, Matice hrvatske 15, Split 21000, Croatia; email: predrag.miscevic@gradst.hr",,,09430105,,ENGOE,,"English","Environ.

For this purpose, smooth and roughened steel laboratory small-scale micropiles surrounded by dense sand were inserted in predrilled holes of larger diameter made in highly expansive clay. The expansive clay was compacted in a steel box (50 cm × 50 cm × 35 cm) to a final height of 20 cm. Steel plates (25 cm × 25 cm × 1 cm) were used to model footings. The heads of the model micropiles were fastened to the steel plate. Footings with zero, one, two or four micropiles were prepared then the compacted clay in the laboratory box was flooded with water then upward movement of the model footings due to compacted clay swelling was monitored with time. The results showed that the percentage reduction in heave due to micropile reinforcement was larger for roughened micropiles and increased with increasing number and diameter of micropiles. The maximum measured percentage reduction in heave was 87.2 obtained when four 18 mm diameter roughened micropiles were used. A comparison between measured and predicted percentage reduction in heave using the proposed method of Nusier and Alawneh (Geotechnical and Geological Engineering Journal, 2004, 22, No. 1, 89-104) was made, and the results of the comparison showed acceptable agreement. © 2009 Thomas Telford Ltd.","Piles & piling","Geologic models; Geotechnical engineering; Piles; Plates (structural components); Reinforcement; Steel; Compacted clays; Dense sands; Engineering journals; Expansive clays; Expansive soils; Geotechnical; Light-weight structures; Micropiles; Pre-drilled holes; Steel boxes; Steel plates; Upward movements; Clay minerals; clay; compaction; comparative study; expansive soil; footing; heave; laboratory method; pile; reinforcement; sand; steel structure; swelling","Nusier, O.

When introductory thermodynamics is combined with fluid mechanics, this task becomes more difficult. At Michigan Technological University (Michigan Tech), Civil Engineering, Geological Engineering and Biomédical Engineering students take an introductory Thermodynamics/Fluid Mechanics course, ENG 3200. These students have varied backgrounds and interests which increases the challenges of teaching. The typical enrollment is 80 students per section. To address these challenges, the instructors, along with the graduate teaching assistants, developed an initial pilot study to test and assess the effectiveness of the use on active and non-traditional methods in an introductory thermo-fluids class. The first innovation was piloted in the fall 2008 semester and involves the exam structure. Prior to this semester, students took an exam in ENG 3200 and then had the opportunity to earn ""redemption"" points through re-doing the exam outside of class. This method received major student criticism. Therefore, a new tool was needed. In the fall 2008, students took their exams over two class periods. They began the exam during the first session. After class, they could review course notes and material, and discuss the exam problems with anyone except their instructor. During the second session, they made changes and completed the exam. The second innovative learning tool deals with how students learn the course material. Many example problems are solved in class with student input. These activities go well beyond the standard ""in-class"" example problems. Within this new format, it is the students who are asked questions regarding the solution process, but are not necessarily solving the entire problem. This method helps students to learn how to apply the thermo/fluids concepts prior to completing their homework. This technique results in more student engagement in the form of questions, input and comments. Additionally, outside of class, students are encouraged to answer basic conceptual questions or problems regarding the week's course material on an interactive course web page (Blackboard). While completing the assessment, students learn why a certain answer is correct and what some common misconceptions are. For each assessment completed, students may earn points that are added to their exam score. This paper will discuss these changes, along with providing preliminary assessment data and will recommend planned steps for a detailed study to follow. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2009.",,"Education; Fluid mechanics; Problem solving; Students; Teaching; Thermodynamics; Websites; Conceptual questions; Graduate teaching assistants; Innovative learning; Michigan Technological University; Preliminary assessment; Solution process; Student engagement; Student involvements; Engineering education","Marlor, K.; Civil and Environmental Engineering, Michigan Technological UniversityUnited States",,"American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,,"English","ASEE Annu.

Rational earthquake excitation and damping were discussed for geological engineering. Horizontal and vertical excitations were considered simultaneously in the analyses. A model capable of simulating the nonlinear static and dynamic elastic-plastic behavior of soil was used to model the soil, and a bilinear elastic-plastic model having hardening behavior was used to model the soil nailing. A friction element was employed to describe the soil structure interaction behavior. Our research focused on the seismic performance of the horizontal and vertical slope deformation, soil nailing axial force, and earth pressure subjected to horizontal and vertical excitations. The results show that the seismic performance of slope protected by soil nailing is good; soil nailing axial force increases after an earthquake; permanent slope displacement occurs during an earthquake; and the peak earth pressure distribution during an earthquake is similar to the earth pressure before the earthquake.

The basic concepts and fundamental functions of NUMO's RMS are further development of approaches followed in other programs, both in and outside of the radioactive waste management. However, NUMO's intension is to utilize RMS more actively to support the decision-making process, which is beyond other applications of RMS to date. Based on the analysis of NUMO 's work process, NUMO reached a conclusion that a work brake-down approach is more suitable for structuring the requirements and decisions. The top priority decision is ""to select a suitable site"" (from the volunteer sites) for the next stage of the site selection process. A decision should be made only after satisfring all requirements derived from safety, geological, engineering, legal, economical and social aspects. Each of the above requirements can be expressed in terms of sub-requirements that have to be satisfied. To ensure completeness in such development is not trivial, because RMS is called to manage a wide-range of information concerning the HL W geological disposal. This stored information will then be utilized to support the fundamental ""decision-making"" on implementation of the Japanese disposal program at each stage of site selection, licensing, construction, operation and closure. Currently a trial RMS is being tested, aimed at illustrating the application of the system andfinding areas where further improvements are required.",,"Basic concepts; Decision making process; Disposal programs; Further development; Geological disposals; High level radioactive wastes; Information concerning; Management systems; Other applications; Requirement management; Socio-economics; Special boundaries; Work process; Decision making; Industrial waste treatment; Instrument scales; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Site selection; Social aspects; Waste disposal; Radioactive waste disposal","Suzuki, S.; Nuclear Waste Management Organization, 1-23, Shiba 4-Chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-0014, Japan; email: ssuzuki@numo.or.jp",,,,9781605604862,,,"English","Am.

The analysis of the mechanical and physical characteristics of the soils showed that one of the soils did not meet the standard set for highways. Therefore the optimum soil composite and cementation methods have been employed. The suitability of the method of improving soils has been varified by means of such parameters as, compression strength samples containing from 4-10% of cement and the frost resistance index. The research revealed that samples containing from 4-8 % of cement do not comply with the norms for highways. Despite the correct compression strength criterion for mixtures that contain 10% of cement, low value of frost resistance index limits the possibilities of using this cement-soil mixture in the upper layers of the ground.

However, several typical topology optimization algorithms are finite element (FE) based, where mesh-dependent zigzag representation of boundaries is barely avoidable in both intermediate and final results. To tackle the problem, this paper proposes a new fixed-grid-based bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization method, namely FG BESO. The adoption of an FG FE framework enables a continuous boundary change in the course of topology optimization, which provides a means of dealing with not only the non-smooth boundary of the final design but also the interpretation of intermediate densities. As a class of important practical application, it is interesting to make use of the new FG BESO method to the reinforcement design for underground tunnels. To accommodate the FG BESO technique to geological engineering applications, a nodal sensitivity is derived for a two-phase material model comprising the artificial reinforcement and original rock. In this paper, some innovative topological designs of tunnel reinforcements are presented for minimizing the floor and sidewall heaves under different geological loading conditions.

Like radar systems used in geological engineering, these devices acquire data via electromagnetic waves. The basic idea was to use such data to identify sugar beets in agricultural soils, which would provide non-invasive in-soil detection of sugar beets in order to enable counting of individual sugar beets and determination of single sugar beet root mass. Further goals were to enhance the methods and procedures of the UWB radar technology for other applications in agriculture, as a general goal, and to define applicability restrictions of the system for sugar beet and other root crops. In the first phase of the research, laboratory experiments were used to develop, test, and consequently improve the data acquisition and processing procedures. In this first phase, the feasibility of detecting sugar beets in soil in laboratory conditions using the reflected energy with a simple threshold approach was confirmed. In the second phase, the potential detectability and size estimation of sugar beets based on the distribution and consistency of backscattered energy amounts obtained in field conditions was researched. Based on the data recorded in field conditions, visual detectability was above 90%, with good correlations between sugar beet positions and energy peak positions.

Background: The relative effectiveness of 2-D and 3-D displays is task dependent, leading to the need for multiple frames of reference as users switch tasks. The use of smooth rotation to provide visual momentum has received little scrutiny in the task-switching context. A cognitive model of the processes involved in switching viewpoints on a set of spatial elements is proposed. Methods: In three experiments, participants judged the properties of two points placed on terrain depicted as 2-D or 3-D displays. Participants indicated whether Point A was higher than Point B, or whether Point B could be seen from Point A. Participants performed the two tasks in pairs of trials, switching tasks and displays within the pair. In the continuous transition condition the display dynamically rotated in depth from one display format to the other. In the discrete condition there was an instantaneous viewpoint shift that varied across experiments (Experiment 1: immediate; Experiment 2: delay; Experiment 3: preview). Results: Performance after continuous transition was superior to that after discrete transition. Conclusion: The visual momentum provided by smooth rotation helped users switch tasks. Application: The use of dynamic transition is recommended when observers examine multiple views of terrain over time. The model may serve as a useful heuristic for designers. The results are pertinent to command and control, geological engineering, urban planning, and imagery analysis domains.

Additionally, other engineering undergraduate and graduate students have elected to take the course. This diverse group has presented challenges in presenting the material such that the students see how thermodynamics and fluid mechanics relate to their fields. As material is introduced, students learn conceptually about different applications or data. Additionally, materials and examples have been developed and/or modified to illustrate how the course concepts can be applied and used in real world applications. This paper will describe examples and problems that students learn to solve in class that are different from traditional thermo-fluids problems. Student reactions and comments regarding these problems will be presented. As part of the course assessment, students complete a pre- and post-test containing many thermo-fluids definitions.

Similar to radars used in geological engineering, these devices acquire data via electromagnetic waves. The basic idea was to use such data to identify sugar beets in agricultural soils. The initial research task was to distinguish sugar beets from the surrounding soil. Within the first phase of the project, laboratory experiments have been used to test and improve data acquisition and processing procedures. In this phase the feasibility of detecting sugar beets in soil in laboratory conditions with a simple threshold approach on the reflected energy was confirmed. In the second phase the detectability and size estimation potential of sugar beets based on distribution and consistency of backscattered energy amounts obtained in field conditions has been researched. This paper is the final report on project and it contains the evaluation of the potential of UWB radar system for yield mapping of sugar beet made on the basis of field measurements. The sugar beet detectability and mass determination potentials in field conditions have been evaluated. The simple threshold detection approach on the reflected energy showed insufficient flexibility on the data recorded in field conditions. Visual detectability on the same data for all scanned sugar beet rows was from 90% to 96% with good correlations between sugar beet positions and energy peak positions. The best correlations between mass of sugar beets and the amounts of backscattered energy were over 80%.","GPR; Sugar beet; UWB radar; Yield mapping","Backscattering; Data acquisition; Electromagnetic waves; Ground penetrating radar systems; Soils; Backscattered energy; Sugar beet; UWB radar; Yield mapping; Sugars","Konstantinovic, M.; Institute for Agricultural Engineering, University of Bonn, Nussallee 5, 53115 Bonn, Germany; email: konstant@uni-bonn.de",,,,,,,"English","ASABE Ann.

Massara 13, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy; Prestininzi, A., Department of Earth Sciences, University of Rome La Sapienza, Italy","Numerous Deep-Seated Gravitational Slope Deformations (DSGSDs) occur throughout Italy, that originate from particular tectono-stratigraphic settings, relief, seismicity, deglaciation, as well as from intense and deep processes of chemico-physical weathering of crystalline-metamorphic rocks. These DSGSDs are particularly widespread in the Calabrian mountains. This study is focused on the Mt. Granieri-Salincriti slope, on the Ionian side of the Serre Massif, where granites and granodiorites (Stilo Unit, Palaeozoic) are in contact with metamorphites through a thermal-metamorphic aureole. This setting generates deep geochemical processes, inducing intense chemical weathering. These processes are mainly due to the interaction between groundwater and the sulphides that are contained in the local pegmatitic-hydrothermal intrusions, especially along the thermal-metamorphic contact belt. The Mt. Granieri-Salincriti slope has an important DSGSD, which is associated with many active and/or quiescent landslides. Among these landslides, the Salincriti rock avalanche-debris flow (about 2 M m3) represents the paroxysmal and terminal stage of the deep creep deformations of Mt. Granieri, typifying a geological setting that is common in the Calabrian Arc. This multi-disciplinary study assessed the weathering susceptibility of the local crystalline-metamorphic rocks, especially those lying along thermal-metamorphic contact belts, by characterising the weathering horizons and the spatial distribution of weathering in the rock mass. The study was also aimed at identifying the relations between weathering, above all deep geochemical processes, effects on rocks and slope morphodynamics. The methodology was based on detailed geological data, geological-engineering surveys, geomorphology and surface hydrogeology analyses, as well as physico-mechanical laboratory tests. These investigations, supported by a monitoring program, led to the development of an engineering-geological model of the slope. Geological character (attributed to a thermal-metamorphic contact belt), geomorphological evidence and geomechanical elements elucidated the interactions between deep geochemical processes and weak belts in the investigated rocks, as well as the critical role that these interactions play in the evolution of deep-seated creep deformations and associated shallow landslides. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This technology is currently used by the petroleum industry in several countries (United States, Canada, North Sea, and Indonesia) to dispose of nonhazardous oil-field waste solids. Granular or ground solids of grain size less than 5 mm (0.19 in.) are mixed with waste liquids to form a slurry that is pumped down a deep well under conditions of continuous hydraulic fracturing pressure (pinj &gt; σv). This article discusses rock mechanics aspects and geological engineering criteria for deep slurry injection. Specifically, the geometrical, lithostratigraphical, and physical parameters that characterize a stratum as a suitable target reservoir for slurried waste placement are addressed. The most important criteria are permeability, porosity, reservoir thickness, depth, and structural geology (of the region). A geological assessment model was developed to serve as a screening process to select suitable reservoirs for slurried waste placement. The screening process to select suitable reservoirs is composed of two steps: a decision tree and a semiquantitative ranking system that provides a numerical score for the stratum. The apparently robust assessment model was tested on several sites representing diverse sedimentary geology in the United States, Canada, the North Sea, and Indonesia. Copyright © 2007.

The reservoirs are of too low permeability to be placed onto production without massive hydraulic fracture treatments. The article describes the geological engineering framework, mineralogy investigation, hydrolytic weakening experiments, as well as application and results of new kinds of fracturing fluids. Rock mineralogy investigations indicated that rocks in the reservoir have a strong water sensitive property and a strong component of plastic behavior. Some tuffaceous rocks are rich in alkali minerals and become soft when exposed to aqueous fracture fluids. Although the fracture opening mechanism is the same as for normal sandstone, fracture extension is relatively suppressed and the fracture width is different from elastic predictions for normal sandstone. The analysis led to the changes in treatment stratages. The key difference from previous treatment is that clay content and concentration of different minerals were taken into consideration of fracture fluid design. Different kinds of emulsified fracturing fluid were designed used to mitigate swelling and hydrolytic weakening effects. By the end of 2005, 163 intervals in 66 wells have been treated using these new kinds of fracturing fluids, with a success rate of 97%.

Before this, the study of soils was dominated by geologists, agronomists and chemists. It was Dokuchaev in 1886, who recognized soil as a physical entity with properties acquired from the impact of soil-forming factors, among which the geological substrate was only one. This vision resulted in the establishment of a new discipline, called pedology. With time, geologists began to appreciate soil in a pedological context. In fact, palaeosols in particular have been utilized to interpret the stratigraphy of metamorphic and sedimentary rocks and Quaternary deposits. Also, palaeosols have been used for correlating unconsolidated sediments, faults and neotectonics, or for the relative dating of deposits or surfaces. Weathering is a field where soil chemists have interacted with geochemists to evaluate chemical denudation and landscape evolution. Geological engineering in terms of water storage, pollutant transport, and critical load, in addition to location, design and construction of roads, is another area of interaction between soil researchers and geologists. The exploration of the planets of the solar system is a field which has assembled soil chemists and geochemists to collect, analyse and interpret data sent by space vehicles. Future interactions between geology and soil science will occur on issues such as: water in the vadose zone; risks due to Earth movements; and functions of soils in ecosystems. We predict and also welcome more communication between the two disciplines, as solutions to some of these problems are demanded by society. © The Geological Society of London 2006.",,"geology; paleosol; pedology; soil chemistry; soil science; unconsolidated medium","Ugolini, F.C.; University of Florence, Department of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition, Florence, Italy; email: fugolini@unifi.it","Frossard E.Blum W.E.H.Warkentin B.P.",,03058719,1862392072; 9781862392076,,,"English","Geol.

Technology has progressed to the point that microseismic monitoring of hydraulic fracture treatments can provide key information to characterize fracture development. At the onset of this stimulation project, in-depth knowledge of reservoir, completion, production, geophysical, and geological engineering were integrated to determine the solution. The integration of these domains of expertise led to project success. The results presented within are from a series of hydraulic fracture stimulations in the Bossier Sand formation where field-wide screen-out problems were historically observed. This paper documents the integrated process utilized to solve the screenout problem as well as to establish a way forward to achieve optimized completions in the target sand. Within the course of this project, microseismic monitoring coupled with sound fracture engineering technology led to several observations, a) The original design was not contained in the target sand, b) Microseismic monitoring and computer model simulation using calibrated stresses confirmed undesired fracture development uphole. c) Microseismic monitoring confirmed formation micro-imager log based fracture azimuth determination.

Due to geological body inherent characteristics of discontinuity, inhomogeneity, coupled fluid-solid and unknown initial state, key scientific issues in engineering geomechanics are how to judge current state of geological body, how to describe mechanical properties of geological body, and how to simulate the evolution from continuous to discontinuous failure process. Researches in the area of engineering geomechanics should take geology as the foundation, take mechanics as the analytical tool, and its aim should face engineering. The engineering problems to be solved include investigating the geometrical and mechanical properties of geological body, developing the analytical method for geological body stability, and providing the design basis for geological engineering as well as the prediction and forecast scheme. Whether model experiments or simulation results of experiment can answer engineering questions is determined by the extent to identification of geological conditions. But experimental studies can be recognized as a powerful tool to verify the results of numerical simulation; and geological investigation and spot survey are indispensable parts in engineering geomechanics. The mechanical classification of geological body embodies the underlying role of geology, and is able to quantitatively represent the geological environments. The construction of mechanical models, which meets engineering requirement, needs to consider rock masses with discontinuity, rock and soil aggregates as well as the interaction between flow in fractured rock and rock masses. The extraction of measurement parameters, development of approaches to obtain these parameters, and research on relevant test devices require the participation of geomechanics. While present mechanical models are improved or new models are developed, more attention should be paid to the verification and application of new methods.","Characteristics of geological body; Classification of rock mass; Engineering geology; Mechanical model; Monitoring; Numerical analysis","Computer simulation; Condition monitoring; Failure (mechanical); Mathematical models; Mechanical properties; Numerical analysis; Rock mechanics; Rocks; Soil mechanics; Stability; Engineering geomechanics; Geological body; Mechanical classification; Mechanical model; Rock mass; Engineering geology","Li, S.; Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080, China; email: shli@imech.ac.cn",,,10006915,,YLGXF,,"Chinese","Yanshilixue Yu Gongcheng Xuebao",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746806301

Moro 5, 00185 Roma, Italy","The landscape of Tuscia, i.e. the area extending between Latium, Toscana and Umbria, features wide volcanic plateaux overlying clayey-sandy-conglomeratic sedimentary deposits. The volcanic deposits identified in this area originate from different stages of eruption of three volcanic districts: Cimino (SABATINI, 1912; NICOLETTI, 1969; MICHELUCCINI et alii, 1971; SOLLEVANTI, 1983); Vico (LOCARDI, 1965; MATTIAS & VENTRIGLIA, 1970; BORGHETTI et alii, 1981; SOLLEVANTI, 1983; FORNASERI, 1985; BERTAGNINI & SBRANA, 1986; LAURENZI & VILLA, 1987; PERINI et alii, 1997; BARBERI et alii, 1994); and Sabatino (ALVAREZ, 1973; CORDA et alii, 1978; FORNASERI, 1985; CIONI et alii, 1993; DE RITA et alii, 1993; CAMPOBASSO et alii, 1994; KARNER & RENNE, 1998; KARNER et alii, 2001). The sedimentary deposits, of lower Pliocene to Quaternary age, were emplaced into the Chiani-Tiber river basin (BARBERI et alii, 1994; MANCINI et alii, 2001; GIROTTI & MANCINI, 2003). Numerous villages and towns of high historical-scenic value, such as Orte, Bassano in Teverina, Bomarzo, Chia, Faleria, Civita Castellana, Castel S. Elia and Calcata - which are the focus of this paper - are situated on the above plateaux. The morphological evolution of the investigated area makes it prone to slope instability processes (MANFREDINI et alii, 1980; LEMBO FAZIO & RIBACCHI, 1991). This paper describes the findings from a geological-engineering study of the above towns, supported by facies analysis of the deposits ascribable to eruptive units. Based on the above findings, the paper discusses the impact of the factors bearing on the morphological evolution, thus on the local slope instabilities. Particular emphasis was placed on the geomechanical characterisation of the jointed rock masses lying at the top of the local hills and on the construction of geological-engineering sections representing the observed instability conditions. The latter sections made it possible to also assess the influence of geological and geometrical factors affecting the tuff plateau/sedimentary bedrock interactions, such as thickness, size and isolation from nearby portions of the rock mass. The assumptions on the influence of the specific factors identified, adopted in the reference geological-engineering models, were validated by stress-strain analyses conducted via FEM and FDM. The analyses, which relied on a critical interpretation of the reference geological- engineering models, enabled assessment of the role that the various susceptibility factors play in instability processes. In summary, the results from the study infer that jointing conditions have a crucial impact on the evolution of the cliffs of Calcata, Castel S. Elia and Civita Castellana, whereas at Faleria, Orte, Bassano in Teverina, Bomarzo and Chia, the dominant controlling factor is the stress/strain interaction induced by deformability contrasts. It is worth emphasising that, in the latter case, a significant role is also played by the thickness/width ratio of the tuff plate, as well as by its isolation or connection to the nearby main plateau. The above-mentioned morphometric conditions are involved in two main styles of stress evolution: i) stress release, i.e. lateral stress relaxation of the tuffaceous plates, due to the cutting of the cliffs by streams and to their subsequent evolution as a result of gravity; or ii) stress relief, i.e. stress relaxation of the overall tuff plate, due to deformations which are roughly parallel to its planar extension and resulting from rigidity contrasts with respect to the underlying bedrock, having a marked elasto-plastic behaviour. In the morphological evolution of the investigated area, the above two stress responses may be ascribed, in time and space, to stages of a single evolutionary process. Through this process, the initially fairly regular margins of the tuff plates must have been gradually dismembered by channelised waters and by gravity, leaving relict reliefs of small size superimposed on the sedimentary bedrock.","Geological-engineering model; Geomorphological evolution; Instable towns; Northern Latium; Numerical modelling",,"Bozzano, F.; Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra, Università degli Studi di Roma La Sapienza, P.le A.

Unfortunately, in some particular cases, production wells are completed following commingled scheme. This is worsened further if only very few production tests are run for the field. This is the case for the Central Sumatera field with its 95 commingled production wells, among which only a few had undergone production tests and none of them have ever undergone production logging. Problems rise when the occassion came in which detailed production contribution from individual reservoir layer is required for the field's reservoir simulation modeling and production evaluation/prediction. This paper presents an approach to solve the problem. The approach is basically based on the application of soft computing (Fuzzy Logic) to investigate pattern of relationships between production contribution of layers in commingle wells and rock petrophysical data as well as other relevant geological/engineering data. For the purpose, thirteen wells (key wells) that have production tests are assigned, among which three wells are assigned for checking the validity of the recognised pattern. Using the validated most valid pattern, individual layer's production allocation for other wells are determined with well-log analysis data as the major input. Result estimates for the candidate wells are better compared to results produced by the conventional method of productivity index (PI) analogy. The resulted variation in water cut and separate oil and water split factors appear to be more realistic from any point of view.

Measurement of subsidence rate during reclamation is difficult to obtain as a two-dimensional subsidence map based on sparsely distributed field measurements is required. Owing to the severe temporal decorrelation induced by frequent soil loading and intense deformation gradients, the L-band was found to be effective for observing subsidence in reclaimed land. We evaluated the accuracy of the estimated subsidence rate using field measurements obtained by a magnetic probe extensometer from 42 ground stations. A two-dimensional subsidence map was generated from seven qualified pairs. The correlation coefficient R between the two-dimensional radar measurements and the in situ data was 0.87 with a rms error of 1.42cm. Two interferometric pairs obtained from an adjoining JERS-1 path were also used to verify the results. Independent estimations from the two different JERS-1 paths correlated each other with correlation coefficients R of 0.97 and 0.80. The main sources of the error were the reference DEM errors and additional phase noises calculated from phase fluctuation at stable points. The error from these two sources was ± 1.27 cm. The estimated maximum subsidence was about 60 cm over 352 days. The results demonstrate that L-band differential SAR interferometry is a useful tool in geological engineering applications. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",,"Coastal zones; Correlation theory; Image processing; Interferometry; Land reclamation; Spurious signal noise; Correlation coefficient; Phase fluctuation; Phase noise; Two-pass differential interferrometry; Synthetic aperture radar; coastal zone; deformation; reclaimed land; remote sensing; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar","Won, J.-S.; Department of Earth System Sciences, Yonsei University, 134 Shinchon-dong, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 120-479, South Korea; email: jswon@yonsei.ac.kr",,,01431161,,IJSED,,"English","Int.

Engineers can deal with uncertainty by ignoring it, by being conservative, by using the observational method, or by quantifying it. In recent years, reliability analysis and probabilistic methods have found wide application in geotechnical engineering and related fields. The tools are well known, including methods of reliability analysis and decision trees. Analytical models for deterministic geotechnical applications are also widely available, even if their underlying reliability is sometimes suspect. The major issues involve input and output. In order to develop appropriate input, the engineer must understand the nature of uncertainty and probability. Most geotechnical uncertainty reflects lack of knowledge, and probability based on the engineer's degree of belief comes closest to the profession's practical approach. Bayesian approaches are especially powerful because they provide probabilities on the state of nature rather than on the observations. The first point in developing a model from geotechnical data is that the distinction between the trend or systematic error and the spatial error is a modeling choice, not a property of nature. Second, properties estimated from small samples may be seriously in error, whether they are used probabilistically or deterministically. Third, experts generally estimate mean trends well but tend to underestimate uncertainty and to be overconfident in their estimates. In this context, engineering judgment should be based on a demonstrable chain of reasoning and not on speculation. One difficulty in interpreting results is that most people, including engineers, have difficulty establishing an allowable probability of failure or dealing with low values of probability. The F-N plot is one useful vehicle for comparing calculated probabilities with observed frequencies of failure of comparable facilities. In any comparison it must be noted that a calculated probability is a lower bound because it must fail to incorporate the factors that are ignored in the analysis. It is useful to compare probabilities of failure for alternative designs, and the reliability methods reveal the contributions of different components to the uncertainty in the probability of failure. Probability is not a property of the world but a state of mind; geotechnical uncertainty is primarily epistemic, Bayesian, and belief based. The current challenges to the profession are to make use of probabilistic methods in practice and to sharpen our investigations and analyses so that each additional data point provides maximal information. © ASCE.","Failures; Geotechnical engineering; Probability; Reliability; Risk analysis; Statistics; Uncertainty analysis","Data acquisition; Decision making; Error analysis; Natural frequencies; Probabilistic logics; Reliability; Risk assessment; Trees (mathematics); Reliability analysis; Spatial errors; Geotechnical engineering; Bayesian analysis; error analysis; geotechnical engineering; probability; reliability analysis","Christian, J.T.23 Fredana Rd., Waban, MA 02468, United States",,,10900241,,,,"English","J.

The geological discontinuity and groundwater information was obtained through a field program. The factor of safety of an example pit slope in the future Ryan Pit was determined using the limit equilibrium methods for plane and wedge failures, Sarma's method, and the local minimum factor of safety method. The shear strength parameters, c and φ, were estimated based on the first derivative of the maximum shear strength (tmax) of rock mass with various degrees of quality. The analysis indicated that the example pit slope would have an overall safety factor above 1.0, under most of the conditions analyzed. However, the slope with RMR=14 would become critical, if water filled the crack. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.","Discontinuity; Mine; RMR; Rock mass; Slope; Stability","Cracks; Groundwater; Mining; Safety factor; Shear strength; Groundwater information; Slope instability; Rock mechanics; opencast mining; safety; shear strength; slope angle; slope stability; Alaska; Fairbanks; North America; United States","Huang, S.L.; Dept. of Mining/Geol.

The field work consisted of geological, engineering-geological, hydrogeological and local geophysical surveys. In the first stage, a landslide map was compiled and used as the basis for the landslide hazard assessment map. For the elaboration of the landslide hazard assessment map, eight criteria with a decisive influence on slope stability were taken into consideration: lithology, geomorphology, structure and tectonics, hydrology and climate, hydrogeology, seismicity, forest cover and human activity. Additional detailed geophysical surveys (seismic and geoelectric) were conducted in two selected areas to refine the depth and surface information. The landslide hazard assessment map was compiled after processing the complex raw data. The map reveals that the studied area in the Muntenia Subcarpathians is a high risk area for landslides.

In order that geologic chance of success might be calculated using a new probabilistic risking scale, a description of the geological framework is presented both in terms of play characteristics and the dependence on setting between geologic risk factors. Probabilistic volumetric evaluation and expected monetary value were calculated for each of the targets in a 3-D seismic prospect portfolio by assigning probability distributions to geological, engineering, and economical characteristics. Monte Carlo simulation was also applied so that uncertainty could be modeled for probabilistic input values. Finally, an efficient frontier analysis was generated by building optimal portfolios having various degrees of risk. Efficient portfolios are built by applying linear programming as an optimization tool. The balance between value and risk is considered for an optimal working interest to be obtained that fits investor constraints and risk attitude instead of a net-present-value ranking being used. This trade-off maximizes value and minimizes risk for the entire portfolio. Prospect risk is modeled as chance of loss, or semi-standard deviation, and value is defined as the mean expected monetary value derived from probabilistic economical evaluation. A new geologic probabilistic risking scale was developed that adds standardization to the Monte Carlo simulation of geologic probability of success. This scale improves on previous methods by taking into account the uncertainty in judgment, as well as the quantity and quality of available information. The methodology presented in this paper combines optimal portfolio management with probabilistic risk-analysis methodology, thus helping to guide management in evaluating a portfolio of exploration prospects, not just according to their value, but also by their inherent risk. This practical analysis is simple to apply using economical tools such as spreadsheets and Monte Carlo simulation software.",,"Net present value (NPV); Portfolio management; Computer simulation; Computer software; Drilling; Geology; Hydrocarbons; Industrial management; Linear programming; Monte Carlo methods; Optimization; Petroleum industry; Probability distributions; Project management; Risk management; Seismology; Petroleum engineering","BJ Services",,,,,PSHSF,,"English","SPE Hydrocarbon Econ Eval Symp",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1142303651

In the early 1960s, the coupling between hydraulic and mechanical processes in fractured rock started to receive wide attention. A series of events including dam failures, landslides, and injection- induced earthquakes were believed to result from HM interaction. Moreover, the advent of the computer technology in the 1970s made possible the integration of nonlinear processes such as stress-permeability coupling and rock mass failure into coupled HM analysis. Coupled HM analysis is currently being applied to many geological engineering practices. One key parameter in such analyses is a good estimate of the relationship between stress and permeability. Based on available laboratory and field data, it was found that the permeability of fractured rock masses tends to be most sensitive to stress changes at shallow depth (low stress) and in areas of low in-situ permeability. In highly permeable, fractured rock sections, fluid flow may take place in clusters of connected fractures which are locked open as a result of previous shear dislocation or partial cementation of hard mineral filling. Such locked-open fractures tend to be relatively insensitive to stress and may therefore be conductive at great depths. Because of the great variability of HM properties in fractured rock, and the difficulties in using laboratory data for deriving in-situ material properties, the HM properties of fractured rock masses are best characterized in situ.","Fractured rocks; Hydromechanical coupling; Mechanical; Permeability; Stress","fracture mechanics; groundwater; hydrogeology; hydromechanics; stress","Rutqvist, J.; Lawrence Berkeley National Lab., Earth Sciences Division, Berkeley, CA 94720, United States; email: jrutqvist@lbl.gov",,,14312174,,,,"English","Hydrogeol.

The stability during stable sliding or stick-slip was emphasized. Three types of polished fault surface are considered: (1) two surfaces with direct contact without any gouge in between, used to simulate the friction behavior of brittle fault; (2) the preset fault is filled with 0.25g quartz powder with a mean grain size of &lt;10μm, used to simulate the friction behavior of a fault containing brittle gouge; (3) the preset fault is filled with 0.25g clay fault gouge with grain size of &lt; 10 μm, used to simulate the friction behavior of a fault containing ductile gouge. The water content ranges from dry to water saturated, and the pore pressure ranges from 20 to 150MPa. The following conclusions can be drawn from the results of the experiment: (1) The mode of faulting is strongly influenced by the existence of water. For dry polished surfaces without any gouge, there is a certain range of confining pressure in which stick-slip behavior exists. This range of confining pressure may shrink quickly when water enters and forms pore pressure on sliding surface, i. e. the friction behavior turn to stable sliding. For samples with quartz powder, frictional behavior changes from stable sliding to stick-slip when dry gouge becomes wet, and return to stable sliding again when gouge is saturated and undrained. In this case, there also exists a certain range of confining pressure in which stick-slip behavior exists. For samples with clay gouge, frictional sliding keeps stable under any humidity and pore water pressure. (2) Experimental study also shows that stress drop of stick-slip is dependent on the water content. For samples without gouge, stress drop decreases with increasing water content in rock. For samples with quartz powder gouge, however, stress drop increases quickly at first and then slowly with increasing of water content in gouge under drained condition; under undrained condition, stress drop is small at first, then gets larger, and becomes small again when the content of water in gouge increases. When the samples are loaded with pore water pressure, frictional sliding turns to stable and the stress drop tends to zero. (3) Water influences the velocity dependence of frictional sliding of the tested rock samples. The velocity dependence of samples without gouge is velocity-weakening at any water content. For the samples filled with quartz powder, it is velocity-weakening when the water content ranges from dry to wet, i.e. at different humidity, and becomes velocity-strengthening when pore pressure exists on the fault; for the samples filled with clay fault gauge, it is always velocity-strengthening. (4) Based on velocity weakening model of friction instability and by considering the order of fault zone from no any gouge, to containing quartz powder gouge and clay gouge as a transition from brittle to ductile regimes, a conceptional model has been established for the relationship between the stability of faulting and the influential factors including fault property, water content and confining pressure (depth). Brittle fault displays velocity-weakening in most cases of various water contents, and stick-slip appears in the region of low water content, while stable-sliding appears when the water content becomes high (high pore pressure). Semi-brittle or semi-ductile fault displays velocity-weakening when water content is relatively low, and stick-slip may exist; but it will displays velocity-strengthening when high pore pressure appears, and the sliding will be stable. Ductile fault always displays velocity-strengthening at any water content, and the sliding is always stable. (5) A conclusion can be drawn from the experimental results of this study in the light of pore pressure theory: Entering of water will decrease the stability of the fault system but the existence of water may increase its stability; the former effect can be called ""mechanical effect of water"" and the latter can be called ""chemical effect of water"". These are two important aspects when we consider the influence of water or fluids on the stability of fault or rock mass. The ranges of confining pressure and pore pressure adopted in this study are comparable with the geological condition from ground surface to a depth of about 6km. Water appears as free water in this depth range. Therefore, these experimental results may provide an insight into the geological phenomena in shallow part of the crust-the mechanisms and prediction of earthquakes and geological engineering problems etc. For example, it can be used as the criteria of the effect of water on fault stability in numerical simulation of seismic activity, and can also used for analyzing the mechanism and activity of reservoir-induced earthquake. Some reservoir-induced earthquakes show that earthquake activity occurs only at the beginning of water storage or during the storaging period, then it becomes less and less. According to the results of this study, the former one is due to the ""mechanical effect of water"", and the latter is due to the ""chemical effect of water"".","Experimental study; Fault stability; Water effect","experimental study; faulting; friction; sliding; stick-slip; velocity; water","Huang, J.-G.; Institute of Geology, China Seismological Bureau, Beijing 100029, China; email: huang@gfz-potsdam.de",,,02534967,,,,"Chinese","Dizhen Dizhi",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036764140

K7L 3N6, Canada","Recent curriculum revisions to the geological engineering program at Queen's University at Kingston in Canada have led to a more streamlined program incorporating modern engineering education practices. Following a carefully designed program philosophy, the emphasis in the core curriculum changes through the entire four-year program in three progressive stages, from the acquisition of knowledge, to integration and analysis, and finally to synthesis and design. This is reflected in an increased concentration of mathematics and basic science courses in first and second year, engineering science courses in third year, and engineering design courses (capstone courses) in fourth year. Two tools which concisely illustrate the course curriculum and curriculum content are: (1) the flow sheet, which can contain a wealth of information, such as showing linkages between courses (e.g. how upper-level courses can build on lower-level courses through course prerequisites), the timing of various courses, courses taught within the home department (vs. other departments), and courses taught by professional engineers; and (2) the ternary phase diagram, which is a quantitative method of displaying engineering content within individual courses or an entire program and can clearly show patterns and trends in curriculum content with time. Such tools are useful for academic engineering programs which may have to undergo an accreditation review and are readily adapted to any other engineering fields of study. Other engineering elements woven throughout the program include strong interactions with professional engineering faculty, the use of student teams, enhanced communication skills, and exposure to important aspects of professional engineering practice such as engineering ethics and law. To ensure that the curriculum is kept current and relevant, formative evaluation instruments such as questionnaires are used in all years of study, and are also sent to recent graduates of the program. External reviews of the revised program have been positive, indicating that the program goals are being achieved.",,"Engineering design; Engineering ethics; Engineering students; Questionnaires; Engineering education; Engineers; Geology; Phase diagrams; Professional aspects; Soil mechanics; Students; Thermodynamics; Curricula","Lee, J.K.W.; Department of Geological Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, Ont.

Undeveloped deposits of common minerals in many cases are situated in the conflicting areas because of their high natural values or development needs. There is an urgent requirement for evaluation of local mineral resources, which shall lead to their protection or deleting from national resource balance sheet and leaving them free for non-mining land use. Turning of brownfields into vital community assets must be guided by assessment and valorization of natural and man-affected environment, taking into account the geological-engineering conditions, hydrogeology and hydrography including their expected changes, soil types and their contamination, dumpsites. These elements have already been presented on synthetic geopotential maps for environmental management, on hydrogeological and geochemical maps, as well as on the maps presenting impact and degradation of the Earth's surface, which facilitates delimitation and assessment of conflict areas and land-use planning. The core of the paper deals with the diagnosis of the environment and forecast of its changes after ceasing of mining activity. The closure of mines, which were major suppliers of drinking and industrial water, needs opening of new water intakes and introduction of protection measures against their contamination. Redeveloping of brownfields is a serious new target for local governments and regional administration. It needs concerted action much broader than during standard mine reclamation. Expectations for initiatives, scientific support and implementation are directed to high schools and professional geologists, e.g. via the Geological Society of Poland.","Brownfields development planning; Decision-making process; Geoenvironment assessment; Olkusz Zn-Pb ore district","abandoned mine; brownfield site; environmental assessment; lead; mining; reclaimed land; zinc; Poland","Paulo, A.; Katedra Geol.

The most interesting applications are: The determination of the fluctuations of the piezometric levels in groundwater to evaluate hydrogeological resources, the study of recent hydrothermal manifestations, the study of oil- and gas- bearing regions, the estimation of uranium deposits and the study of the relationship between the radon concentration and the degree of stress of the earth's crust at different stages of seismic activity. Waters from springs and deep wells in the plateau of Tassili (southeast Algeria) were sampled, measured and radon quantified. Radon measurements were performed using two different methods. The first method, active, based on the use of a Lucas-type scintillation chamber in conjunction with a portable monitor (model Pylon AB- 5); the second method, passive, using an electret ion chamber with a 41 glass analysis bottle. The aim of this work is to develop a method for sampling, detecting, evaluating and measuring the 222Rn in groundwater using the scintillation cell method. A comparison of the two methods was carried out and both were found to be useful under environmental conditions in Algeria.

First of all, it is necessary to create a database of the archaeological wealth and an analysis of the geomorphologic processes interacting on them. This activity employs the Arc/Info (© ESRI Inc.) software in which the database is included for organising and georeferring all the information obtained with the direct survey analysis. All the geomorphologic processes influencing the archaeological sites (both on slopes and flood plain) were analysed to highlight the temporal and spatial distribution of elements that are threatened. The use of Geographic Information Systems provides the most effective procedure for a global and integrated analysis on the site information and on the intrinsic and external conditions of potential instability. Afterwards, the cases of hydrogeologic hazard are investigated applying geological engineering methods in order to indicate the main causes of instability and the possible remedial measures. © 2000 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.","Cultural heritage; Geographic information system; Geomorphologic mapping; Hydro-geological hazard; Risk assessment",,"Canuti, P.; Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra, Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Via G.

Problems of Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Pushchino, 142292, Russian Federation","This article presents a review of the combined analysis of digital terrain models (DTMs) and remotely sensed data in landscape investigations. The utilization of remotely sensed data with DTMs has become an important trend in geomatics in the past two decades. Models of more than ten quantitative topographic variables are employed as ancillary data in the treatment of images. The article reviews the methods for DTM derivation and the basic problems of DTM operation that are important for handling DTMs with imagery, namely: 1) the choice of a DTM network type; 2) DTM resolution; 3) DTM accuracy; and 4) the precise superimposition of DTMs and images. The processing of remotely sensed data and DTMs in combination is used in the following procedures: 1) the image correction of the topographic effect; 2) the correction of geometric image distortion; 3) image classification; 4) statistical and comparative analyses of landscape data; and 5) three-dimensional landscape modelling. These procedures are applied to solve a wide range of problems in geobotany, geochemistry, soil science, geology, glaciology and other sciences. The joint use of imagery and DTMs can increase the total amount of information extracted from both types of data. The trend has been towards the incorporation of the combined analysis of remotely sensed data and DTMs into mixed environmental models. The following potential applications of the treatment of imagery in association with DTMs are identified: 1) the prediction of the migration and accumulation zones of water, mineral and organic substances moved by gravity along the land surface and in the soil; 2) the investigation of the relationships between topographically expressed geological structures and landscape properties; 3) the improvement of geological engineering in industrial planning (e.g., the construction of nuclear power stations, oil and gas pipelines and canals); and 4) the monitoring of existing industries. Digital models of plan, profile, mean and total accumulation curvatures, and nonlocal and combined topographic attributes should be included in data processing both to solve the problems indicated and to improve the outcome of some regular tasks (for example, the prediction of soil moisture distribution and fault recognition).","Digital terrain model; Image classification; Landscape study; Remote sensing; Topographic effect","DTM; image classification; remote sensing; topographic effect","Florinsky, I.V.; Inst. of Math.

In the magnetostrictive model a property of two degrees of freedom, that is, displacements was coupled to a property of one degree of freedom, that is, magnetic potential. To make this possible, non-quadratic coupling matrices had to be developed. This linear model was then verified against analytical solutions, with a good conceptual agreement.

This model was verified by comparing ghe differentiated step-response of the system calculated with the time propagation method, to the frequency function of the system, calculated with the harmonic model.

Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic rocks form a basinward thickening-wedge of sedimentary strata that reach a total thickness of 2,300 m in the southwest corner of the province. To date, oil production in Manitoba is restricted to the sandstones of the Jurassic Melita and Amaranth formations, the Mississippian Bakken Formation and the carbonates of the Mississippian Lodgepole and Mission Canyon formations. The deeper Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian formations - the Winnipeg, Red River, Stony Mountain, Interlake, Winnipegosis, Dawson Bay, Souris River, Duperow and Birdbear (Nisku) - offer oil and gas potential but remain largely undrilled. Manitoba enjoyed a resurgence in petroleum activity in 1993 and 1994. In total, 184 wells were licensed over the last two years, compared to an annual average of 61 wells licensed over the previous five years. Over 70% of the Crown land currently under disposition has been leased at land sales during the past two years. Low Crown land price is one competitive advantage enjoyed by Manitoba producers. Other advantages include: low drilling and completion costs, low drilling density, a competitive and stable fiscal regime, drilling and exploration incentives, and unrestricted access to markets.

High exchange capacity of a water molecule with its dipole property creates excessive swelling in smectite group clay minerals. The swelling in turn, may cause serious geotechnical problems. Moreover, permeability test with water in vadose zone of clay bearing units give erroneous 'K' (m/s) values. However, compressed gas test can provide reliable results. Persistent discontinuities form the main features which define engineering characteristics and control the distribution of geotechnical parameters. Geological, engineering, and geotechnical models have significant role in performing a reliable geotechnical design. A sound preparation of models becomes more challenging and reliability of each model is influenced from that of the former.

Over the next five years, the process evolved into an effective method to plan exploration programs on a basis of value incorporating prospect ranking, budget allocation, and technology management. The final product is a continuous process and includes, within a single organizational unit, the integration of geologic risk assessment, probabilistic distribu tion of prospect hydrocarbon volumes, engineering development planning, and prospect economics. The process is based on the concepts of the play and hydrocarbon system. Other steps of the process (geologic risk assessment, volumetric estimation, engineering support, economic evaluation, and postdrill feedback) are considered extensions of fundamental knowledge and understanding of the underlying geological, engineering, and fiscal constraints imposed by these concepts. A foundation is set, describing the geologic framework and the prospect in terms of the play concept - source, reservoir, trap (including seal), and dynamics (timing/migration). The information and data from this description become the basis for subsquent steps in the process. Risk assessment assigns a probability of success to each of these four elements of the play concept, and multiplication of these probabilities yields the probability of geologic success. A well is considered a geologic success if a stabilized flow of hydrocarbons is obtained on test. Volumetric estimation expresses uncertainty in a distribution of possible hydrocarbon volumes for the prospect constructed from ranges of parameters obtained from information specific to the prospect, and data described by the parent play concept. With this distribution, engineering support provides development scenarios for three cases - a pessimistic case (10%), the mean, and an optimistic case (90%). Economic evaluation is run for each of the three cases, thus providing a range of economic consequences of the geological, engineering, and fiscal framework. Commercial risk is based on the results of this evaluation, and overall probability of success is the multiplication of the probability of geologic success and probability of commercial success. Postdrill feedback determines whether the individual processes are providing predicted results consistent with actual outcomes.",,"Industrial economics; Petroleum geology; Petroleum prospecting; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Probability; Risk assessment; Strategic planning; Value engineering; Exploration prospect ranking; Geologic risk assessment; Probabilistic hydrocarbon volume distribution; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; hydrocarbon exploration; hydrocarbon potential","Chevron Overseas Petroleum, Inc., P.O.

As a results of this study 4 wells have been drilled as producers during 1995 resulting in an additional 7.5 MMBO reserves. The initial production rate of these wells was approximately 12,500 BOPD. In addition, one injector was drilled and two wells have been converted to injection to improve both vertical and areal sweep. Post appraisal of new wells was performed.

Bȩdzińska 60, 41-200 Sosnowiec, Poland","In 1994 year exactly 150 years past since the first large-scale (1 : 50 000) geological map (geognostic) of the Upper Silesian region (Carnall, 1844) had been published. Since that time about 30 different geological maps of this region has been published in scales from 1 : 300 000 to 1 : 25 000 (Czarnocki, 1935). The large scale maps (1 :50 000 and 1 : 25 000) and geological atlases (1 :100 000) contained from a few to tens of series sheets (vide Figs 1, 2). Most of those maps were treated as secret or confidential documents thus they were unknown for foreign geologists. Cartographic-geological works carried out on the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB) can be divided into three main periods (Lewandowski et aL, 1995). The first period - the pioneer one includes the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century (to 1913). The Geognostische Karte von Ober-Schlesien in scale 1:100 000 (Roemer, 1870) and Geological Atlas of Galicia, of which three sheets: Oświȩciin, Chrzanów and Cracow were worked out by Zarȩczny (1894), made the most remarkable achievement in geological cartography of that period. The Upper Silesian sheets of Geologische Karte von Preussen, published in scale 1:25 000 (Fig. 2) by Assmann, Cromer, Michael, Tornau, Quitzow, Range (1913) deserve special distinction. Geologische U″Übersichts Karte des Oberschleshchen Steinkohlenreviers..., supplemented with synthetic work Die Geologie des Oberschlesischen Steinkohlenbezirkes (1913) was the regional recapitulation of the USCB geological mapping of the first period. The second period (1935-1972) was a continuation of detailed and synthetic regional works. Doktorowicz-Hrebnicki was the main cartograph of that period, together with a team of geologists mapping the eastern part of the USCB. Unfortunately, most of the large scale geological-cartographic elaborations of that time was not published, because of the secrecy of geological data. These were mainly structural maps of coal-bearing Carboniferous and others different types of documentation maps of mines. In the post-war period (1955-1995) most of geological-cartographic elaborations were limited only to the modification of already existing, large scale maps, and in case of need to regional synthesis construction, on maps in scales 1 : 100 000 and 1: 200 000; apart from Doktorowicz-Hrebnicki cartographic work being the only exception from the rule. Sketch Geological Map of Poland, sheet Cracow in scale 1 : 300 000 by Doktorowicz-Hrebnicki and Rozycki (edition A - 1948 and B -1955) was the recapitulation of cartographic elaborations as a regional synthesis. This map made the grounds for further editions: Sketch Geological-Engineering Map (1955), Sketch Hydrogeological Map - A (1963) and B (1969), and Sketch Map of Rock Resources (1964). The Hydrological Map of the USCB, in scale 1 : 100 000 (1963) was also elaborated on the base of geological maps of Doktorowicz-Hrebnicki. In 1955-1960 almost the whole area of the USCB was covered by several sheets of Detail Geological Map of Poland in scale 1:50 000. These maps were elaborated availing the possibility of modification of the existing, geological maps. Unluckily they kept a part of geological data in secrecy in relation to originals, and were considerably simplified as well. Next years fructified with the elaboration of lacking sheets, and nowadays only the southern part of the USCB is devoid of the detailed geological mapping (Fig. 2). Within Geological Map of Poland in scale 1 : 200 000, two sheets of the USCB appeared: Gliwice (1979) and Cracow (1980), which gave the opportunity to the next regional synthesis. The map just mentioned contains two editions A - a surface map and B - a map without Quaternary deposits, both with an explanatory text and general data (colourless sheet maps in scale 1 : 50 000). As a result of Geological Atlas of the USCB in scale 1 : 100 000, elaborated by Polish Geological Institute, a few maps of great worth were printed. In the early 80s two maps were printed: Geothermal Map and Map of Coal Quality, in 1980 and in 1983 respectively. In 1994 the Structural Map of Carboniferous was printed and in 1995 Geochemical Atlas of the USCB in scale 1 : 200 000. All of them are sketch maps and of regional synthesis type. The Upper Silesian Coal Basin acquires over 200 geological documentations of different type. The mining areas posses hand-written maps (in scale 1 : 25 000 and 1 : 5 000) of the whole USCB. Apart from a large number of maps and elaborations, the region is still lacking in a complex detailed geological map in scale 1 : 25 000. Such map would enable full utilisation of the existing documentation and comprehensive presentation of complex geological ore deposits and geognostical problems of the USCB.",,"cartography; geological mapping; historical development; regional geology; Poland, Upper Silesian Coal Basin","Jura, D.; Wydział Nauk o Ziemi, Uniwersytet Śla̧ski, ul.

Initial experiments were conducted on the floor of a quarry in southern Switzerland from which ornamental gneissic rock is extracted. During a brief two-day period, constant-offset georadar data were recorded over a 650 m2 area with a grid cell size of 0.1 m × 0.2 m. Georadar velocities were estimated from the results of expanding spread surveys. All georadar data and associated geometry files were recorded automatically in seismic industry formats. The experimental georadar data set was processed, image-enhanced, and interpreted using 3-D seismic reflection software operating on a workstation. Arbitrary vertical sections, time slices, 3-D images, and animated movies in which the observer ""travels"" through the entire data volume were constructed from the resultant migrated georadar data. Semi-automatic tracking routines allowed continuous subhorizontal reflections to a maximum depth of 30 m to be mapped through the rock mass. These reflections, which are characterized by negative polarity onsets, are probably caused by a system of ubiquitous water-filled fractures, 2-4 cm thick. Volumes of rock bounded by the subhorizontal fractures were estimated from isopach maps and rock quality was assessed on the basis of root-mean-square (rms) amplitudes of reflections. An extension of a steep-dipping fault exposed on a nearby quarry wall was best delineated on maps representing the horizontal gradients of reflection times. To synthesize in a single figure the principal geological results of the study, picked reflection times were presented in the form of shaded relief surfaces, in which remarkably vivid structural details of the subhorizontal fractures and intersecting near-vertical fault could be discerned. It is concluded that 3-D georadar methods have the potential to resolve a wide range of engineering and environmental problems.",,"Computer aided analysis; Data structures; Electromagnetic wave reflection; Image processing; Rocks; Seismology; Three dimensional; Velocity measurement; Data flow analysis; Faulting; Fracture; Geology; Ground penetrating radar systems; Quarries; Radar; Radar imaging; Rocks; Seismology; Georadar data set; Gneiss; Ground penetrating radar; Seismic reflection; Radar imaging; Geological surveys; engineering geology; fracture imaging; gneiss; GPR; ground penetrating radar; Switzerland; Engineering applications; Environmental problems; Ground Penetrating Radar; Horizontal gradients; Negative polarity; Seismic industry; Seismic reflections; Structural details","Grasmueck, M.; Shell Intl.

The boundary element method is ideally suited for modelling problems in rock mechanics because of the requirement to descretize surfaces only. This contrasts with the volume discretization needed for the finite element method, finite difference method and the distinct element method. The disadvantage of the boundary element method is that the rock mass is assumed to be isotropic and elastic. However, it is possible to model the non-linear behaviour on fault planes by using the concept of multiple regions and by connecting these regions via non-linear springs or Goodman type joint elements. The disadvantage of this method has been that joint stiffnesses have to be specified and that a great number of iterations are needed because the stiffness coefficient of a spring may change very rapidly from a very high value (for example when a joint is in compression) to a very low value (when a joint is in tension). This paper describes a novel method for the treatment of faults with the boundary element method which eliminates the need to specify joint stiffness parameters and which is able to model signi fault movement with very few iterations. The numerical scheme makes very effecient use of computer resources because the non-linear iterations only involve degrees of freedom at the interfaces. Examples of applications of the new model to practical problems in mining and geological engineering are given. © 1994.",,"boundary element method; Boundary Element Method; Computer Program; faulted rock; Faults; Mathematical Models; nonlinear behaviour; rock mechanics; Boundary element method; Computer applications; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Finite difference method; Finite element method; Geologic models; Interfaces (materials); Iterative methods; Mathematical models; Mining; Stiffness; Surfaces; Faulted rock; Joint stiffness parameters; Multiregion boundary element method; Nonlinear iterations; Rock mass; Surface discretization; Rock mechanics","Beer, G.; Institut für Baustatik, University of Technology, Graz, Austria",,,01489062,,,,"English",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028524582

Rock salt formations are particularly suitable for the construction of cavities for such purposes. Owing to its favourable geomechanical properties, rock salt remains stable over long periods of time without support, and it can be shown that the geological barrier of the host rock remains intact for a remarkably long time. Safety analysis must be made for each proposed site based on site-specific data. The methods of doing this are well known and related technical recommendations exist in Germany. These recommendations apply to the planning, construction, operation and post-operational management of salt caverns used for the underground disposal of hazardous wastes. In particular, geotechnical site-specific safety verification, as required by the government's technical regulations on wastes (TA-Abfall) under the section ""Underground Disposal"", is required. This safety verification must cover the entire system comprising the waste, the cavern and the surrounding rocks. For this purpose geomechanical models have to be developed. The steps which must be taken when carrying out geological engineering site explorations and when determining geotechnical parameters are discussed. In addition, recommendations are made for the design and construction of underground repositories. For liquid-filled caverns, long-term sealing from the biosphere is of particular interest. In this instance it must be shown that the natural increase in pressure in the closed cavity due to long-term convergence does not exceed the fracture pressure. A special filled test (scale 1:1) has been performed to study this. © 1993.",,"Petroleum; Salt Caverns; Storage; Underground Storge; Waste Disposal; engineering geology; oil and gas storage; rock salt; toxic waste disposal; underground storage; Chemicals; Geological repositories; Rock salt formations; Salt deposits; Solution-mined caverns; Toxic waste disposal; Waste technical regulations; Waste disposal","Langer, M.; Bundesanstalt für Geowissenschaften un Rohstoffe, Alfred-Bentz-Haus, Postfach 510153, 30631 Hannover 51, Germany",,,00137952,,EGGOA,,"English","Eng.

The Guide analyzes, in a systemic perspective, the sequence of exploration, development, and evaluation work required to bring a mineral deposit to production. The aim is to identify the metal/mineralization losses and ore dilution that each work step contributes to the evaluation and mining process. The procedure allows one to maximize the income and profits of a mining operation, and to reduce the risks of financial losses tied to investment decisions in the mining sector. For greater efficiency, the criteria of reserve estimation and classification should be integrated with the evaluation steps and methods. At earlier stages of deposit development, when quantitative knowledge is available mainly on the geological axis, the term 'delimited mineral deposit' should be used. The term 'reserve' should be used only in an operating mine or in a mining project, when information in the geological, engineering, and economic domains is adequate to ensure technical and financial feasibility. 'Reserves' are by definition 'mining reserves'. Each category of proven/probable reserves and measured/indicated deposits should be subdivided into two classes to express better the many steps of mineral valuation. The category of 'possible reserves' shall be replaced by that of 'inferred mineralization'. This system, derived from the Australasian Code, can easily be integrated into current practices of the exploration and mining industry within a short timeframe. The proposal to develop the use of the margins of error of the estimates at a confidence level of 90% should be viewed in a longer timeframe.

Kiliclar group basalts are more variable and exhibit alkaline, tholeiitic and calc-alkaline basalt types with varied phenocryst assemblages. Apart from a few tholeiites with enriched-MORB affinities, the majority of the alkaline and tholeiitic basalts are representative of oceanic islands. The calc-alkaline basalt megaclasts are geographically restricted in the Kiliclar unit and may represent fragmentation of a continental margin or arc originally part of the Sakarya continental slab within Neo-Tethys.

Even an adept planner who may have to resolve conflicts may find that coping with the flood is beyond his capacity. For this reason, the contributions from the geosciences have to be clear-cut, the language of explanation must be easily understandable, and the map arrangements should be clear and precise. The Geoscientifíc Map of the Natural Environment’s Potential (GMNEP) was prepared and published by the Geological Survey in Hannover, Federal Republic of Germany, and adapted by the IUGS Map Commission for that purpose. It consists of a basal set of maps, such as geological, soil and ground-water maps, surficial-and subsurface-resources maps and geological-engineering maps. In a second step, these maps are translateďinto land-use claim maps, indicating the specific possibilities of land use. When such claim maps are placed one over the other, areas of conflict become apparent between the various interests involved in the utilization of the environmental potential. As a final step in making preparations for planning, a GMNEP Utilization Map (GMNEPU) is prepared from these conflict maps. This final map is the contribution of the geoscientists to planning - an interpretation of the facts at their command in a form more comprehensible to the planner than ever before. □ Environmental geology, land-use planning, geoscientifíc maps, geological maps, land-use claim maps. © 1979 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Federal Republic of Germany; Geological Survey; Geoscientific Map of the Natural Environment's Potential (GMNEP); Hannover; IUGS Map Commission",,,,11035897,,,,"English","GFF",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0018662576

The development of sulfate karstic shores on reservoirs differs fundamentally from the development of shores composed of sand-gravel rocks. 2. Reworking of karstic shores occurs mainly due to solution of rock. Since they consist of 85-95% CaSO4. 2H2O, no abrasion shoal is formed near the shores. Clay particles in suspension are carried away into the reservoir. 3. The unique character of shore destruction and the absence of inshore shoals (benches) cause the unabating rate of the process. 4. The linear relation between the volume of caved and dissolved rocks and time permits predicting destruction of a previously unobserved section of the shore, which is especially important for occassional geological engineering investigations on the shores of reservoirs. © 1969 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,,,,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",00188220,,,,"English","Hydrotech.
