This pyroclastic flow partially covered the Liyangan archeological site, a site where Hindu temples were constructed approximately 1,000 years ago. Five samples of charcoal collected from this area were analyzed for reflectance and elemental composition. Charcoalification temperatures were determined based on mean random optical reflectance values (Ro) plotted on published Ro-Temperature curves. Charcoalification temperatures were also estimated using a published formula based on the charcoal's hydrogen to carbon (H/C) ratio. These two methods for determining pyroclastic flow deposition temperatures indicated that the pyroclastic deposits that entombed the Liyangan archeological site ranged from 295° to 487°C when they were deposited. This study used very simple, rapid, precise, and low-cost methods of charcoalification temperature measurement to infer the emplacement temperature of a pyroclastic deposit. This estimation procedure could be applied widely to predict emplacement temperatures in volcanic area in Indonesia to enhance volcanic hazard mitigation. © IJOG - 2018.","Charcoal; Liyangan archeological site; Pyroclastic flow deposition temperature; Sundoro Volcano",,"Harijoko, A.; Department of Geological Engineering, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Jln.

It can lead to hydrodynamically tilted hydrocarbon water contact, and open an opportunity of finding oil and gas in places where previously are not considered as potential traps. In this paper, some examples of the presence of hydrodynamic traps in Indonesia's sedimentary basin are discussed. Tilted hydrocarbon water contacts are present in some fields in the Lower Kutai Basin, and our interpretation is that regional lateral reservoir drainage is present in this basin and is responsible for the tilted contacts. It is also interpreted that lateral reservoir drainage leading to tilted hydrocarbon water contacts may be present at the Arun Field - North Sumatra Basin, Vorwata Field - Bintuni Basin, and BD Field - offshore East Java Basin. As most Indonesia's sedimentary basins are overpressured, the presence of lateral reservoir drainage driven by overpressure difference in the same stratigraphic unit is very plausible to occur, opening the opportunity for hydrodynamically tilted hydrocarbon water contact to be present. © IJOG - 2018.","Hydrodynamic; Lateral reservoir drainage; Lower Kutai Basin; Overpressure; Tilted hydrocarbon water contacts",,"Ramdhan, A.M.; Department of Geology and Department of Groundwater Engineering, Institute of Technology Bandung, Jln.

As many as 1709 tremors were recorded followed by continuous tremors appearing in late November 2014. Quasi-harmonic and gliding tremors appeared in a spectrogram on 12 November 2014. The quasi-harmonic tremors refer to tremors that have no fully harmonic form in spectrum. The gliding harmonic tremors refer to harmonic tremors that have frequency jumps with either positive or negative increment. After signal restitution processing, the Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis (MESA) method was applied in Raung recordings resulting the spectrum and the spectrogram of tremors. The quasi-harmonic tremors have the monotonic spectrum in its head and centre segment, and the harmonic one in its tails. There are twenty-four spectrums that show frequency changes between the monotonic and harmonic. The similarity between the fundamental frequency range of the monotonic and harmonic ones suggests that both signals are excited from a common resonator. The alternating of monotonic and harmonic respectively over this period is qualitatively similar with Julian's synthetic time series about the nonlinear oscillator model. It is suggested that Raung Volcano magma pressure is sizeable to make a chaotic vibration. A pressure increasing in Raung magmatic conduit causes the increasing of P-wave velocity and makes a positive gliding frequency. © IJOG - 2018.","Chaotic vibration; Harmonic; MESA; Monotonic; Nonlinear oscillator model",,"Ipmawan, V.L.; Department of Physics, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Jln.

Grafika No. 2 Bulaksumur, Yogyakarta, Indonesia","This study aims to understand the petrography and chemistry of both magmatic and hydrothermal biotites in porphyry copper-gold deposits, and to evaluate the fluid compositional changes during alteration processes. A total of 206 biotite grains from selected rock samples taken from the Batu Hijau porphyry Cu-Au deposit was analyzed. Detailed petrography and biotite chemistry analysis were performed on thin sections and polished thin sections, respectively, representing various rocks and alteration types. A JEOL JXA-8900R electron microprobe analyzer (EMPA) was used for the chemistry analysis. The biotite is texturally divided into magmatic and hydrothermal types. Ti, Fe, and F contents can be used to distinguish the two biotite types chemically. Some oxide and halogen contents of biotite from various rocks and alteration types demonstrate a systematic variation in chemical composition. Biotite halogen chemistry shows a systematic increase in log (XCl/XOH) and decrease in log (XF/XOH) values from biotite (potassic) through chlorite-sericite (intermediate argillic) to actinolite (inner propylitic) zones. The y-intercepts on the log (XCl/XOH) vs. XMg and log (XF/XOH) vs. XFe plotted for biotite from potassic and intermediate argillic zones are similar or slightly different. In contrast, the y-intercepts on the log (XCl/XOH) vs. XMg and log (XF/XOH) vs. XFe plotted for biotite from inner propylitic zone display different values in comparison to the two alteration zones. Halogen (F,Cl) fugacity ratios in biotite show a similar pattern: in the potassic and intermediate argillic zones they show little variation, whereas in the inner propylitic zone they are distinctly different. These features suggest the hydrothermal fluid composition remained fairly constant in the inner part of the deposit during the potassic and intermediate argillic alteration events, but changed significantly towards the outer part affected by inner propylitic alteration. High halogen content, particularly Cl, in hydrothermal biotite may portray that copper and gold were transported in mineralizing fluids in the form of chloride complexes CuCl2 - and AuCl2 -, respectively. © IJOG - 2018.","Biotite; Fluid composition change; Halogen F and Cl; Mineral chemistry; Petrography; Porphyry Cu-Au deposits",,"Idrus, A.; Department of Geological Engineering, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Jln.

Four facies were identified: upper shoreface, lower shoreface, offshore transition, and tidal ones. Stratigraphic correlation of eleven outcrops indicates that the upper shoreface sandstone is generally clean, well sorted, parallel, and planar cross laminated. The sand becomes thinner and pinches out to the northwest where the mud proportion increases within the sand. Muddier sand was deposited in a relatively low energy upper shoreface setting. The thickness of the upper shoreface reservoir sand generally is 5 m. It decreases to zero over approximately 1.3 km as the sand pinches out to the northwest. To the northeast, the thickness also decreases to 4 m over approximately 4 km. Permeability values are more variable laterally than vertically. The permeability distribution has an obvious relationship to the sedimentary facies and is mainly controlled by the proportion of mud and bioturbation. As the sand pinches out in the northwest, permeability decreases from 590 md to 97 md over 1 km. To the northeast, permeability also decreases to 152 md over approximately 4 km where the sand becomes highly bioturbated. These values indicate that the sands are of good to very good reservoir quality.

The geology of the studied area is composed of pre-Tertiary metamorphic, sedimentary, and igneous rocks which tectonically mixed forming a mélange complex. Located on the southeastern margin of Sundaland, the tectonic strongly influences the fracture occurrences in the studied area. A total of 3,841 fractures comprising shear fractures, extension fractures, veins, and joints have been measured and analyzed. The common fracture orientations are NW - SE, W - E, NNE - SSW, and ENE - WSW trends. Fractures developing in Bantimala have clearly been controlled by lithology and structure position (i.e. fault zones and fold hinge). The orientation of fractures in Bantimala area is different on each lithology, showing that the fracture system was complex. Fracture intensity in schist is higher compared to the other lithologies. The 3D fracture modeling through 3D geocellular modeling was generated using the result from field data measurements and analyses. Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) was built by fifty-one fracture sets that were analyzed from field measurement data. However, the estimation of average fracture porosity from modeling varies significantly depending on lithology. The value of fracture porosity is relatively small, varied from 0.0004 to 0.0029 %. A high fracture porosity number is observed in an area with a significant fracture intensity and most crosscutting of fracture which in turn is controlled by faults and lithology. A mélange complex can have high potential as a basement fractured reservoir target, where fracture distributions and their attributes will vary depending on the lithology as well as local deformation. © IJOG - 2017.","3D geocellular modeling; Bantimala Mélange Complex; Basement fractured reservoir; Discrete Fracture Network",,"Sapiie, B.; Geology Study Program, Faculty of Earth Sciences and Technology, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Jln Ganesha No. 10, Indonesia; email: bsapiie@gc.itb.ac.id",,"Geological Agency",23559314,,,,"English","Indones.

Highly weathered landforms cover the whole area. The Mesozoic sediments have experienced deep weathering, and currently present in the form of mesas. The weathering profiles are dominated by kaolinite, smectite, and pedogenic carbonates with some secondary silicification. Part of the landform is covered by colluvium varying in thickness from less than 1 m up to 12 m in certain places. Digital image processing has been done to ASTER imagery, i.e: calibrating, mosaicing, and band ratioing and false colour RGB.

The tin deposit in Karimun is related to the granitoid tin belt which extends from Myanmar to western Indonesia. Late Triassic Karimun Granite is composed of quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase, biotite, and/or muscovite with small amounts of accessory minerals. The granitoid unit is different with other felsic intrusive rocks in Malay Peninsular because of its A-type affinity although it is classified as part of the Tin Islands. All eight samples can be classified as altered rocks since the occurrence of secondary chlorite was identifed both macroscopically and microscopically. Petrography was used to describe the minerals that form the samples, whereas XRF and ICP-MS were used to study Karimun Granite from the geochemical point of view. Harker diagrams confirm that the granites show similarity to other granite units in Malaysia except for CaO. Whalen diagrams indicate the granite as A-type as well as the SiO2, REE, and LILE amounts. REE content in the weak peraluminous granitoid ranges from 183 to 3,296 ppm with Eu and Ce show negative anomalies in the REE spider diagram. Negative anomalies of Eu, Ba, Sr, P, and Ti in normalized spider plot also conclude that the studied granitoid indicates A-type.","A-type; Geochemistry; Karimun; REE; Tin belt",,"Irzon, R.; Centre for Geological Survey, Geological Agency, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Jln.

The reef-island is built from sediments that are entirely calcareous, resting on a platform of lithified coral conglomerate. The atoll rim is dominated by coralgal pavement consisting mainly of both encrusting and living coralline algae. The lagoon which is a semi-enclosed pool and opens to the eastern side, consists of sand and scattered corals.

A shear-wave splitting measurement was calculated by using Splitlab based on three methods simultaneously. The result of the shear-wave splitting measurement in the Sumatra Forearc and Fault Zone shows that there are two anisotropic layers. The first layer has a dominant-fast-polarization direction that is parallel with a trench, and has the delay time duration of 0.5 - 0.9 s-. It is presumed that it is caused by a shear-strain as a result of the existences of Mentawai and Sumatra Fault Zones. The second layer has a dominant-fast-polarization direction that is perpendicular to the trench with the delay time duration of about 1.1 - 1.9 s-. It is presumed that it is caused by a movement of a subduction plate on a mantle wedge. The measurement in the backarc shows that there is only one anisotropic layer that is a subduction plate. It is also found that there is a transition of an orientation change on the subduction plate between Sumatra and Java. The change of the polarization direction is probably related to the age difference and the direction velocity of the absolute plate movement (APM) from Sumatra to Java. © IJOG - 2017.","Back-arc; Fault zones; Forearc; Seismic anisotropy; Splitlab; Subduction zones",,"Candra, A.D.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Ronggolawe College of Technology (STTR Cepu), Jln.

A probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) is commonly used to assess the ground motion level expected with different likelihood at a rock site during a future seismic event. The Incorporating Monte Carlo method into PSHA in an intraplate region (i.e. Adelaide region) is an interesting topic to explore. The result of the analysis using this method is able to characterize the likelihood of seismicity in a targeted region. Furthermore, the results clearly display the seismic ground motions in term of peak ground acceleration and peak ground velocity in Adelaide region. The de-aggregation of the analysis suggests two expected severe events for the Adelaide City. The first expected event is an earthquake M5.2 from a distance of 15 km and 25 km from the city. The second expected one corresponds to an earthquake M6.6 occurring 85 km away from the Adelaide City.

Basically, two blocks separated by the Sumatra Fault do not have a significant difference in tectonic activity, but the tectonic activity change can be seen when the studied area is divided into three blocks (northwest, middle, and southeast), then the change in each part can clearly be seen. Apparently, the tectonic activity in the studied area starts from the southeast continues toward the northwest. It is proved by this research, that geomorphological parameters which are associated with mountain fronts and watershed systems demonstrate the value of the activity increases towards the northwest.

The rock sequence is composed of sand to clay grain sizes such as sandstone, quartz sandstone, calcareous sandstone, claystone, fossiliferous claystone, calcareous claystone, siltstone, and coal seam intercalations. The total thickness of the sequence is less than 200 m. Based on the fossil and palynology investigations, previous investigators concluded the age of the rock was Eocene to Middle Miocene. The geological structures developed in the rocks are the lithological stratification, fractures, folding, and faulting. The subsurface interpretation based on gravity data revealed the rock was located under the andesite breccias with 2.44 g/cc density. The density of the rock sequence was 2.63 g/cc. The gravity interpretation shows a strong indication that Nanggulan Formation underlies the andesitic breccias presumably associated with Old Andesite Formation exposed in Kulonprogo Mountains.

This research paper tries to formulate the concept of LVAs by taking into account the science and socio-economic aspects. A new approach in vulnerability concept is also introduced herein. To achieve this goal, a framework was designed for assessing the LVAs. The framework was formulated semiquantitatively through the development of database for the risk elements (human and properties) based on information from secondary data (technical reports), extensive review of literature, and field observations. The vulnerability parameters included in assessing LVAs are 1) physical implication (building structures, internal materials, property damage, infrastructural facilities, and stabilization actions), 2) social status (injury, fatalities, safety, loss of accommodation, and public awareness), and 3) interference on environment (affected period, daily operation, and diversity). Each considered parameter in the vulnerability assessment is allocated with a certain index value ranges from 0 (0 % damage/victims/period), 0.25 (1 - 25% damage/victims/period), 0.50 (26 - 50% damage/victims/period), 0.75 (51 - 75% damage/victims/period), and 1.00 (75 - 100% damage/victims/period). All of these parameters are compiled and analyzed with ""Landslide Distribution Map"" (LDM) to generate a ""Landslide Vulnerability Degree map (LVD)"". The LDM was produced based on field studies and satellite image interpretations in order to locate the landslide locations in the studied area. Finally, three types of physical, human, and environment vulnerabilities were then classified into five classes of vulnerabilities, namely: Class 1 ( < 0.20): Very Low Vulnerability; Class 2 (0.21 - 0.40): Low Vulnerability; Class 3 (0.41 - 0.60): Medium Vulnerability; Class 4 (0.61 - 0.80): High Vulnerability); and Class 5 ( > 0.81): Very High Vulnerability. Results from this study indicate that a further study is needed to the areas of high to very high vulnerability only. This LVAs approach is suitable as a guideline for preliminary development planning, controlling, and managing the landslide hazard /risk in the studied area and potentially to be extended with different background environments.","Landslide risk management; Malaysia; Risk elements; Vulnerability",,"Roslee, R.; Universiti Malaysia Sabah, UMS, Malaysia, Faculty of Science and Natural Resources, Jln., Malaysia; email: rodeano@ums.edu.my",,"Geological Agency",23559314,,,,"English","Indones.

A number of shallow groundwater samples were taken at several locations with a depth of 0 - 35 m. Based on geological data, shallow groundwater of Semarang alluvium is dominated by insertion of sand-gravel and sandy-clay with average porosity of around 56.0 %. This layer is thinning towards the south and then increasingly thickening to the north and north-east of the studied area. The results of the analyses show that the characteristics of shallow groundwater, i.e. approximately 51% of groundwater, still have the original composition as meteoric water and the remaining approximately 49% obtained a shift in the isotopic composition as caused by interaction with seawater and the little influence of evaporation. The results of chemical analysis of water indicates that in dry seasons, shallow groundwater aquifers in the Semarang City is dominated by chloride (Cl-) with NaCl of water type. While the parameters of bicarbonate, chloride, and Na/Cl ratio, shallow groundwater can be classified into two groups, namely unintruded groundwater around 51% spread from the foot hills to the south towards the hills with elevations of 9 - 142 m above sea level and intruded groundwater around 49% spread from the coastline to the urban direction.","Alluvium; Hydrochemistry; Salinization; Semarang; Shallow groundwater; Stable isotopes",,"Satrio; Centre for Applications of Isotope dan Radiation, BATAN, Jln.

However, no published petrogenetic study focuses mainly on these products. The Rombongan eruption in 1944 and Barujari eruptions in pre-1944, 1966, 1994, 2004, and 2009 produced basaltic andesite pyroclastic materials and lava flows. A total of thirty-one samples were analyzed, including six samples for each period of eruption except from 2004 (only one sample). The samples were used for petrography, whole-rock geochemistry, and trace and rare earth element analyses. The Rombongan and Barujari lavas are composed of calc-alkaline and high K calc-alkaline porphyritic basaltic andesite. The magma shows narrow variation of SiO2 content that implies small changes during its generation. The magma that formed Rombongan and Barujari lavas is island-arc alkaline basalt. Generally, data show that the rocks are enriched in Large Ion Lithophile Elements (LILE: K, Rb, Ba, Sr, and Ba) and depleted in High Field Strength Elements (HFSE: Y, Ti, and Nb) which are typically a suite from a subduction zone. The pattern shows a medium enrichment in Light REE and relatively depleted in Heavy REE. The processes are dominantly controlled by fractional crystallization and magma mixing. All of the Barujari and Rombongan lavas would have been produced by the same source of magma with little variation in composition caused by host rock filter process. New flux of magma would likely have occurred from pre-1944 until 2009 period that indicates slightly decrease and increase of SiO2 content. The Rombongan and Barujari lava generations show an arc magma differentiation trend. © IJOG - 2016.","Basaltic-andesite; Fractional crystallization; Lava; Magma mixing; Post-caldera",,"Rachmat, H.; Faculty of Geology, Padjadjaran University, Jln.

The Gunung Bijih (Ertsberg) Mining District (GBMD) is located in the Central Range of Papua, in the western half of the island of New Guinea. This study presents the results of detailed structural mapping concentrated on analyzing fault-slip data along a 15-km traverse of the Heavy Equipment Access Trail (HEAT) and the Grasberg mine access road, providing new information concerning the deformation in the GBMD and the Cenozoic structural evolution of the Central Range. Structural analysis indicates that two distinct stages of deformation have occurred since ~12 Ma. The first stage generated a series of en-echelon NW-trending (π-fold axis = 300°) folds and a few reverse faults. The second stage resulted in a significant left-lateral strike-slip faulting sub-parallel to the regional strike of upturned bedding. Kinematic analysis reveals that the areas between the major strike-slip faults form structural domains that are remarkably uniform in character. The change in deformation styles from contractional to a strike-slip offset is explained as a result from a change in the relative plate motion between the Pacific and Australian Plates at ~4 Ma. From ~4 - 2 Ma, transform motion along an ~ 270° trend caused a left-lateral strike-slip offset, and reactivated portions of pre-existing reverse faults. This action had a profound effect on magma emplacement and hydrothermal activity. © IJOG - 2016.","Central Range Papua; Erstberg Mining District; Fault-slip; Kinematic analysis",,"Sapiie, B.; Geology Study Program, Faculty of Earth Sciences and Technology, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Jln.

Mineralogy of Se-type deposits at Pongkor, Cikidang, Cibaliung, Cisungsang, and Cirotan and Te-type deposits at Arinem and Cineam shows their different geochemical characteristics. Mineralogical and geochemical differences can be explained by variation of physico-chemical conditions that existed during gold-silver deposition by applying the phase relation among sulfide, telluride, and selenide mineral association in the deposits. The relative values of fSe2(g), fTe(g), and fS2(g) control the actual presence of selenide or telluride minerals within the West Java deposits, which also depend on their concentrations in the hydrothermal fluid. Even though the concentration of selenium in the hydrothermal fluid of Te-type deposits might have been similar or even higher than that in the Se-type, early substitution of selenium in the sulfide minerals prevents its concentration in the hydrothermal fluid to the levels for precipitating selenide minerals. Therefore, early sulfide mineral deposition from reduction fluids will not increase the fSe2(g)/fS2(g) ratio to form selenide minerals in Te-type deposits of Arinem and Cineam, other than selenium-bearing sulfide mineral such as Se-bearing galena or Se-bearing pyrargyrite-proustite. © IJOG - 2016.","Fugacity; Hydrothermal; Mineralization; Selenium; Substitution; Tellurium",,"Yuningsih, E.T.; Faculty of Geology, Padjadjaran University, Jln.

This paper presents the results of a field survey conducted to map the surface rupture and geotechnical phenomena associated with the ground shaking during the July 2, 2013 earthquakes in Tanah Gayo Highland. The objectives of this survey are to document and to characterize the surface ruptures as well as to identify types of earthquake-induced ground failures. Results of the survey identified four best sites of possible surface rupture. Two locations are obvious surface ruptures that can be traced on primary topographic feature of the active fault segment from the north to the south, crossing Pantan Terong Hill. The fault segment has a total mapped length of 19 km, with WNW trending zone and a dextral rupture offset. The ground shaking also resulted in landslides and liquefaction in areas underlain by very fine-grained tuffaceous sands. Based on the field survey, it can be concluded that the newly defined active fault segment, the Pantan Terong segment, is likely the segment that ruptured at the July 2, 2013 Tanah Gayo earthquake. Due to the soil types and unstable rocky slopes in the hilly Central Aceh region, large-scale landslides are primary risks during an earthquake event in this region. © IJOG - 2016.","Active fault; Ground failure; Sumatran Fault; Surface rupture; Tanah Gayo earthquake",,"Daryono, M.R.; Research Center for Geotechnology, Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI), Jln.

The groundwater exploited in deep wells is concentrated in confined aquifers. The previous hydrogeological model was developed in one unit of aquifer and refined then by using several hydrostratigraphical units following a regional hydrogeological map without any further analysis. At present, there is a lack of precise hydrogeological model which integrates geological and hydrogeological data, in particular for multiple aquifers in Semarang. Thus, the aim of this paper is to develop a hydrogeological model for the multiple aquifers in Semarang using an integrated data approach. Groundwater samples in the confined aquifers have been analyzed to define the water type and its lateral distribution. Two hydrogeological cross sections were then created based on several borelog data to define a hydrostratigraphical unit (HSU). The HSU result indicates the hydrogeological model of Semarang consists of two aquifers, three aquitards, and one aquiclude. Aquifer 1 is unconfined, while Aquifer 2 is confined.

The study area is located in the southern part of the Bayat Complex. Administratively, it belongs to Central Java Province and Yogyakarta Special Province. The lithology of Bayat is very complex, composed of various kinds of igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic, and volcanic rocks. Most of previous researchers interpreted Bayat as a melange complex constructed within a subduction zone. Kebo-Butak is one of formations that forms the Bayat field complex. The formation is composed of basalt, layers of pumice, tuff, shale, and carbonaceous tuff. Most of them are known as volcanic rocks. These imply that volcanic activities are more probable to construct the geology of Bayat rather than the subducted melange complex. The geological mapping, supported by geomorphology, petrology, stratigraphy, and geological structures, had been conducted in a comprehensive manner using the deduction-induction method. The research encounters basalt, black pumice, tuff with basaltic glasses fragments, zeolite, argilic clay, as well as feldspathic- and pumice tuff. Petrographically, the basalt is composed of labradorite, olivine, clinopyroxene, and volcanic glass. Black pumice and tuff contain prismatic clinopyroxene, granular olivine, and volcanic glasses. Feldspathic tuff and pumice tuff are crystal vitric tuff due to more abundant feldspar, quartz, and amphibole than volcanic glass. Zeolite comprises chlorite and altered glasses as deep sea altered volcanic rocks. The geologic structure is very complex, the major structures are normal faults with pyrite in it. There were two deep submarine paleovolcanoes namely Tegalrejo and Baturagung. The first paleovolcano erupted effusively producing basaltic sequence, while the second one erupted explosively ejecting feldspathic-rich pyroclastic material.

In addition, records from these tropical areas are limited compared to other areas of subtropical and polar regions. The aim of this study is to reconstruct Cenozoic paleoceanography, in particular nutrient level, using outcrop samples from Kali Pasir, Banyumas, Indonesia. This study is focused on the relationships of the relative abundance of Discoaster, coccolith size of Reticulofenestra, and lithofacies characteristics. Nutrient level is reconstructed using quantitative analysis of calcareous nannofossil by counting calcareous nannofossils on 400 fields of View (FOV) for each sample. The abundance of Discoaster and the large Reticulofenestra represent a deep thermocline and nutricline, which is a typical of oligotrophic condition. This condition also associated with the muddy facies in the early stages of Late Miocene (NN8-NN10a). Conversely, decreasing Discoaster abundance and the abundance of small Reticulofenestra indicate a shallow thermocline and nutricline, resulting strong eutrophication of surface waters in the later stage of Late Miocene (NN10b-NN11). A high nutrient content in this stage is related to classical turbidite deposits. A change in a sea surface resulted in strong eutrophication, which is in this section similar to the eastern Indian Ocean micropaleontology records during the Late Miocene (NN10). This finding shows that strong eutrophication in Kali Pasir section is probably driven by nutrient-rich terrestrial material related to the onset of Indian monsoon during the Late Miocene. © IJOG - 2016.","Classical turbidite; Late Miocene; Nannofossil; Nutrient level",,"Hendrizan, M.; Research Centre for Geotechnology LIPI, Kompleks LIPI, Jln.

In this study, the vast amount of seismic and well data were integrated and reinterpreted to define the key structural events in the Nam Con Son Basin. The results show that the basin has undergone two extentional phases. The first N - S extensional phase terminated at around 30 M.a. forming E - W trending grabens which are complicated by multiple half grabens filled by Lower Oligocene sediments. These grabens were reactivated during the second NW - SE extension (Middle Miocene), that resulted from the progressive propagation of NE-SW listric fault from the middle part of the grabens to the margins, and the large scale building up of roll-over structure. Further to the SW, the faults of the second extentional phase turn to NNE-SSW and ultimately N - S in the SW edge of the basin. Most of the fault systems were inactive by Upper Miocene except for the N - S fault system which is still active until recent time. © IJOG - 2016.","Nam Con Son Basin; Seismic; Tectonic evolution",,"Tuan, N.Q.; Exploration and Production Centre, Vietnam Petroleum InstituteViet Nam; email: tuannq@vpi.pvn.vn",,"Geological Agency",23559314,,,,"English","Indones.

Although petrographic analysis of particulate pellets is employed widely, it is both time consuming and does not allow variation within sampling units to be assessed - an important measure in any study whether it be for paleoenvironmental reconstruction or in obtaining estimates of industrial attributes. Also, samples taken as intact blocks provide additional information, such as texture and botanical affinity that cannot be gained using particulate pellets. Analysis of variance tests (ANOVA) on stratified samples from an Eocene coal bed in Kalimantan, Indonesia showed that the largest amount of microscopic variation occurs between coal types indicating they are petrographically dissimilar. The ANOVA tests also indicated that only a maximum of 125 point counts are needed to make precise estimates of block composition. Confidence limits of estimates from stratified sampling were calculated to be comparable to what would have been obtained using standard crushed particulate pellets. This means less work is needed for the same accuracy of estimates using a stratified sampling method over that of crushed particulate pellets for coal beds. Macroscopic point counting of vitrain bands can accurately account for those particles > 1 mm within a coal interval. This point counting method is conducted using something as simple as string on a coal face with marked intervals greater than the largest particle expected to be encountered (although new technologies are being developed to capture this type of information digitally). Comparative analyses of particulate pellets and blocks on the same interval show less than 6% variation between the two sample types when blocks are recalculated to include macroscopic counts of vitrain. Therefore even in coarse-grained coals, stratified sampling can be used effectively and representatively. © IJOG - 2016.","Analysis of variance; Coal type; Fine- and coarse-grained coals; Stratified sampling",,"Moore, T.A.; Cipher Consulting Ltd., 6 Stardust Street, Australia; email: tmoore@ciphercoal.com",,"Geological Agency",23559314,,,,"English","Indones.

This research is located at the Selayar limestone of Bulukumba Regency, South Sulawesi. The objective of this research is to define paleoclimate change based on the coral development and sea level fluctuation. Sample collection was done by applying five intersect lines perpendicular to the cliff. Petrographic analyses of fossils, and microfacies study as well as the sea level fluctuation were analyzed by studying organism, reef development, and morphology. This article is focused on the sea level fluctuation analysis. There are three stages of the reef development and sea level fluctuation. It was initiated within a protected shallow marine to a reef front slope unconformably overlying siliciclastic rock. The second period of the reef development is characterized by the growing of branching, delicate, robust, and massive corals associating giant Tridacna sp. The third period is the formation of bafflestone delicate branching coral and robust branching corals. Following the Pleistocene reef development three beach abrasions (notches) were identified indicating the sea level fluctuation. Beach abrasions occurred during the Pleistocene reef development as the first notch. The second notch occurred at the reef crest and back reef during the first sea level fall and finally the recent sea level as the third notch. © IJOG - 2016.","Pleistocene; Reef development; Sea level fluctuation; Selayar limestone",,"Imran, A.M.; Department of Geological Engineering, Hasanuddin University, Jln.

REE can occur in igneous and sedimentary rocks in significant amounts as primary deposits, whereas the secondary REE deposit can be produced by intensive lateritic weathering of bedrocks under the tropical or subtropical climate. Lateritic process can increase REE concentration from sub-economic levels in host rocks to be more valuable. Muncung Granite is located in a tropical area of Lingga Regency, Riau Islands Province. REE occurs in the Muncung Granite and in weathered layers (saprolite, laterite, and soil). ICP-MS was applied to measure the REE content in all samples of this study. The average REE content of the Muncung Granite is 265 ppm with Eu anomaly in REE's spider diagrams. Lateritization process has increased REE content by more than four times compared to that in the Muncung Granite. Ce and Eu anomalies in weathered layers can be associated with weathering process and initial REE contents in the host rock.

The tectonic setting and origin of these high-K rocks have been the subject of considerable debates. The Adang Volcanics have mafic to mafitic-intermediate characteristics (SiO2: 46 - 56 wt%) and a wide range of high alkaline contents (K2O: 0.80 - 9.08 %; Na2O: 0.90 - 7.21 %) with the Total Alkali of 6.67 - 12.60 %.

These ignimbrites have a similar compositions, raising the question of whether they are geneticaly related. The Batur Ignimbrite-1 (BI-1) is crystal poor, containing rhyodacitic (68 - 70wt % SiO2), white to grey pumices and partly welded and unwelded. The overlying Batur Ignimbrite-2 (BI-2) is a homogeneous grey to black dacitic pumices (64 - 66 wt % SiO2), unwelded and densely welded (40 - 60% vesicularity), crystal and lithic rich. Phase equilibria indicate that the Batur magma equilibrated at temperatures of 1100 - 1300°C with melt water contents of 3 - 6 wt%. The post-eruptive Batur magma was cooler ( &lt; 1100°C) and it is melt more water rich ( &gt; 6 wt % H2O). A pressure of 20 kbar is infered from mineral barometry for the Batur magma chamber. Magmatic chamber model is one in which crystals and melt separate from a convecting Batur magma by density differences, resulting in a stratified magma chamber with a homogeneous central zone, a crystal-rich accumulation zone near the walls or base, and a buoyant, melt-rich zone near the top. This is consistent with the estimated magma temperatures and densities: the pre-eruptive BI-1 magma was hoter (1300°C) and more volatile rich (6 wt % H2O) with density 2.25 g/cm3 than the BI-2 magma (1200°C; 4 wt % H2O) in density was higher (2.50 g/cm3). Batur melt characteristics and intensive parameters are consistent with a volatile oversaturation-driven eruption. However, the higher H2O content, high viscosity and low crystal content of the BI-1 magma imply an external eruption trigger.","Batur caldera; Dacite; Ignimbrite; Magma chamber model; Melting zone; Rhyodacite",,"Sutawidjaja, I.S.; Geological Agency of IndonesiaIndonesia; email: iganss12@gmail.com",,"Geological Agency",23559314,,,,"English","Indones.

The ore deposit is hosted within the carbonate rocks of the Permian to Carboniferous Tapanuli Group. It is mainly accumulated in hollows replacing limestone in the forms of lensoidal, colloform, veins, veinlets, cavity filling, breccia, and dissemination. The ores dominantly consist of galena (126 000 ppm Pb) and sphalerite (2347 ppm Zn). The other minerals are silver, azurite, covellite, pyrite, marcasite, and chalcopyrite. This deposit was formed by at least three phases of mineralization, i.e. pyrite and then galena replaced pyrite, sphalerite replaced galena, and pyrite. The last phase is the deposition of chalcopyrite that replaced sphalerite. The Latong sulfide ore deposits posses Pb isotope ratio of 206Pb/204Pb = 19.16 - 20.72, 207Pb/204Pb = 16.16 - 17.29, and 208Pb/204Pb = 42.92 - 40.78.

This leads to an interpretation that the Latong deposit belongs to the Sedimentary Hosted Massive Sulfide (SHMS) of Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT). The presence of SHMS in the island arc such as Sumatra has become controversial. For a long time, ore deposits in the Indonesian Island Arc are always identical with the porphyry and hydrothermal processes related to arc magmatism. This paper is dealing with the geology of Latong and its base metal deposits. This work is also to interpret their genesis as well as general relationship to the regional geology and tectonic setting of Sumatra.","Base-metal; Galena; Kuantan formation; Latong; Mississippi valley type",,"Harahap, B.H.; Centre for Geological Survey, Geological Agency, Jln.

In this paper, the results of radon and thoron exhalation rate measurements from surface soil of Bangka Belitung Islands at thirty six measurement sites are presented. Exhalation rates of radon and thoron were measured by using an accumulation chamber equipped with a solid-state alpha particle detector. Furthermore, the correlations between radon and thoron exhalation rates with their parent nuclide (226Ra and 232Th) concentrations in collected soil samples from the same locations were also evaluated. The result of the measurement shows that mostly the distribution of radon and thoron is similar to 226Ra and 232Th, eventhough it was not a good correlation between radon and thoron exhalation rate with their parent activity concentrations (226Ra and 232Th) due to the environmental factors that can influence the radon and thoron mobilities in the soil.

An earlier research concluded that the black clay of the Baturetno Formation formed as a 'palaeolake' deposit. The 'palaeolake' was interpreted to form due to the shifting course of the Bengawan Solo Purba River in relation to Pliocene tectonic tilting in the southern Java. The stratigraphy of the Baturetno Formation was observed in the western part of the Baturetno Basin, and based on marker beds, the Baturetno Formation was classified into three units: (1) Gravel unit (GR) in the upper part, (2) clay unit (CU) in the middle part, and (3) sand-gravel unit (SG) in the lower part. There are floating gravel fragments of andesite, claystone, coral, and limestone with diameters of up to 10 cm in the clay unit. The particle size of sediment reflects the environment, but the lake deposition occurs under very quiet conditions. The occurrence of these fragments within the clay cannot be explained if the clay was deposited within a lake environment. The occurrence of floating fragments in the black clay of Baturetno Formation can best be explained through mudflow process. The cohesive strength of the mudflow is responsible for the ability of large fragments to float within the mud matrix. In general, the Baturetno Formation is inferred to be an alluvial fan deposit. The presence of sand, gravel, and mud are characteristics of alluvial fan deposits.","Alluvial fan; Baturetno Formation; Black clay deposits; Mud flow deposit",,"Putra, P.S.; Research Center for Geotechnology, LIPI Kompleks LIPI, Gd 70, Jln.

In order to understand the characteristics of the landslide mechanism, a field survey was conducted in 2013 which sampled both the origin soil and landslide material, and the water from hotspring around the landslide site. The physical properties of the soil obtained show that the original soil has dominantly coarser grain than the landslide material (80.5% coarser grain compared to 11.8% coarse grain respectively) which indicates that the soil has become finer and softer. Hot spring analysis indicated that the mineral content of the water was 99.48% SO4. This shows that magmatism processes are involved which caused the soil to become acidic and may have fragilised the system. Results of X-ray Diffraction Mineralogy Analysis (XRD) show that the original soil is composed of minerals of cristobalite, quartz, and albite, while the landslide material consists of clay minerals such as quartz, saponite, chabazite, silicon oxide, and coesite which are typical minerals in a hydrothermal environment. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the area was influenced by an active geothermal system that could be the main source mechanism behind this disastrous event.","Clay minerals; Geothermal system; Landslide; Lembata Island; Sample analysis",,"Yudhicara; Centre for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Geological Agency, Jln.

Eight varieties of metamorphic rocks samples from this location, which are garnet-bearing epidote-barroisite schist, epidote-barroisite schist, glaucophane-quartz schist, garnet-muscovite schist, actinolite-talc schist, epidote schist, muscovite schist, and serpentinite, were investigated in detail its petrological and mineralogical characteristics by using polarization microscope and electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA). Furthermore, the pressure-temperature path of garnet-bearing epidote-barroisite schist was estimated by using mineral parageneses, reaction textures, and mineral chemistries to assess the metamorphic history. The primary stage of this rock might be represented by the assemblage of glaucophane + epidote + titanite ± paragonite. The assemblage yields 1.7 - 1.0 GPa in assumed temperature of 300 - 550 °C, which is interpreted as maximum pressure limit of prograde stage. The peak P-T condition estimated on the basis of the equilibrium of garnet rim, barroisite, phengite, epidote, and quartz, yields 547 - 690 °C and 1.1 - 1.5 GPa on the albite epidote amphibolite-facies that correspond to the depth of 38 - 50 km. The retrograde stage was presented by changing mineral compositions of amphiboles from the Si-rich barroisite to the actinolite, which lies near 0.5 GPa at 350 °C. It could be concluded that metamorphic rocks from the Meratus Complex experienced low-temperature and high-pressure conditions (blueschist-facies) prior to the peak metamorphism of the epidote amphibolite-facies. The subduction environments in Meratus Complex during Cretaceous should be responsible for this metamorphic condition.","Garnet-bearing epidote-barroisite schist; High-pressure metamorphic rocks; Meratus complex; Pressure-temperature path; South Kalimantan",,"Setiawan, N.I.; Geological Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Gadjah MadaIndonesia; email: nugroho.setiawan@ugm.ac.id",,"Geological Agency",23559314,,,,"English","Indones.

Limestone of the Upper Cibulakan Formation was deposited locally and discontinuously, whilst the Parigi Formation limestone was deposited evenly and continuously.

The study involves eight samples taken from a 56 m long drill core of Sangkarewang oil shale. Geochemical investigation showed that the samples consist of varied terrigenous input represented by Si, Al, K, and Ti, and autochthonous input represented by S, total organic carbon (TOC), and δ13C of bulk organic matter. Along the drill core profile the abundance of autochthonous input decreases upwards, while that of terrigenous input oppositely increases upwards. Petrographical analysis revealed that calcite is a major mineral in the samples. In this study, the abundance of calcite could be represented by the abundance of Ca, as calcite is the only significant Ca containing mineral. Ca is abundant in the samples (8.4% in average) and its concentration varies similarly with those of S, TOC, and δ13C, suggesting that the element as well as calcite incorporates the autochthonous input. The variation of calcite abundance in the drill core profile is considered to be related with primary productivity changes during the development of the former lake. Higher primary productivity represented by more positive of δ13C value (-24.8‰) during the deposition of the lower part of the drill core profile promoted the higher amount of deposited organic matter. In such environment, the supersaturation of carbonate ion in lake water was also reached and significant precipitation of authigenic calcite occurred. As the lake developed, the primary productivity decreased as indicated by more negative of δ13C value (eventually -26.8‰). This condition led to the decreases of deposited organic matter and calcite in the lake sediments.","Calcite precipitation; Depositional environment; Oil shale; Ombilin Basin; Primary productivity",,"Widayat, A.H.; Research Group of Earth Resources Exploration, Faculty of Mining and Petroleum Engineering, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Jln.

Sandbox experiment is one of the types of analogue modeling in geological sciences in which the main purpose is simulating deformation style and structural evolution of the sedimentary basin. Sandbox modeling is one of the effective ways in conducting physically modeling and evaluates complex deformation of sedimentary rocks. The main purpose of this paper is to evaluate structural geometry and deformation history of oblique convergent deformation using of integrated technique of analogue sandbox modeling applying to deformation of Seram Fold-Thrust-Belt (SFTB) in the Seram Island, Eastern Indonesia. Oblique convergent strike-slip deformation has notoriously generated area with structural complex geometry and pattern resulted from role of various local parameters that control stress distributions.

The result of four case (Case 1 to 4) modeling setting indicated that two of modeling variables clearly affected in our sandbox modeling results; these are lithological variation (mainly stratigraphy of Seram Island) and pre-existing basement fault geometry (basement configuration). Lithological variation was mainly affected in the total number of faults development. On the other hand, pre-existing basement fault geometry was highly influenced in the end results particularly fault style and pattern as demonstrated in Case 4 modeling. In addition, this study concluded that deformation in the Seram Island is clearly best described using oblique convergent strike-slip (transpression) stress system.","Fold-thrust-belt; Oblique convergent; Sandbox modeling; Strike-slip",,"Sapiie, B.; Geological Engineering Study Program, Faculty of Earth Sciences and Technology, ITB, Jln.

Ore and alteration mineral assemblage, fluid inclusions, and radiogenic isotope studies were undertaken in some deposits in western Java combined with literature studies from previous authors. Ore mineralogy of some deposits from western Java such as Pongkor, Cibaliung, Cikidang, Cisungsang, Cirotan, Arinem, and Cineam shows slightly different characteristics as those are divided into Se- and Te-types deposits. The ore mineralogy of the westernmost of west Java region such as Pongkor, Cibaliung, Cikidang, Cisungsang, and Cirotan is characterized by the dominance of silver-arsenic-antimony sulfosalt with silver selenides and rarely tellurides over the argentite, while to the eastern part of West Java such as Arinem and Cineam deposits are dominated by silver-gold tellurides. The average formation temperatures measured from fluid inclusions of quartz associated with ore are in the range of 170 - 220°C with average salinity of less than 1 wt% NaClequiv. for Se-type and 190 - 270°C with average salinity of ~2 wt% NaClequiv. for Te-type.","Epithermal gold-silver deposit; Fluid inclusions; Se-type; Selenides; Te-type; Tellurides; Western",,"Yuningsih, E.T.; Faculty of Geology, Padjadjaran University, Jln.

The Talawi and Lubuktaruk regions situated within intra-montane Ombilin Basin, and the Kiliranjao area assumed to be located in a small intra montane Kiliranjao Sub-basin are occupied by Eo-Oligocene sediments of Sangkarewang and Kiliran Formations, respectively. Field activity, geochemical screening techniques, and organic petrographic analysis, supported by SEM mode, are methods used. Most of the oil shale sequence is typically of an organically rich-succession comprising predominantly well-bedded, laminated and fissile, brownish to dark grey organic-rich shales and mudstones. The exinite macerals within oil shale comprise mainly Pediastrum-lamalginite with minor cutinite, resinite, liptodetrinite, sporinite, bituminite, and rare Botryococcus-telalginite. Therefore, the oil shale deposits can be described as ""lamosites"". Minor vitrinite maceral is also recognized. TOC analysis on selected shale samples corresponds to a fair up to excellent category of source rock characterization. The kerogen is suggested to be of mixed Type II and Type I autochthonous materials such as alginite, with minor allochthonous substances. Oil samples collected appear to be positioned within more oil prone rather than gas prone. Thermal maturity of the oil shales tends to show an immature to marginally/early mature stage. By evaluating all the results of geochemical and organic petrological analyses conducted on shale lithologies (shale and mudstone), it can be concluded that the oil shales in those areas are effective source rocks having a favourable potential for generating shale oil or gas to be included as alternative energy resources in the future.","Alternative energy; Effective source rock; Lamosite; Oil or gas; Oil shale",,"Winantris; Faculty of Geology, Padjadjaran University, Jln.

To develop the field, a proper geological model which can be used in reservoir simulation was needed. This model has to represent the complexity of the rock type and the variety of oil types among the clusters. Creating this model was challenging due to the heterogeneity of the Baturaja Formation (BRF): Early Miocene reef, carbonate platform, and breccia conglomerate grew up above the basement with a variety of thickness and quality distributions. The reservoir thickness varies between 23 - 600 ft and 3D seismic frequency ranges from 1 - 80 Hz with 25 Hz dominant frequency. Structurally, the Fika Field has a high basement slope, which has an impact on the flow unit layering slope. Based on production data, each area shows different characteristics and performance: some areas have high water cut and low cumulative production. Oil properties several clusters also vary in wax content. The wax content can potentially build up a deposit inside tubing and flow-line, resulted in a possible disturbance to the operation. Five well cores were analyzed, including thin section and XRD. Seven check-shot data and 3D seismic Pre-Stack Time Migration (PSTM) were available with limited seismic resolution. A seismic analysis was done after well seismic tie was completed. This analysis included paleogeography, depth structure map, and distribution of reservoir and basement. Core and log data generated facies carbonate distribution and rock typing, defining properties for log analysis and permeability prediction for each zone. An Sw prediction for each well was created by J-function analysis. This elaborates capillary pressure from core data, so it is very similar to the real conditions. Different stages of the initial model were done i.e. scale-up properties, data analysis, variogram modeling, and then the properties were distributed using the geostatistic method. Finally, after G & G collaborated with petrophysicists and reservoir engineers to complete their integrated analysis, a geological model was finally created. After that, material balance was needed to confirm reserve calculations. The result of OOIP (Original Oil in Place) and OGIP (Original Gas in Place) were confirmed, because it was similar to the production data and reservoir pressure. The model was then ready to be used in reservoir simulation.","Carbonate; Fika Field; Reservoir modeling; Rock and oil types; Simulation",,"Adji, E.F.; PT Medco E and P IndonesiaIndonesia; email: era_206@yahoo.com",,"Geological Agency",23559314,,,,"English","Indones.

Since then a strong tectonic activity in Sundaland has been restricted to existing regional fault zones and to regional slow, vertical crustal movements elsewhere that produced small to very large sedimentary basins. On the other hand, regional deformation of Indosinia as a consequence of ductile shearing has continued into the Paleogene. Since the Oligocene, the northern part of Sundaland and Indosinia have been extruded differentially towards southeast along the Red River, Wang Chao (or Mae Ping, or Tonle Sap), and Three Pagodas - Axial Malay fault zones. The initial cause has been attributed to hard collision between Subplate India with Megaplate Eurasia. Plate dynamics in the region have changed substantially since Mid-Miocene as to force wrench-slip reversals along the major fault zones in Sundaland as well as in Indosinia. Concomitant structural inversions are demonstrated on seismic sections. In the core of Sundaland, earlier transtensional wrenching was succeeded by transpressive strike-slip faulting that on major faults of the Malay Basin manifested in reversals of sense. From the Hinge-line fault eastward, the transtensional left wrench slip was succeeded by transpressional dextral slip, while in the region to its west the wrench-slip kinematics was an earlier transtensional right slip followed by transpressional left slip. In the Strait of Malacca and eastern margin of Sumatra, right-lateral wrenching in the Neogene has been common. In certain places it could be established a wrench-slip of transtensional character in Oligocene-Early Miocene, and the transpressional wrench movement occurred mainly during the Middle to Late Miocene. The remarkable coincidence of termination of spreading of the South China Basin in Langhian, and that of the West Philippine and Caroline basins during Mid Miocene invites further study.","Domains delineation; Sequence; Transtensional vs. tranpressional wrenching",,"Tjia, H.D.; Institute for Environment and Development, University Kebangsaan Malaysia, UKMMalaysia; email: tjiahd@gmail.com",,"Geological Agency",23559314,,,,"English","Indones.

Generally, lithotype variation in the bottom part of the coal seams has a lower frequency than in the upper part. Petrographical analysis was performed to determine the maceral composition, groundwater index (GWI), and gelification index (GI). The samples from lower sections show much higher GWI-GI values and lower variation frequency than from the upper section. This characteristic is interpreted as the result of development of mesotrophic to ombrotrophic peats during the deposition of lower to upper parts of the section, respectively. During the development of the mesotrophic peat, water was more abundant and relatively stable in budget. However, during the development of ombrotrophic peat, water was less abundant and relatively not stable in budget. The latter is related to the water supply depending only on rain, resulted in the more sensitive water table in the ombrotrophic peat. The unstable water table is thought as the reason of higher variation frequency of lithotype, GWI, GI, as well as maceral composition in the upper part of the core. Unstable water table would lead to moist condition in the uppermost layer of the ombrotrophic peat, favoring fungi to grow. This is confirmed by the higher abundance of sclerotinite maceral in samples from the upper part of the coal core.","Coal seam facies; Kutai Basin; Muara Wahau",,"Widayat, A.H.; Research Group of Earth Resource Exploration, Faculty of Mining and Petroleum Engineering, ITB, Jln.

Based on TOC versus Pyrolysis Yields (PY) diagram, the shales of Sinamar Formation are included into oil prone source rock potential with good to excellent categories. Fine sediments of the Sinamar Formation tend to produce oil and gas originated from kerogen types I and III. The shales tend to generate oil than claystone and mudstone and therefore they are included into a potential source rock.","Biomarker; Oligocene; Organic petrography; Shale; Sinamar Formation",,"Zajuli, M.H.H.; Center for Geological Survey, Geological Agency, Jln.

Four types of the limestones are identified such as wackestone, packstone, grainstone, and floatstone. At least five microfacies form the limestone succesion of the Baturaja Formation. They are interpreted as sedimentary facies of very restricted bay and pond, back reef local slope, slope and shelf edge, winnowed platform edge sand, and reef flank facies.","Baturaja; Limestone; Microfacies; Petrography; Sedimentary facies",,"Maryanto, S.; Centre for Geological Survey, Geological Agency, Jln.

Currently, about 105,000 artisanal and small-scale gold miners (AS are operating in two main localities, i.e.Gogorea and Gunung Botak by digging pits/shafts following gold-be quartz vein orientation. The gold extraction uses mercury (amalgamation) and cyanide processing. The field s identifies two types/generations of quartz veins namely (1) Early quartz veins which are segmented, sigmoidal continous, and parallel to the foliation of host rock. The quartz vein is lack of sulfides, weak mineralized, crysta relatively clear, and maybe poor in gold, and (2) Quartz veins occurred within a 'mineralized zone' of about 1 in width and ~1,000 m in length. The gold mineralization is strongly overprinted by an argillic alteration zone mineralization-alteration zone is probably parallel to the mica schist foliation and strongly controlled by N-S or SW-trending structures. The gold-bearing quartz veins are characterized by banded texture particularly collo following host rock foliation and sulphide banding, brecciated, and rare bladed-like texture. The alteration t consist of propylitic (chlorite, calcite, sericite), argillic, and carbonation represented by graphite banding and ca flakes. The ore mineralization is characterized by pyrite, native gold, pyrrhotite, and arsenopyrite. Cinnabar, stib chalcopyrite, galena, and sphalerite are rare or maybe absent. In general, sulphide minerals are rare (&lt; 3%). Fifteen samples were collected in Wamsaid area for geochemical assaying for Au, Ag, As, Sb, Hg, Cu, Pb, and Zn. Elev fifteen samples yielded more than 1.00 g/t Au, in which six of them are in excess of 3.00 g/t Au. It can be noted all high-grade samples are originally or containing limonitic materials, that suggest the role of supergene enrichm Interestingly, most of the high-grade samples contain also high grade As (up to 991ppm), Sb (up to 885 ppm), an (up to 75 ppm). Fluid inclusions in both quartz vein types consist of four phases including L-rich, V-rich, L-V and L1-L2-V (CO2)-rich phases. Mineralizing hydrothermal fluid is typified by CO2 -rich fluid, moderate temper of 300 - 400°C and a typical low salinity (0.36 to 0.54 wt.% NaCl eq). Based on those key features, gold minera tion in Buru Island meets the characteristics of LS epithermal or orogenic gold deposit types; however, it tends fitter with orogenic gold deposit rather than another type.","Buru Island; Gold mineralization; Indonesia; Metamorphic rock",,"Idrus, A.; Geological Engineering Department, Gadjah Mada UniversityIndonesia; email: arifidrus@ugm.ac.id",,"Geological Agency",23559314,,,,"English","Indones.

This technology must be simple, cheap, easy to operate, and financially rewarding. A proven option that should be promoted is phytoextraction, a farming activity that could develop agriculture as an alternative livelihood in ASGM areas. This isa technology where plants are used to extract metals from waste rock, soil, or water. These metals can be recovered from the plant in its pure form, then be sold or recycled. Gold phytoextrac tion is a commercially available technology, whilean international research has shown that phytoextraction will also work for mercury. In the context of this idea, tailings would be contained in 'farming areas' and cropped using phytoextraction technology. Gold and mercury would be extracted in the crops, with the remaining mercury burden of the tailings becoming adsorbed to soil constituents. The system would be financially rewarding to 'gold farmers'. The economic value of this scenario could facilitate the clean-up and management of mercury pollution, reducing the movement of mercury from tailings into soil, water, and plants, thereby mitigating environmental and human risk in the mining areas. The goal of the described research is to promote agriculture as an alterna tive livelihood in ASGM areas. The gold value of the phytoremediation crop should provide a cash incentive to artisanal farmers who develop this new agricultural enterprise. The benefits will be social, environmental, and economic, as opportunities for education, employment, new business, the containment of toxic mercury, food safety and security, and revenue are all realized.","Agriculture; Gold; New business; Phytomining; Phytoremediation; Tailing",,"Krisnayanti, B.D.; University of Mataram, International Research Centre for Management of Degraded and Mining Lands (IRC-MEDMIND)Indonesia; email: bqdewi@yahoo.com",,"Geological Agency",23559314,,,,"English","Indones.
