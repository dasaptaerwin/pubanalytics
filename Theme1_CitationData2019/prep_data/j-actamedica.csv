The lesions of atherosclerosis represent a series of highly specific cellular and molecular responses. The earliest changes that precede the formation of lesions of atherosclerosis take place in the endothelium (EC), with resultant endothelial dysfunction. The EC-induced injury can result in increased lipid permeability, macrophage recruitment, formation of foam cells, and recruitment of T-lymphocytes and platelet. After intimal injury, different cell types,including ECs, platelets, and inflammatory cells release mediators, such as growth factors and cytokines that induce multiple effects including phenotype change of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from the quiescent ""contractile"" phenotype state to the active ""synthetic"" state, that can migrate and proliferate from media to the intima. The inflammatory response simulates migration and proliferation of VSMC that become intermixed with the area of inflammation to form an intermediate lesion. These responses continue uninhibited and is accompanied by accumulation of new extra cellular matrix (ECM). The migratory and proliferative activities of VSMC are regulated by growth promoters such as platelet derived growth factors (PGF), endothelin-1 (ET-1), thrombin, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and inhibitors such as, heparin sulfates , nitric oxide (NO), transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. The matrix metallo proteinases (MMPs) could also participate in the process of VSMC migration. MMPs could catalyze and remove the basement membrane around VSMC and facilitate contacts with the interstitial matrix. This could promote a change from quiescent, contractile VSMC to cells capable of migrating and proliferating to mediate repair. The VSMC regulation is a very complex process, VSMC are stimulated to proliferate and migrate by some kind of cytokines, growth factors, angiotensin II (Ang-II). Together with apoptosis, proliferation and migration of VSMC are vital to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and plaque rupture. Rupture of the plaque is associated with increased fibrous cap macrophage, increased VSMC apoptosis, and reduced fibrous cap VSMC. VSMC are the only cells with plaques capable of synthesizing structurally important collagen isoforms, and the apoptosis of VSMC might promote plaque rupture.",,"apoptosis; arteriosclerosis; cardiovascular function; cardiovascular system; endothelium; human; inflammation; pathophysiology; physiology; review; vascular smooth muscle; Apoptosis; Arteriosclerosis; Cardiovascular Physiology; Cardiovascular System; Endothelium; Humans; Inflammation; Muscle, Smooth, Vascular","Rudijanto, A.",,,01259326,,,17933075,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38449095878

METHODS: this study were conducted at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital (RSUPN-CM), Persahabatan Hospital, MMC Hospital and Medistra Hospital, Jakarta. The study started from 1 May 2005 to 5 May 2006. Study Design was an interventional study which was a randomized double blind controlled trial to evaluate the effects of curcumin administration at escalating doses (low dose 3 times 15 mg/day, moderate dose 3 times 30 mg/day, and high dose 3 times 60 mg/day) on total cholesterol level, LDL cholesterol level, HDL cholesterol level, and triglyceride level in ACS patients. RESULTS: a 75 ACS patients undergoing randomization participated in randomized controlled trial (RCT). Of the 75 ACS patients participating in that RCT, 67 received care at RSCM, 6 at Persahabatan Hospital, and 2 at MMC Hospital. As many as 63 patients were able to participate in the RCT up to its conclusion. There was no significant difference in age, sex, risk factor of dyslipidemia, DM, smoking, hypertension, CHD history in family, height, body weight and body mass index, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure in the four groups of patients. This showed that the randomization performed was reasonably good. There was no significant difference in laboratory parameters, such as total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride, fasting blood glucose, blood glucose 2 hours PP, glyco Hb, triglyceride, Hb, Ht, leukocyte, thrombocyte, ureum, creatinine, SGOT, SGPT, in the four groups. There was no significant difference in types of ACS and locations of ACS in the four groups as well. There was no significant difference in statin medicatios (simvastatin), aspirin ACE inhibitor, and DM medications in the four groups. No patient used tiazolidindion. No significant difference was found in the percentage of compliance in the four groups of patients. The effects of curcumin on total cholesterol level and LDL cholesterol level, there was a trend that the lower the dose of curcumin, the higher the effect of reduction. For HDL cholesterol level, there was also a trend that the lower the dose of curcumin, the higher the effect of increase in HDL cholesterol level. However, for triglyceride the pattern was not the same, and the group of moderate-dose curcumin shoed the minimal effect of increase, followed by the low-dose curcumin and finally the high-dose curcumin that showed the highest effect of increase.

It is characterized by relative or absolute deficiency of insulin secretion and/or insulin resistance that causes chronic hyperglycemia and impaired carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins metabolism. Diabetes has been known as an oxidative stress disorder caused by imbalance between free radical formation and the ability of the body's natural antioxidants. Many studies have suggested that oxidative stress play a role in systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, impaired secretion of pancreatic cells and impaired glucose utilization in peripheral tissues. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are at risk, intensive intervention with multiple drug combinations and lifestyle modifications showed a beneficial effect on vascular complications and reduce mortality rate due to cardiovascular disease and other causes. There has also been shown that neutralization of reactive molecules can significantly inhibit the development of endothelial dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy in patients with DM. Recently the use of antioxidants still remains a controversy, but its use as a therapy for DM can be considered because its demonstrated effectiveness in lowering the risk of developing diabetes and its complications. Various antioxidants have been developed for oxidative stress treatment in DM, including the use of vitamins and supplements as well as the use of some components of plants and fresh fruits which have demonstrated antioxidant effect in DM patients.

From the mechanistic view, nutritional factors are classified into genotoxic and non-genotoxic agents. Genotoxic agent begins their action at the DNA level, causing DNA damage through several mechanisms, e.g. gene point mutations, deletions and insertions, recombinations, rearrangements and amplifications, as well as chromosomal aberrations. Most genotoxic agents are micro components of nutrition, i.e. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) or heterocyclic amines (HCAs), aflatoxin, and N-nitrosamine. Non-genotoxic agents are less defined in their modes of action, but they are presumed to indirectly affect the cell through tumor promoters. These agents are generally macro components, e.g. high fat. Moreover, epigenetic factors, including changes in the DNA methylation pattern, and peroxidation process resulting reactive oxygen species (ROS), are also known to cause cancer. On the other hand, it is also well recognized that diet and nutrition contain components that can reduce the risk of cancer, in some cases by decreasing the effects of food mutagens, or through carcinogen detoxification, or protection of DNA from electrophilic carcinogen. Thus nutritionally related cancer ultimately develops from an imbalance of carcinogenesis and anti-carcinogenesis process.",,"aflatoxin B1; alcohol; carcinogen; heterocyclic compound; mutagenic agent; nitrosamine; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; chemically induced disorder; chromosome aberration; diet; genetics; human; neoplasm; review; risk factor; Aflatoxin B1; Carcinogens, Environmental; Chromosome Aberrations; Diet; Ethanol; Heterocyclic Compounds; Humans; Mutagens; Neoplasms; Nitrosamines; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Risk Factors","Sutandyo, N.email: levinapakasi@cbn.net.id",,,01259326,,,20305331,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957283864

Inflammation suggests influence a balance between prostate cell growth and apoptosis by increasing microenvironment around prostate factors such as cytokines, COX-2 and oxidative stress. These factors stimulate proliferation and minimize cell apoptosis. In vitro studies showed an over expression of these inflammatory markers in BPH and PC compared normal tissue. There were also inflammatory marker differences between BPH and PC, which was more severe inflammation process in PC. Another basic difference was a gene polymorphism in PC. Targeting the microenvironment may represent a promising therapeutic approach for prostate disease.

METHODS: A national sample involving 24,417 participants living in urban Indonesia aged > 15 years were examined for 2 hours of plasma glucose concentrations in a cross sectional survey using the 75-g oral glucose. Diagnostic criteria of the World Health Organization 1999 and American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2003 were used to determine the prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance. Data on age, smoking, physical activity were obtained from the personal interview, and obesity included body mass index and waist circumference and blood pressure were measured. RESULTS: The prevalences of diabetes in urban Indonesia was 5.7%, consisting of diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DDM) 1.5%, undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (UDDM) 4.2% and IGT 10.2%. The prevalence of DM was 6.4% in women and 4.9% in men. In the youngest group (15-24 years) 5.3% had IGT. Prevalence increases with age with a sharp rise from middle age (35-54 years). Determinant factors for IGT and diabetes were age, smoking, obesity, central obesity and hypertension.

This condition may be caused by dysfunction of appetite-regulating pathways and energy balance due to leptin resistance. Leptin, a 16 kDa hormone, is the most important regulator of appetite and energy balance in the body. Most individuals with obesity have leptin resistance characterized by increased leptin blood levels. Some possibilities of mechanism involved in leptin resistance have been proposed by researchers despite the fact that it is still being studied hitherto. One of the mechanisms considered to have a role in leptin resistance is disruption in signal transduction process through Janus-activating kinase2-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2-STAT3) pathway on leptin receptors by suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3). SOCS-3 is a protein that inhibits the signal transduction process of various cytokines in the body, including leptin. SOCS-3 expression is induced by leptin and SOCS-3 activation will inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation which is important in signal transmission on leptin receptors. Such inhibition will consequently cause leptin resistance characterized by dysfunction of leptin biological function.",,"cytokine; leptin; leptin receptor; SOCS3 protein, human; suppressor of cytokine signaling; unclassified drug; biosynthesis; blood; energy metabolism; genetics; human; metabolism; obesity; review; risk factor; signal transduction; Cytokines; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Leptin; Obesity; Receptors, Leptin; Risk Factors; Signal Transduction; Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins","Lubis, A.R.email: adi.fkui@gmail.com",,,01259326,,,18560028,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-59849086607

The mouth is subjected to a wide spectrum of antigenic agents, including foodstuff, and allergic reactions to such antigens may manifest in a number of diverse ways. Food allergy, however, has not been widely investigated as the cause of RAS. The main complaint of RAS typically is pain, and the main therapy is still corticosteroids, besides avoiding allergenic foodstuff. In RAS, there is often a genetic basis. More than 42 percent of patients with RAS have first-degree relatives with RAS. The likelihood of RAS is 90 percent when both parents are affected, but only 20 percent when neither parent has RAS, and it is also likely to be more severe and to start at an earlier age in patients with a positive family history. The primary goals of therapy of RAS are relief of pain, reduction of ulcer duration, and restoration of normal oral function. The secondary goals include reduction in frequency and severity of recurrences and maintenance of remission. Diagnostic elimination diets are frequently utilized both in diagnosis and management of RAS caused by food allergy. Patients with RAS may have increased levels of CD8+ T-lymphocytes and/or decreased CD4+ T-lymphocytes. There may be a reduced percentage of ""virgin"" T-cells and an increased of ""memory"" T-lymphocytes. Patients with active RAS have an increased proportion of gd T-cells compared with healthy control subjects and RAS patients with inactive disease. The gd T-cells may play a role in ADCC and it is believed that gd T-cells play a role in immunological damages.

METHODS: We postulate that green tea polyphenols regulate TNF-alpha gene expression by modulating NF-KB activation through their inhibition effect on IKB Kinase (IKK) activity and as scavenger of free radicals. Pretreatment of green tea polyphenols reduced oxLDL-induced production of proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and NF-KB activation in dose dependent manner (p < 0.05).

The three PPARs (alpha, beta/delta, and gamma) are distributed differently in the different organs. PPARalpha is most common in the liver, but also found in kidney, gut, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, while PPARbeta/delta, is fairly ubiquitous; it may be found in body tissues and brain (for myelination process and lipid metabolism in the brain). PPARgamma has 3 isoforms, such as PPARgamma 1, PPARgamma 2, and PPARgamma 3. The syndrome-X was firstly coined by Reaven in 1988 and then to be provided in 1999 by the name : the metabolic syndrome-X. This metabolic syndrome represents a ""Cluster"" of metabolic disorders and cardiovascular risk factors which has been collected and summarized by the author and such a cluster includes: insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia, central obesity, glucose intolerance/DM, atherogenic dyslipidemia (increase TG, decrease HDL-cholesterol, increase Apo-B, increase small dense LDL), hypertension, prothrombotic state (increase PAI-1, increase F-VII, increase fibrinogen, increase vWF, increase adhesion molecules), endothelial dysfunction, hyperuricemia, and increased hsC-RP and cytokines. The metabolic syndrome-X may lead to the development of T2DM and coronary heart disease (CHD); insulin resistance plays pivotal roles in the progression of such a syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. Improvement of Insulin Resistance, therefore, is most likely to reduce the high cardiovascular event rate in T2DM. It has been generally accepted that Insulin Resistance (detected by HOMA-R) and Acute Insulin Response = AIR (by HOMA-B) are both usually present in T2DM. The Thiazolidinedions (TZDs) are Insulin Sensitizers (e.g Rosiglitazone = ROS, Pioglitazone = PIO) introduced into clinical practice in 1997; clinical evidence data showed that TZDs improved both HOMA-R, and HOMA-B. PPARgamma can be activated by TZDs and it appears to be fundamental to the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus i.e increase GLUT-4, increase glucokinase, decrease PEPCK, increase GLUT-4, and decreases production by fat cell of several mediators that may cause insulin resistance, such as TNFalpha and resistin. PPARgamma also mediates increased production of Adiponectin and the insulin signaling intermediate PI3K, and both actions lead to increase insulin sensitivity. A ""dual PPARgamma-PPARalpha agonists"" (e.g PIO, but ROS poorly activate PPARalpha) might lower glucose and modulate lipids. Thus, PIO, as a stronger ""dual PPARgamma-PPARalpha agonists"", shows an important therapeutic pathway in diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases, even in metabolic syndrome. Current evidence suggests a close relationship between activation of PPARgamma and restoration of insulin sensitivity by reductions in TNFalpha and FFAs, and the enhancement of insulin stimulation of PI3-K Pathway and also increase adiponectin & decrease resistin.",,"2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; antidiabetic agent; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; pioglitazone; rosiglitazone; drug potentiation; human; insulin resistance; metabolic syndrome X; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; physiology; review; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin Resistance; Metabolic Syndrome X; PPAR gamma; Thiazolidinediones","Tjokroprawiro, A.",,,01259326,,,17119268,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-39049183932

The pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in diabetes is multifactorial and can be affected by metabolic and other factors. A hypothesis for the initial lesion of atherosclerosis is endothelial dysfunction, defined pragmatically as changes in the concentration of the chemical messengers produced by the endothelial cell and/or by blunting of the nitric oxide-dependent vasodilatory response to acetylcholine or hyperemia. Endothelial dysfunction has been documented in patients with diabetes and in individuals with insulin resistance or at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes. The way endothelial function altered in diabetic patients is not yet fully understood, but the loss of normal endothelial function could be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic angiopathy, as endothelial dysfunction is associated with diabetic microangiopathy and macroangiopathy. Factors associated with endothelial dysfunction in diabetes include activation of protein kinase C, overexpression of growth factors and/or cytokines, and oxidative stress. Changes in endothelium function may lead to the coronary artery circulation being unable to cope with the increased metabolism of myocardial muscle independently of a reduced coronary artery diameter. Finally, recent reports indicate that an improved metabolic control in diabetic patients, whatever the treatment used, is associated with near normalization or restoration of normal endothelial function.",,"amylin; amyloid; angiotensin II; antilipemic agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; nitric oxide; blood; cardiovascular disease; comorbidity; diabetes mellitus; diabetic angiopathy; fibrinolysis; hemostasis; human; hyperglycemia; inflammation; insulin resistance; oxidative stress; pathophysiology; physiology; review; risk factor; vascular endothelium; Amyloid; Angiotensin II; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Antilipemic Agents; Cardiovascular Diseases; Comorbidity; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Angiopathies; Endothelium, Vascular; Fibrinolysis; Hemostasis; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Inflammation; Insulin Resistance; Nitric Oxide; Oxidative Stress; Risk Factors","Shahab, A.",,,01259326,,,16479030,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33748174662

Graves' disease is caused by stimulation of TSH receptor located on the thyroid gland by an antibody, which is known as TSH receptor antibody (TRAb). Furthermore, this may lead to hyperplasia and hyperfunction of the thyroid gland. On the contrary, the cause of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is thought due to a TSH stimulation-blocking antibody (TSBAb) which blocks the action of TSH hormone and subsequently brings damage and atrophy to thyroid gland. Approximately 15-20% of patients with Graves' disease had been reported to have spontaneous hypothyroidism resulting from the chronic thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease). Pathogenesis for chronic thyroiditis following anti-thyroid drug treatment in patients with Graves' disease remains unclear. It has been estimated that chronic thyroiditis or Hashimoto's disease, which occurs following the Graves' disease episode is due to extended immune response in Graves' disease. It includes the immune response to endogenous thyroid antigens, i.e. thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin, which may enhance lymphocyte infiltration and finally causes Hashimoto's thyroiditis. We report four cases of chronic thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease) in patients who have been previously diagnosed with Graves' hyperthyroidism. In three cases, Hashimoto's thyroiditis occurs in 7 to 25 years after the treatment of Grave's disease; while the other case has it only after few months of Grave's disease treatment. The diagnosis of Hashimoto's disease (chronic thyroiditis) was based on clinical manifestation, high TSHs level, positive thyroid peroxidase antibody and thyroglobulin antibody, and supported by positive results of fine needle aspiration biopsy. Moreover, the result of histopathological test has also confirmed the diagnosis in two cases. All cases have been successfully treated by levothyroxine treatment.",,"thyroxine; adult; article; case report; female; Graves disease; Hashimoto disease; human; male; middle aged; Adult; Female; Graves Disease; Hashimoto Disease; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Thyroxine","Umar, H.email: husani_umar65@yahoo.co.id",,,01259326,,,20305330,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957259069

Although a rigorous and sophisticated set of therapeutic procedure has been applied in the disease management, mortality rate has yet unchanged during the last twenty years. This fact necessitates an alternative or adjuvant therapy that is critically safe and capable of repairing the injured vascular as well as regenerating the infarcted myocardium without omitting the ethical considerations. Stem cell therapy could be the answer. It has gained major basic and clinical research interest, ever since its discovered potential to repair the injured vascular in 1997. Multiple cell types across lineages have been shown to be able to transdifferentiate into mature functioning cardiomyocytes either in vitro through similar phenotypical and genotypical characteristics or in vivo by regenerating the infarcted myocardium and improve contractile function. Although the exact repairing mechanisms are still in a major debate, numerous clinical trials have demonstrated favorable effects toward the use of autologous stem cells in AMI patients with considerably low side effects. Despite the relatively novel discovery, stem cell therapy offers a promising prospect to confer a better protection, prevent later complications, and perhaps reduce the mortality among patients with ischemic heart disease.

As a treatment for any infection, a tendency of using drug combination has a strong role against resistance and preventing resistance to primary drug. Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone of anti-malaria drug which is characterized by its blood schizonticides nature to P. falciparum and P. vivax. It has been developed from an ancient Chinese traditional drug for patient with fever, which is made from an extract of Artemesia annua L (qinghao) and has been used since thousand of years ago and was found by Chinese researchers in 1971. Artemisinin has been used for mild malaria as combination drug (ACT) and for severe malaria by using intra-vena or intra-muscular artesunate, or by using artemether for intra-muscular purpose only. Patients with malaria should have their blood slides to be examined on day 2, 3, and day 7, 14, 21, and 28.

METHODS: this was a cross-sectional study on breast cancer patients in Dharmais Cancer Hospital between 1998 and 2002. Data were retrieved from medical records and consisted of age, history of hormonal contraceptive use, histopathological type, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesteron receptor (PR) expression, c-erbB-2 and cathepsin D expressions. RESULTS: a total of 197 cases were recruited between the study period. Almost all patients were women with a mean age of 47 years old. The majority of patients were between 36 and 55 years old (69.1%) with a peak between 46 and 50 years. About 70% of the patients had already had advanced diseases (III and IV).

Low density lipoprotein (LDL), which may be modified by oxidation, glycation, aggregation, association with proteoglycans, or incorporation into immune complexes, is a major cause of injury to the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC).The major major cell types involved in atherogenesis, macrophages and VSMC, are activated by pro-inflammatory stimuli including modified LDL. Modified LDL induces inflammatory responses in macrophages, migration and proliferation of SMC, and triggers foam cell formation. Scavenger receptors, including LOX-1, play a key role in foam cell formation by mediating the uptake of modified LDL. LOX-1 expression is detected in endothelial cells of early atherosclerosis lesions of human carotid arteries. Advanced lesions showed LOX-1 expression not only in endothelial cells but also in macrophages and more frequently in VSMC, and may be involved in foam cell transformation in macrophages and VSMC. The metabolic abnormalities that characterize diabetes, particularly hyperglycemia, free fatty acids, and insulin resistance, provoke molecular mechanisms that alter the function and structure of blood vessels. These include increased oxidative stress, intracellular signal transduction disturbances, and activation of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (R-AGE). Data showed that LOX-1 expression is enhanced by proatherogenic factors relevant to human diabetes, including high glucose, oxLDL, advance glycation end products, and C-reactive protein.

The aim of this study is to evaluate clinical, laboratory and ultrasound parameters to detect esophageal varices. METHODS: this is a cross sectional study. Fourty seven consecutive cirrhotic patients without history of variceal hemorrhage underwent upper endoscopy. Physical examination, laboratory and ultrasonography to find portal vein diameter and anterioposterior splenic measurement of each patient were also recorded. RESULTS: esophageal varices was detected in 36 of the 47 patients (76.6%). Using bivariate analysis we found that a platelet count of 82,000/ul (90.9% sensitivity; 41.7% specificity), portal vein diameter of 1.15 cm (75% sensitivity; 54.5% pecificity) and an anteroposterior splenic measurement of 10.3 cm (83.3% sensitivity; 63.6% specificity) were predictive factors for esophageal varices in liver cirrhosis.

Risk behaviour associated with injecting drug use, such as sharing contaminated needles, is the main risk factor for HIV infection. Among the general population the prevalence of HIV-infection is still low (0.2%), but up to 50% or more of the estimated 145.000 - 170.000 injecting drug users are already HIV-positive. Overrepresentation of injecting drug users and continued risk behavior inside Indonesian prisons contribute to spread of HIV. Through sexual contacts, HIV is transmitted from current or previous injecting drug users to their non-injecting sexual partners; 10-20% of this group may already be infected. The national response targeted to limit spread of HIV through injecting drug use has included needle and syringe program (NSP), methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), voluntary counseling and testing (VCT), and outreach program as priority programs. However coverage and utilization of the harm reduction services is still limited, but effective integration with HIV testing and treatment is expanding. By 2008, there were 110 service points for NSP and 24 operational MMT clinics. Nevertheless, utilization of these services has been less satisfactory and their effectiveness has been questioned. Besides effective prevention, HIV- testing and earlier treatment of HIV-seropositve individuals, including those with a history of injecting drug use, will help control the growing HIV-epidemic in Indonesia.",,"article; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Indonesia; opiate substitution treatment; preventive health service; substance abuse; HIV Infections; Humans; Indonesia; Needle-Exchange Programs; Opiate Substitution Treatment; Substance Abuse, Intravenous","Afriandi, I.email: irvan_afr@yahoo.com.au",,,01259326,,,19920303,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956395523

It is defined as the process of sequestrating cytoplasmic proteins or even entire organelles into the lytic compartment (lysosome/vacuole). This study investigates the expression of autophagy in Hodgkin lymphoma cells treated with various anti-cancer drugs. METHODS: Hodgkin's lymphoma cells (HD-My-Z cells) were cultured with various anti-cancer drugs, such as bleomycin, adriamycin, gemcitabine and paclitaxel. Autophagy was detected by fluorescent pattern of light chain 3(LC3) proteins and the apoptotic cell death was determined by annexin V binding. RESULTS: autophagy was detected in HD-My-Z cells treated with gemcitabine, but not with bleomycin, adriamycin and paclitaxel. Adriamycin exhibited the strongest cytotoxic action, and the cytotoxic action of bleomycin and gemcitabine was less marked compared with adriamycin. Paclitaxel did not cause significant cell death in the cells. CONCLUSION: autophagy was differentially expressed in Hodgkin lymphoma cells treated with anti-cancer drugs and the expression did not correspond to the apoptotic cell death.",,"antineoplastic agent; bleomycin; cytotoxin; deoxycytidine; doxorubicin; drug derivative; gemcitabine; lipocortin 5; paclitaxel; apoptosis; article; autophagy; cell survival; culture technique; drug effect; Hodgkin disease; human; pilot study; Annexin A5; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Apoptosis; Autophagy; Bleomycin; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Survival; Cytotoxins; Deoxycytidine; Doxorubicin; Hodgkin Disease; Humans; Paclitaxel; Pilot Projects","Oehadian, A.",,,01259326,,,18046059,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44449093751

Three class of targeted therapy were developed, including multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex-1 kinase inhibitors, and the humanized antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody. Hence, the objective of this article was to critically examine the current evidence of targeted therapy treatment for patients with mRCC. In the majority of trials evaluating targeted therapy, patients were stratified according to Memorial Sloan Kattering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk model and the recommendation of targeted treatment based on risk features. In first-line setting (no previous treatment), sunitinib, pazopanib, or bevacizumab plus IFN-α were recommended as treatment options for patient with favorable- or intermediate- risk features and clear cell histology. Patients who progressed after previous cytokine therapy would have sorafenib or axitinib as treatment options. Clear-cell mRCC with favorable- or intermediate- risk features and failure with first-line TKI therapy might be treated with sorafenib, everolimus, temsirolimus or axitinib. However, the current evidence did not show the best treatment sequencing after first-line TKI failure. In patients with poor-risk clear-cell and non-clear cell mRCC, temsirolimus was the treatment option supported by phase III clinical trial. In addition, several new drugs, nowadays, are still being investigated and waiting for the result of phase II or III clinical trial, and this might change the standard therapy for mRCC in the future.","clear cell; metastatic; non-clear cell; renal cell carcinoma; sequential therapy targeted therapy","alpha interferon; angiogenesis inhibitor; antineoplastic agent; axitinib; bevacizumab; carbanilamide derivative; everolimus; imidazole derivative; immunologic factor; indazole derivative; indole derivative; nicotinamide; pazopanib; protein kinase inhibitor; pyrimidine derivative; pyrrole derivative; rapamycin; sorafenib; sulfonamide; sunitinib; temsirolimus; analogs and derivatives; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; human; Kidney Neoplasms; pathology; prognosis; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Antineoplastic Agents; Bevacizumab; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Everolimus; Humans; Imidazoles; Immunologic Factors; Indazoles; Indoles; Interferon-alpha; Kidney Neoplasms; Niacinamide; Phenylurea Compounds; Prognosis; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Pyrimidines; Pyrroles; Sirolimus; Sulfonamides",,,,01259326,,,28143997,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011958862

RESULTS: during the study, 118 adult individuals can be covered, including 88 patients (68,8%) with metabolic syndrome. They consist of 19 subjects who had only 1 component, 21 subjects had 2 components, 31 subjects with 3 components, 34 subjects with 4 components, and 23 subjects had 5 component. All subjects were overweight/obese (BMI > 23 kg/m), but patients with metabolic syndrome were significantly more obese compared to the non-metabolic syndrome (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in age among all individuals. Fasting insulin, hs-CRP levels is increasing with the increasing number of components of metabolic syndrome, being higher among those with 3-5 components, while adiponectin is decreasing with the number of the components. Fasting insulin 3,5+1,1 uU/ml, 3,6+1,4 uU/ml, 5,9+1,8 uU/ml, 7,8+2,1 uU/ml, 7,9+2,3 uU/ml respectively, hs-CRP 2,8+1,2 mg/L, 5.6+3.4 mg/L, 7.4+4.4 mg/L, 9.0+4.7 mg/L, 9.5+3,9 mg/L, and adiponectin 9.1+3.5 ng/ml, 8.6+1.6 ng/ml, 3.4+1.2 ng/ml, 3.2+1.3 ng/ml, 2.8+0.9 ng/ml in 3,4,5 components respectively. CONCLUSION: there is a relationship between the number of components of metabolic syndrome and the increasing levels of fasting insulin, and hs-CRP, and low levels of adiponectin. These may explain in part the risk of cardiovascular events among individuals with metabolic syndrome.",,"adiponectin; biological marker; C reactive protein; insulin; adult; article; blood; diet restriction; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; follow up; human; male; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; middle aged; physiology; prognosis; retrospective study; risk factor; Adiponectin; Adult; Biological Markers; C-Reactive Protein; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Fasting; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Insulin; Male; Metabolic Syndrome X; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors","Adam, F.M.",,,01259326,,,17132879,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34347399235

Oxidative stress, as non-traditional risk factors, is not only able to explain the high incidence of cardiovascular disease in CKD, but also become a new target in therapeutic intervention. Oxidative stress in patients with CKD appears due to increased oxidant activity and decreased antioxidant system.

Novel biomarkers that rise earlier, has a good diagnosis accuracy and has additional prognostic information, are highly needed. There are some potential emerging novel biomarkers for acute myocardial infarction. High sensitivity troponin have a greater sensitivity and accuracy for detection and early exclusion of myocardial infarction, as compared to troponin.

METHODS: This was a historical cohort study of hip fracture cases underwent partial hip replacement in Siaga Raya Hospital, Jakarta between January 1997 and December 2006. Patients' clinical assessment included sex, age at surgery, ambulatory state, the number of underlying disease or comorbidities, hemoglobin and serum albumin levels, type of fracture and elapsed time between the day of fracture and day of surgery. All patients underwent partial hip surgery. Functional outcome after surgery was assessed by Harris' Hip Score (HHS). A score below 80 points was considered poor. Kaplan-Meier curve with log-rank test was deployed and Cox proportional hazard model was performed to identify independent risk factors associated with poor HHS after surgery. RESULTS: Harris hip score could be obtained from 123 patients during the study period. The patients' mean age at surgery was 73+/-9.8 years old. Cox regression analysis showed several risk factors for poor HHS after partial hip replacement procedures, i.e. age at surgery 75 years or more, the presence of two or more comorbidities, anemia and Low albumin. In adjusted model, the number of comorbidities, anemia and Low albumin were confirmed to be independent risk factors for poor HHS after surgery.

Body mass index is a simple method for defining the degree of overweight and obesity, however, waist circumference is the preferred measure of abdominal obesity because it has greater relationship with the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Body fatness reflects the interactions of development, environment and genetic factors. The role of genetic factors has already existed, nevertheless, environment factors are likely more important in developing obesity. Increased mortality among the obese is evident for several life-threatening diseases including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, gallbladder disease, and hormone-sensitive and gastrointestinal cancers. Risks are also higher for some non-fatal conditions such as back pain, arthritis, infertility and, in many westernized countries, poor psychosocial functioning. Obesity is not only threatening health, also impacts on high economic and social cost. Effective prevention of obesity should be focused to high risk individuals or groups. Individuals who have some existing weight-related problems and those with a high risk of developing obesity co-morbidity such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes should be a key priority in this prevention strategy. Although weight loss in obese persons of any age can improve obesity-related medical complications, physical function, and quality of life, the primary purpose for weigh-loss therapy may differ across age group. The current therapeutic tools available for weight management are: (1) lifestyle intervention involving diet, physical activity, and behavior modification; (2) pharmacotherapy; and (3) surgery. Moderate weight loss (5-10% of initial weight) by any programs is a realistic target in management of obesity associated with improvement of risk factors of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.",,"anorexigenic agent; human; lifestyle; methodology; obesity; review; treatment outcome; weight reduction; Appetite Depressants; Bariatrics; Humans; Life Style; Obesity; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss","Suastika, K.",,,01259326,,,17132890,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34447617258

METHODS: Subjects were lung cancer patients at Dr. Kariadi hospital Semarang between January 2002 and December 2003. Diagnosis was made based on clinical symptoms, histologic examination and lateral chest radiograph, and thorax CT scan. Density of tumor was measured within area which had most enhancements before and after contrast administration. Then, it was followed by transthoraxic fine needle aspiration (TNFNAB) and histopathologic examination. Study design was a cross sectional study. Inclusion criteria were primary lung cancer and exclusion criteria were non lung cancer, metastatic cancer, histopathologic non interpreted. Estimated number of samples was 41 patients. Density value before and after contrast were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank test. Difference of tumor density for each type of cancer cell was analyzed using chi-square test with significant level at p < 0.05 and confidence interval of 95%. RESULTS: Forty-one patients with lung cancer were enrolled in this study. There were 30 males (73.2%) and 11 females (26.8%). Histopathologic types of cell cancer were epidermoid in 17 patients (14.5%), adenocarcinoma 8 patients (19.5%), large cell 7 patients ( 17.1%), small cell 7 patients ( 17.1%) and undifferentiated cell 2 patients ( 4.5%).

The WHO recommends that all those with abnormal fasting glucose should undergo the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to exclude the diagnosis of diabetes (two-step strategy). This two-step strategy will leave out subjects with normal fasting glucose (<109 mg/dl). The aim of this study is to compare the WHO two-step strategy and the gold standard OGTT for all subjects. We re-analyzed the results of 907 high-risk patients who have been screened for diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance. All subjects were screened with an OGTT containing a 75-gram glucose load after fasting for 12 hours. The results were classified into three categories: the ADA criteria, the two-step strategy, and the OGTT. Using the ADA criteria, these 907 subjects can be classified has having normal fasting glucose (fasting plasma glucose - FPG < 109 mg/dl) in 715 subjects (78.9%), abnormal fasting glucose (FPG 110 - 125 mg/dl) in 107 subjects (11.8%), and diabetes mellitus (FPG > 126 mg/dl) in 85 subjects (9.4%). The WHO two-step strategy performed in 107 IFG subjects identified another 30 diabetic patients (FPG < 109 mg/dl and 2 hour post load > 200 mg/dl = IPCH) or 3.3%, and 49 patients with IGT, or 5.4% from all subjects. If the OGTT was performed on the 715 normal fasting glucose, it could identify another 40 diabetic patients or 4.4%, and another 178 IGT patients, or 19.6% of all subjects. This means that without OGTT to all subjects, 40 diabetic patients or 25.8% of all diabetic patients and 178 patients or 78.4% from all IGT subjects would have remained unidentified. From this study we can conclude that applying the WHO two-step strategy in subjects with IFG would fail to detect 25.8% of diabetic patients and 78.4% of IGT subjects. It is recommended that the old strategy of screening--the gold standard OGTT--should be used instead of the two-step strategy, at least in high-risk groups.",,"adult; age; aged; article; comparative study; diabetes mellitus; diet restriction; evaluation; female; glucose blood level; glucose intolerance; glucose tolerance test; health service; human; male; mass screening; medical society; methodology; middle aged; risk assessment; standard; world health organization; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus; Fasting; Female; Glucose Intolerance; Glucose Tolerance Test; Humans; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Risk Assessment; Societies, Medical; Voluntary Health Agencies; World Health Organization","Adam, J.M.",,,01259326,,,15931695,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-24044450295

Those with urinary tract infection and diabetes mellitus were excluded. The UI questionnaire was adapted from the 3 Incontinence Questions (3IQ). Written informed consent was obtained prior to the interview.RESULTS: about 2765 completed questionnaires were obtained. The overall UI prevalence was 13.0%, which consisted of prevalence of stress UI (4.0%), urgency UI/wet OAB (4.1%), dry OAB (1.6%), mixed UI (1.6%), overflow UI (0.4%), enuresis (0.4%), other UI (0.7%). The prevalence of UI was significantly higher (p<0.001) in geriatric population (22.2%) compared to the adult (12.0%), and pediatric population (6.8%). There was no prevalence difference (p>0.05) between male and female subjects. Enuresis and urgency UI/wet OAB were the most common UI in pediatric population. The prevalence was 2.3% and 2.1% respectively. Urgency UI and stress UI were the two most common type in adult and geriatric population. Both have an equal prevalence of 4.6%. The multivariate analysis showed that the prevalence of UI increased with LUTS (PR 4.22, 95%CI 2.98-5.97), chronic cough (PR 2.08, 95% CI 1.32-3.28), and fecal incontinence (PR 1.85, 95% CI 1.03-3.32). We found that UI impaired family life (25.3%), sexual relationship (13.6%), and job/school performance (23.7%). Frequent toilet use and reducing fluid intake were the two most common behavior changes.CONCLUSION: the prevalence of UI in Indonesia is nearly similar to other Asian countries. It increases with age and is not affected by gender. LUTS, chronic cough, and fecal incontinence may have significant effects on the prevalence.

Bartley criteria were used as clinical criteria for GO. In addition to clinical criteria, orbital CT scan and measurement of extraocular muscle thickness and increment of retroorbital fat volume were carried out. Furthermore, TSH, FT4, FT3 and TRAb were measured using ELISA method, TSAb and TBAb using RIA method. Clinical activity of GO was measured using clinical activity score (CAS). Degree of severity of GO was measured using Eckstein modified NOSPECS system. subjects consisted of various different ethnic groups in Indonesia, with the range of age between 20-63 years old. There were 28 (37%) and 61 (83.6%) GO subjects with clinical-based and CT scan-based respectively. Among all GD subjects, the proportion of TSAb were 70 (93.3%) and TBAb were 13 (17.3%). There was no correlation between TRAb and CAS nor the severity of GO, either clinical-based and CT scan-based GO. There was also no correlation between TSAb and CAS. No correlation between TSAb and severity of CT scan-based GO, but significant correlation between TSAb and severity of clinical-based GO (r=0.274; p=0.009) was noted. There was no correlation between TBAb and severity of GO. We also found no correlation between TBAb and CAS of clinical-based GO, but we found strong negative correlation with CAS CT scan-based GO (r=-0.565; p=0.035). The TSAb/TBAb ratio was also strongly correlated with all parameters evaluated, CAS of clinical-based GO (r=0.730; p=0.031), CAS of CT scan-based GO (r=0.607; p=0.024), degree of severity of clinical-based GO (r=0.563; p=0.023), and degree of severity of CT scan-based GO (r=0.762; p=0.001). TRAb was not correlated with CAS and degree of severity of clinical-based and CT scan-based GO, while TSAb was correlated with degree of severity of GO.

METHODS: The study design was randomized pre and post control group design involving 40 adult patients admitted to the ICU of Sanglah Hospital, Denpasar. The study subjects were randomly allocated into two groups: the first group to receive intensive insulin therapy in which blood glucose was set at a level between 80 - 110 mg/dL; the second group to receive conventional insulin therapy, which was given if the blood glucose level exceeded 215 mg/dL and to be maintained at the level of between 180 - 200 mg/dL. RESULTS: This study showed: (1) There was a significant increase of SOD in the group receiving intensive insulin therapy as compared to the conventional insulin therapy (370.70 vs. 98.50 U/gHb, p=0.001), (2) There was no significant decrease in the TNF-alpha level, (3) There was a significant decrease of IL-6 level (10.25 vs. 2.02; p=0.023); (4) There was a significant decrease in the event of SIRS (10% vs. 45%, p=0.000) in the intensive insulin therapy group as compared to the conventional insulin therapy group. CONCLUSION: Increase of insulin dose in the intensive insulin therapy can maintain blood glucose at normoglycemic level between 80 - 110 mg/dL faster than that in the conventional insulin therapy.

There is a study indicating that type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is frequently found in children and teenager. Furthermore, in some countries, it is more frequent than type 1 diabetes mellitus.1 WHO stated that in the year of 2000, there were 177 million diabetes mellitus patient in the world and it is predicted that in the year of 2030, it will be increased to 366 million.2 This is very problematical for some countries such as India, People's Republic of China and Indonesia where the prevention and treatment facilities are still inadequate. To date, Indonesia has occupied the 4th rank, with predicted number of diabetes mellitus patient about 8.4 million and this number will be increased to 21.3 million in the year of 2030. There is no data about the number of patient with metabolic syndrome (MS) and insulin resistance syndrome (IR), but it should be higher than the number of diabetic patient. As we all have known, these conditions are the high-risk condition of diabetes mellitus development.2 One of reasons concerning why prevalence and pre-diabetic condition are increased (including the increased MS) is rising obesity frequency. In the United States, over 60% of recent adult population are overweight, which is defined as ""body mass index"" (BMI) 25; and about 30% of them have obesity, which is defined as BMI 30%.3 If diabetes mellitus occurred, cardiovascular disease (CVD) including coronary heart disease (CHD) also may occur.

It can be due to either potassium deficiency (inadequate potassium intake or excessive potassium loss) or to net potassium shifts from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment. Inadequate dietary intake of potassium alone rarely causes hypokalemia since kidney is able to lower potassium excretion below 15 mmol per day. Hypokalemia due to excessive potassium loss can be due to renal or extrarenal losses. It is not necessary to wait for a timed urine collection for potassium to determine the etiology of hypokalemia. Measurement of spot urine for potassium and creatinine as well as evaluation of acid-base status can be used as an initial step in the diagnosis of hypokalemia. Subsequent evaluations such as measurement of spot urinary chloride, blood pressure, serum aldosterone, renin and cortisol levels may be needed in certain circumstances.",,"potassium; human; hypokalemia; kidney tubule acidosis; physiology; review; risk factor; Acidosis, Renal Tubular; Humans; Hypokalemia; Potassium; Risk Factors","Lim, S.",,,01259326,,,17297212,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38449092008

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed from male visitors in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital between February and August 2001. 40 - 90 years old, without significantly severe disease or other conditions that can affect physical, psychological, or sexual activities. They were interviewed by four trained interviewers using a standardized questionnaire, an aging males' symptoms (AMS) questionnaire consisting of 17 items including psychological, somatic and sexual questions. Degrees of andropause were calculated based on the total score of the questionnaire. The participants were also asked about the impact of the symptoms of andropause toward their quality of life (impact question), whether they could accept their condition or not. Data were analyzed using Stata version 8.2 for Windows XP computer packaged. Factors that influenced the acceptance of andropause were analyzed using logistic regression. RESULTS: The proportion of andropause was 70.94 %. Among them, 193 (54.52%) participants were categorized as having mild andropause, followed by 138 (38.95%) as intermediate, and only 23 (6.5%) with severe andropause. Among the 354 participants who experienced andropause, only 124 (35.03%) could not accept their condition, while the rest 230 participants (64.97%) could accept the symptoms of andropause. The degree of andropause and marriage status can affect the acceptance of andropause. The more severe the degree of andropause, the more they cannot accept the conditions (OR 2.19, 95%CI 1.28; 3.73). The married men are more tolerant to their conditions compared to the widower (OR 2.4, 95%CI 1.08; 5.32). The white collar workers are more willing to accept the symptoms of andropause than the blue-collar workers (OR 2.07, 95%CI 1.28; 3.73).

METHODS: Random samples of 3080 subjects aged 40-94 years were obtained from various districts in every big island in Indonesia. Blood pressure measurements, as well as assessment on history of hypertension, use of anti-hypertensive medications, and social demographic characteristics were performed. Blood pressure measurements were obtained by trained doctors with the subjects in supine position. Stepwise multiple logistic regression was used to determine variables which were most associated with treatment without anti-hypertensive medication in hypertensive subjects. RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension without anti-hypertensive medication among 40 years and above adult population in Indonesia was 37.32% (677 our of 1814 hypertensive subjects). From bivariate analysis, we found that male sex, older age, informal education and unemployment were associated with the use of anti-hypertensive medication. Multivariate analysis shows that male sex (OR=1.33), education level of elementary school (OR=1.50), and government employment (OR=1.24) are significantly as risk factors for not taking anti-hypertensive medication.

METHODS: There were 26 chronic dialyzed patients and 26 pradialyzed patients. Technicon H-1 was used to examine peripheral blood count; blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were examined using standard technique. MEIA (microparticle enzyme immunoassay) was used for serum folic acid and serum B12 level. RESULTS: Of 52 CRF patients, hemoglobin (Hb) levels ranged from 4.6 g/dl to 15.1 g/dl with a mean of 9.3 +/- 2.7 g/dl. Hematocrit levels ranged from 15.3% to 49.3%, with a mean of 29.8 +/- 7.9%. There was a significant difference in the hemoglobin and hematocrit levels of chronic dialyzed and pradialyzed patients. The prevalence of anemia (according to the WHO's criteria) among CRF patients was 84.5% (45/52), with the prevalence in chronic dialyzed patients being 100% and 73.1% in pradialyzed patients. If a hemoglobin level of less than 10 g/dl is used as a cut off point, the prevalence of anemia in dialyzed patients was 96.2% and 30.8% among pradialyzed patients. The severity of anemia among 26 dialyzed patients was: severe in 2 cases (8%), moderate in 16 cases (64%) and mild in 7 cases (28%), while in pradialytic patients the severity of anemia was: moderate in 4 patients (50%) and mild in 4 (50%). The morphology of 33 anemic patients was normocrhomic normocytic in 26 (78.8%) cases, slightly macrocytic in 7 (21.2%) cases, and no hypochromic anemia was found. Two anemic patients were associated with low serum folic acid (1 patient with macrocytic anemia and the other case with normochromic normocytic anemia). The serum B12 level was found to be normal in all cases. There was no significant correlation between the severity of anemia and serum creatinine levels or duration of hemodialysis. CONCLUSION: Anemia is a hallmark for CRF patients with a high prevalence of anemia and moderate degree of anemia. Most of anemic cases were normochromic normocytic. Loss of renal mass could be the principle mechanism. In a small proportion of patients, folic acid deficiency may be the cause of anemia. In this study, iron deficiency anemia was not likely an important factor since no hypochromic anemia was found.",,"folic acid; adult; aged; anemia; article; chronic kidney failure; comparative study; female; hospital; human; Indonesia; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; prevalence; renal replacement therapy; Adult; Aged; Anemia; Female; Folic Acid; Hospitals; Humans; Indonesia; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Renal Dialysis","Suega, K.",,,01259326,,,16354939,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33644873379

Afterwards, histopathological evaluation and study of the protein expression of the gastric mucosa were performed. the results showed that longer exposure to hypoxic conditions leads to more severe gastric ulceration. Twenty-four hours after induction, 60% of rats had developed gastric ulcers. Seven days after induction, 80% of rats developed gastric ulcers. In the 14-day and 21-day hypoxia conditions, epithelialization (a sign of gastric ulcer healing) was observed. Evaluation of the average ulcer depth on the day of treatment showed that the greatest depth was on day 7, and the shallowest was on day 21 of treatment. Western blot analyses demonstrated that systemic hypoxia resulted in the expression of heat shock factor (HSF) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP-70), which were highest on day 7 and then regressed gradually.

Until now, diabetes treatment cannot restore the reduced function of pancreatic beta cell. McIntyre et al stated that there is a factor from the intestine which stimulates insulin secretion as a response on glucose.This factor is known as incretin. It is a hormone which is released by the intestine due to ingested food especially those which contain carbohydrate and fat. Currently, there are 2 types of incretin hormones which have been identified, i.e.Glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1). These two hormones act by triggering insulin release immediately after food ingestion, inhibiting glucagon secretion, delaying stomach emptying, and suppressing hunger sensation. Several in vitro studies have demonstrated that these two incretin hormones may increase the proliferation of pancreatic beta cell.There is a decrease of GIP function and GLP-1 amount in type-2 diabetes mellitus; thus the attempt to increase both incretin hormones - in this case by using GLP-1 agonist and DPP-IV inhibitor - is one of treatment modalities to control the glucose blood level, either as a monotherapy or a combination therapy. Currently, there are two approaches of incretin utilization as one of type-2 diabetes mellitus treatment, which is the utilization of incretin mimetic/agonist and DPP-IV inhibitor.",,"dipeptidyl peptidase IV; DPP4 protein, human; gastric inhibitory polypeptide; glucagon like peptide 1; incretin; disease course; drug antagonism; human; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas islet beta cell; pathophysiology; physiology; review; Antigens, CD26; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Disease Progression; Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Incretins; Insulin-Secreting Cells","Sanusi, H.email: endhy404@yahoo.com",,,01259326,,,20737753,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957285265

This is due to overrepresentation of injecting drug users (IDUs) in prison and possible HIV-transmission inside prison. Limited health services in penitentiary institutes, stigma, policy issues, and budgetary constraints may hamper delivery of appropriate services for HIV in prison. Prisons may, on the other hand, enable the access to a high risk population for HIV-prevention and -care. IDUs are namely hard to reach outside prisons, while in prison targeted interventions for IDUs can be used repeatedly and economically. Also, harm reduction and HIV-treatment can be supervised and monitored carefully. This paper reviews HIV-prevention and care in prison, and describes the experience in one particular prison in West Java, Indonesia. Based on the literature and local experience, one can conclude that effective and widespread HIV-testing and treatment can be established in prisons if there is commitment from prison authorities, endorsement of services by prison staff and inmates, and collaboration with health care providers from outside prison. Essential components of HIV-services in prison include appropriate health care services, a suitable environment for HIV-counseling and -testing and tailored services for injecting drug use. By partner counseling and linking HIV-services in prison with continued care afterwards, prisons may contribute significantly to HIV-control in the general population, especially in settings where HIV is often due to injecting drug use.",,"article; disease transmission; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Indonesia; patient care; prison; prisoner; substance abuse; Continuity of Patient Care; HIV Infections; Humans; Indonesia; Prisoners; Prisons; Substance Abuse, Intravenous","Nelwan, E.J.email: ejnelwan@yahoo.com",,,01259326,,,19920299,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649701198

However, there was limited information regarding molecular process responsible for this phenomenon. This paper was aimed to present a brief update on recent studies explaining the effect of estrogen on adipose tissue lipolysis and the molecular pathway involved in this process. It is suggested that the effect of estrogen to reduction of lipolysis was through activation of estrogen receptor alpha (ER-α) in adipose tissue. This finding is supported by the fact that mice lacking of ESR1 gene (encodes ER-α) accumulate more fat and ESR1 mRNA in human adipose tissue was inversely correlated with body mass index (BMI). Future study should be aimed to clarify the role of ER-α on lipolysis in adipose tissue during weight loss intervention. Additionally, new pharmacological or nutritional treatment with ability to modulate ER-α activity/expression could be used as a potential weight loss intervention.",,"estrogen; estrogen receptor alpha; adipocyte; adipose tissue; animal; body weight; female; human; lipolysis; obesity; pathophysiology; physiology; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Body Weight; Estrogen Receptor alpha; Estrogens; Female; Humans; Lipolysis; Obesity",,,,01259326,,,25633552,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942579823

The conduct of phase I clinical trials is considered more sophisticated and difficult than the later stage clinical trials. There are continuing concerns from the pharmaceutical industries about the capacity of Asian countries in conducting this type of clinical trials. We highlighted several problems concerning the ethical and scientific issues, the implementation of ICH-GCP and local regulations, investigators and clinical trial subjects.

The study was conducted among 487 elderly in 43 cities in Indonesia between November-December 2010. A structured questionnaire was applied to obtain independent variable such as age, sex, number of diseases, present activities, functional status (ADL score), cognitive status (AMT score), nutritional status (NRI score), and depression status. Quality of life as dependent variable was assessed by Euroqol-5D (Eq-5D). We defined good quality of life as 3 or more dimensions of Eq5D having score of 1. Predictors of quality of life were identified using multiple logistic regression analysis. We constructed a scoring system based on coefficients in multivariable analysis. Calibration performance of the score was evaluated by Hosmer-Lemeshow tests while discrimination performance was evaluated with the c-statistic. most of the subjects were male (52.2%) and aged between 60-70 years old (75.8%). Prevalence of poor quality of life in this study was 14.9%. Bivariable analysis showed that all independent variables were significantly associated with quality of life.

Various dose administrations of anti-malarial treatment, instead of the standard dose and single dose treatment is probably one of possible causes. Another problem in Indonesia includes the shortage in diagnostic facilities as well as various kinds of treatment available. In 2009, Ministry of Health, Republic of Indonesia has declared the program of Malaria Elimination 2009 to overcome the problems. The policy includes diagnosis and treatment of malaria. It is expected that diagnosis should be established based on the gold standard by confirmation of blood smears. Moreover, first line treatment of malaria shall include the Artemisinin Combination Therapy (ACT). Artemisinin is selected as it has some advantages and it should be combined to prevent resistance.

WHO (World Health Organization) 1993 has estimated that one third of world population has been infected by M. tuberculosis bacillus. It is also estimated that 8 million people contract the disease annually and two to three million deaths occur every year due to TB. Major factors that have aggravated the spread of TB are: 1) ineffective TB control programs, leading to the development of multi drug resistant bacilli, 2) co infection with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) where TB progress rapidly and deadly,3) existence of other co-morbid that need higher expert (Internist etc). Vaccination with BCG does not seem to protect the adult population consistently and effectively from developing pulmonary TB, and has had no significant impact on the global TB epidemiology. Tuberculosis in Indonesia results in high death rate because it is the second highest infection with national prevalence rate of 0.24%. Effective medicine standard of anti-tuberculosis is available, but many obstacles in the program from lack of knowledge among health officers, low consciousness and compliances of person with tuberculosis to carry out the treatment schedule and so on make the success of TB eradication unsatisfied. Clinical appearances of TB are multiple with non-specific symptoms, the cases that are exposed to similar source of infection but will show different clinical consequence from mild to severe. Nevertheless, with the rise of multi drug resistance strains of M. tuberculosis, the spread of HIV infection and the variation of BCG efficacy, the search for more powerful drugs, more effective vaccines, better diagnostics and other intervention strategies have become an urgent goal worldwide.

Meta-analysis of 2175 patients, 81 mg BCG was found to be superior to 27 mg in reducing tumour recurrences (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.77-0.96, I2=0% and p=0.008). Meta-analysis of 544 patients, the effectiveness reducing tumour recurrences in 27 mg BCG was found to be superior to 13,5 BCG (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.49-0.89, I2=8.8% and p=0.006). Systemic side effects were happened in 25%, 28.5%, and 15.5% in the doses 81.27 and 13.5 mg BCG, respectively. Low dose was superior to full dose in affecting systemic side effect (p=0,000) but no difference in affecting local side effect (p=0.137) in the meta-analysis of 1816 patients in 2 clinical trials.CONCLUSION: Full dose BCG had superior outcome to reduce recurrences compared to low dose and very low dose. There were no significant differences between each dose in local side effect. However full dose regimen has higher systemic side effect compared to low and very low dose.",,"BCG vaccine; carcinoma; dose response; human; intravesical drug administration; meta analysis; pathology; randomized controlled trial (topic); tumor invasion; tumor recurrence; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms; Administration, Intravesical; BCG Vaccine; Carcinoma; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Humans; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms",,,,01259326,,,25633546,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942594149

Surgical site infection is the most common perioperative infection causing increased hospitalization stay, high cost, morbidity and mortality rate. Infection occurs within 30 days after the operation on surgical site or within one year if implant is in place. Such infection may be prevented through several ways including some aspects of health-care provider, operating-room environment, and adequate preoperative preparation of the patients. Antibiotic prophylaxis is one of important modalities in preventing surgical site infection. Antibiotic prophylaxis administration significantly reduces the incidence of surgical site infection up to four-fold of decrease. Short-term antibiotic is given prior to incision in order to reduce the contamination of bacterial inoculums during surgery. The decision to administer antibiotic prophylaxis should be made by considering their risk and benefits. One of them includes utilization of the NNIS (National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance) score system, which considers three factors, such as wound class, ASA physical status scale, and duration of operation according to the NNIS Survey.

Starting from this point, cytogenetics as the study of chromosomes has become a valuable tool in the assessment of cancer - as an aid in diagnosis, thus guiding therapy, and as a prognostic marker. As is the nature of the proliferating marrow, chromosomal abnormalities were found mostly in hematologic malignancies, and the findings more pathognomonic.

Unfortunately, in many cases, the etiologies were unclear and resulted in a wrong treatment. Indeed, the true etiology could be such a 'rare' one and could be found by doing a comprehensive work up. One of this is Gitelman's syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypokalemic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hypocalciuria, and secondary aldosteronism without hypertension. Since this disorder is found in 1% Caucasian populations, this is one of the most frequently inherited renal tubular disorders. A 27 year old man came to emergency room with weakness and generalised muscle cramps. He was investigated three months before for a similar electrolyte disturbance which was found to be inconclusive. The routine laboratory data in emergency room revealed a potassium concentration of 2.3 mmol/l. He had never used diuretics or hormonal therapy nor had history of vomiting or diarrhea. He had normal blood pressure and the blood gas analysis revealed metabolic alkalosis. On his ECG (electrocardiography), we found the prominent U wave. Despite his low concentration of serum potassium and cloride, the concentration of these electrolytes in urine were extremely high. We also found hipomagnesemia. The calcium concentration in serum was normal with slightly hypocalciuria. Even with aggressive oral and intravenous potassium suplementation, the patient remained hypokalemic. In cases when the etiology of hypokalemia is unclear, we should perform some investigations to confirm the diagnosis and give the proper treatment. In Gitelman's syndrome, where the defect in the distal tubule cannot be corrected, the treatment must be a life-long.

In cancer treatment, applications of pharmacogenetic cover three areas: avoidance of adverse drug reaction (ADR), selection of treatment options, and prediction of cancer recurrence. Patients with genetic variations in UGT1A1 and DPYD genes are hypersensitive to Irinotecan and 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) respectively. Therefore, the chance for the patients to suffer from ADR from using those drugs can be predicted a priori by simple genetic tests. Secondly, the efficacy of targeted therapy drugs such as Cetuximab and Erlotinib, or non- targeted agents such as temozolomide and nitrosourea has been influenced by the presence of certain genetic or epigenetic markers in tumors. Lastly, microarray analysis to evaluate 70-gene expression profile in breast cancer samples has been shown in recent studies to predict probability of breast cancer recurrence. Patients whose tumors have been determined to have low probability score based on the gene expression profile may omit chemotherapy altogether, avoiding unnecessary therapeutic side effects. In summary, pharmacogenetic tests help patients, their caregivers, and doctors in deciding the best treatment options with favorable chance of success, as well as saving overall treatment costs.",,"antineoplastic agent; human; methodology; neoplasm; personalized medicine; pharmacogenetics; review; Antineoplastic Agents; Humans; Individualized Medicine; Neoplasms; Pharmacogenetics","Kristyanto, H.email: hendykris@gmail.com",,,01259326,,,20513938,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953332211

Somatic-Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT), which involves injection of donor cell nucleus into enucleated ovum, is the standard technique for new embryonic stem (ES) cell lines generation; presently its efficiency is low. A newer technique, pluripotent stem cell induction, reprograms somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by introducing certain factors into somatic cells. While certain adult stem cell treatments have been investigated on human participants, most ES cell or iPS cell treatments were still experimented on animal models.

Its potential role in treating cardiovascular disorder was demonstrated as injection of damaged rat heart with human ES cells derived cardiomyocyte plus ""prosurvival"" cocktail improved heart function. It might also treat nervous system disorders; injected into brain, ES cells derived neurons replace some loss cells in stroke rats and iPS cells derived neurons improved Parkinsonian syndrome in rats. Progress was also seen in other aspects of regenerative medicine.

Scleroderma affect approximately 20 new patients per million per year and has an estimated prevalence of approximately 250 patients per million in the United States, the synonyms from this disease including Progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS), or diffuse scleroderma. Scleroderma is a multisystem disorder characterized by skin thickening and vascular abnormalities. Causes of scleroderma remain mysterious. Immunologic abnormalities are suggested by the presence of characteristic autoantibodies such as ANA,anticentromere, and anti-Scl-70 antibodies. In addition to skin, the most commonly affected organs are lung and kidney. Three major diseases subsets are recognized based on the extent of skin disease. Limited disease is defined as skin fibrosis in distal extremities and some areas of face and neck. Limited diseases are also known as CREST syndrome. Diffuse disease includes patients with skin abnormalities extending to the proximal extremities (i.e., above the elbow or knee) and trunk.

Hypertension increases not only the risk for progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) but also for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality.

The optimal target for BP control for most hypertensive patients is < 140/90 mmHg, or < 130/80 mmHg for patients with diabetes and CKD. Certain lifestyle measures such as weight reduction, smoking cessation, restriction of dietary sodium intake, moderation of alcohol intake and an increase in physical activity can lower BP. Except for progression of proteinuric kidney disease and congestive heart failure (CHF), it is the achieved BP and not the class of agent that is most important in reducing morbid outcomes. If BP is more than 20/10 mmHg above the goal, therapy should be initiated with 2 drugs, one of which should be a thiazide-type diuretic. A strong consideration should be given to initiate antihypertensive therapy in patients with (RAAS) blockers, usually in concert with diuretics.

METHODS: The study was conducted by nested case-control method with consecutive samples of asthma patients aged 15-60 years at the outpatient clinic, Department of Pulmonology in Dr. Wahidin Sudirohusodo General Hospital, Makassar. Twenty-eight patients were found irresponsive to terbutaline nebulation (increased FEV1 < 15%) and 56 patients were responsive (increased FEV1 > or =15%). DNA extraction and amplification were performed by PCR as well as polymorphism detection, which was done by automatic sequencing machine. RESULTS: The Arg 16 polymorphism did not have any effect on the response to terbutaline nebulation, but Gln 27 polymorphism did with OR 3.18. New polymorphism was found in nucleotide at 20th order before the start codon, it was T/C -20, which also has an effect on the response to terbutaline nebulation with OR 4.53. When the three polymorphisms were combined, the effect were greater with OR 11.11. It was found that age, gender, obesity, onset and ethnicity had no effect on the response to terbutaline nebulation.

RESULTS: there were 294 male patients (75.2%) and 97 female patients (24.8%), from 25-89 years age group, with mean value 57.35 +/- 11.05. The mean value of total cholesterol level was 205.23 mg/dl +/- 54.84. The LDL cholesterol level was 136.16 mg/dl +/- 47.29. The mean HDL cholesterol level was 42.84 mg/dl +/- 10.28, mean triglycerides level was 157.25 mg/dl +/- 100.16. There were 82 patients (21%) with high total cholesterol (> 240 mg/dl), 102 patients (26.1%) with high and very high LDL cholesterol level (> 160 mg/dl), 152 (38.6%) patients with low HDL cholesterol level (< 40 mg/dl), consisted of 126 male patients or 42.9% of total male patients, 26 female patients or 26.8% of total female patients. The number of patients with high / very high triglycerides level (> 200 mg/dl or 500 mg/dl) was 84 patients (21.5%). The number of patients with optimal lipid level, total cholesterol level < 200 mg/dl was 191 patients (48.8%); 82 patients (21%) had LDL cholesterol level < 100 mg/dl, 23 patients (5.9%) had HDL cholesterol level > 60 mg/dl, 226 patients (57.8%) had triglycerides level < 150 mg/dl. There were 260 patients with atherogenic lipid profile (64%), 135 patients with borderline lipid profile (34.5%), and optimal lipid profile was found only in 6 patients (1,5%). The mean value of HDL cholesterol level in male patients was 41.75 mg/dl +/- 9.9, while HDL cholesterol level in female patients was 46.16 mg/dl +/- 10.74. Principally, lipid profiles of all age groups were evenly distributed. ACS patients with history of family heart disease had a more atherogenic lipid profile compared to lipid profile of patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cigarette smoking. CONCLUSION: atherogenic lipid profile is more common risk factor in ACS patients than in other non-lipid risk factors.

METHODS: In 1997, a population-based screening was performed on a group of government employees and retired subjects in the Makassar Municipality. Since the year 2000, we performed screening at the clinic. For clinical-based screening, we focused the screening on those with high risks for developing diabetes mellitus, i.e. all subjects aged > or =45 or those aged < 45 with one or more of the following abnormalities: obese (BMI > 25 kg/m2), elevated blood pressure (> or =140/90 mmHg in adults), family history of diabetes, previous identified IFG or IGT, HDL-cholesterol < or =35 mg/dl and/or triglyceride > or =250 mg/dL, and history of gestational diabetes mellitus or delivery of babies > or =4000 gram. For population-based screening, the criteria for diabetes mellitus was based on a single test 2-hours post load (75 gram glucose), while for office-based screening, the WHO l999 was used i.e. fasting and 2-hours post 75 gram glucose load (OGTT). RESULTS: During the screening in the population, 941 subjects were screened, 290 women and 651 men. There were 51 diabetic subjects, or a prevalence of 5.42%, 21 women or 7.24% of all women, and 30 men or 4.60% of all men. At the clinical setting, 907 were screened, 483 women and 424 men. Among these subjects, 155 fulfilled the diabetes criteria, with a prevalence of 17.1%. There were 78 diabetic women or 16.1% of all women, and 77 men or 18.2% of all men. If the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in the clinical setting is based only on 2 hours post load (the same as for population-based) only 70 patients can be detected, for a prevalence of 7.7%, which is still higher compared to the results of the population-based screening. All figures obtained from the office-based screening were higher as compared to the population-based results. CONCLUSION: These results show that office-based screening detected more asymptomatic diabetes compared to population-based screening. It is suggested that early detection of asymptomatic diabetes is performed at the clinic, either at the hospital or doctor's private office.",,"high density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adult; age; age distribution; aged; article; blood; diet restriction; female; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance test; human; hypertension; Indonesia; male; mass screening; methodology; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; outpatient department; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; prevalence; primary health care; risk factor; Adult; Age Distribution; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Blood Glucose; Cholesterol, HDL; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetes, Gestational; Fasting; Female; Glucose Tolerance Test; Humans; Hypertension; Indonesia; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Obesity; Pregnancy; Prevalence; Primary Health Care; Risk Factors; Triglycerides","Adam, F.M.",,,01259326,,,16799205,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750689852

METHODS: a random, double-blind-parallel study and repeat measurement against 20 elderly-patients with knee-OA was conducted. Patients were divided into 2 equal groups, every group got piroxicam 20 mg/day or meloxicam 15 mg/day for 3 weeks. On the second group, sukralfat 2 x 1 g/day were given. To examine the difference before and after treatment, we used Wilcoxon signed rank test, to examine the difference within those groups we used Mann-whitney U test, to examine the correlation between endoscopic score and dyspepsia, we used the Spearman correlation test with significant correlation interpretation by Guilford rules. RESULTS: one of piroxicam group was resigned, so that there was 19 person left to complete this study. Piroxicam has caused elevation of endoscopic score in 78% subject compared to the beginning of study, and 22% of the subject has developed ulcers. Alteration of endoscopic feature after administration of this piroxicam was statistically significant (p< 0,05). Mild dyspepsia symptoms after piroxicam administration were positive on 67% subjects (p< 0,05). After administration of meloxicam, 40% subjects have elevated endoscopic score compared to beginning of the study (p< 0,05). Mild dyspepsia symptoms after meloxicam administration were positive on 40% subjects (p> 0,05). Meloxicam has less elevation of endoscopic score compared to the piroxicam (p< 0,05). By statistics, both of groups showed no difference in dyspepsia symptoms (p> 0,05). There was no significant correlation between elevation of endoscopic score and dyspepsia on both of groups. Nevertheless, it tends to have weak positive correlation (piroxicam group r= 0,306, p> 0,05, meloxicam group r= 0,330, p> 0,05). CONCLUSION: on this study, we conclude that the administration of either piroxicam or meloxicam in elderly-patient with knee-OA has caused the gastric mucosa impairment. The impairment after meloxicam administration is milder than piroxicam. There is no significant difference of dyspepsia symptoms in both of groups.

METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed on patients with diabetic ketoacidosis at the Emergency Unit of Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital. All patients that were admitted were had their blood glucose, beta-hydroxybutirate, acetoacetate, pH, pCO2, HCO3, anion gap and consciousness levels serially monitored on upon admittance (0 hour) and the 2nd, 6th, 12th, 18th and 24(th) hours. The correlation coefficient of each examination was also calculated. The benefit of serial examination of each variable was also determined for each ketoacidosis undergoing the study. RESULTS: Out of the 19 available samples, a strong negative correlation was found between beta-hydroxybutirate and pH with a value of r>0.5 (from -0.524 to -0.833 with p<0.05) for 24 hours, compared to acetoacetate with the lowest r of -0.515 to -0.731 lasting up to 12 hours.

Innate and adaptive immunity system triggers an inflammatory process, in which blood pressure may increase, stimulating organ damage. Cells in innate immune system produce ROS, such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, which aimed at killing pathogens. Long-term inflammation process increases ROS production, causing oxidative stress which leads to endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial function is to regulate blood vessel tone and structure. When inflammation lasts, NO bioavailability decreases, disrupting its main function as vasodilator, so that blood vessels relaxation and vasodilatation are absent. Effector T cells and regulatory lymphocytes, part of the adaptive immune system, plays role in blood vessels constriction in hypertension. Signals from central nervous system and APC activates effector T lymphocyte differentiation and accelerate through Th-1 and Th-17 phenotypes. Th-1 and Th-17 effectors participate in inflammation which leads to increased blood pressure. One part of CD4+ is the regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppress immune response activation as they produce immunosuppressive cytokines, such as TGF-β and IL-10. Adoptive transfer of Tregs cells can reduce oxidative stress in blood vessels, endothelial dysfunction, infiltration of aortic macrophages and T cells as well as proinflammatory cytokine levels in plasma circulation.","endothelial dysfunction; hypertension; Immune system activation; inflamation process","cytokine; adaptive immunity; blood; human; hypertension; inflammation; innate immunity; oxidative stress; pathophysiology; physiology; T lymphocyte; Adaptive Immunity; Cytokines; Humans; Hypertension; Immunity, Innate; Inflammation; Oxidative Stress; T-Lymphocytes",,,,01259326,,,28790231,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034828158

During the last two decades, there has been no study of developing antibiotics in search of discovering new type of antibiotics; meanwhile, the resistance of Gram-negative bacteria or MDRO to antibiotics is increasing. Colistin or polymyxin E is an old antibiotic, which has been used since 1959 for treating infection caused by Gram-negative MDRO. It was revealed that colistin has side effects of nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity; therefore, the use of this antibiotic was stopped and it was replaced by other antibiotics which were effective and were considered safer at that time. There is an increasing number of infections with multi-resistant Gram-negative (MDRO) against the available antibiotics and the availability of alternative antibiotics has not been satisfying; therefore, microbiologists are searching back to the old option, which has been proven to be effective against multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, the old antibiotic that has been long forgotten, i.e. colistin, as an alternative treatment against Gram-negative MDRO.

The mean of the correct answers to the knowledge questions was 44%; of the answers to the attitude questions 67% were in agreement with the correct attitude; obstacles to compliance with infection control guidelines were perceived in 30% of the questions and the mean self-reported compliance was 63%. Safe handling of sharps, hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment were identified as the most important aspects for interventions. Significant positive correlations were found between knowledge, attitude, self-reported behaviour and perceived obstacles. the questionnaire in conjunction with site visits and interviews was a valuable strategy to identify trouble spots in the hospitals and to determine barriers to facilitators of change that should be taken into account when planning interventions. Successful interventions should cover hospital management, the infection control team, as well as the health care workers on the wards.",,"article; attitude to health; hand washing; health care personnel; health personnel attitude; hepatitis B; human; Indonesia; infection control; needlestick injury; practice guideline; protective equipment; psychological aspect; questionnaire; standard; statistics; vaccination; Attitude of Health Personnel; Guideline Adherence; Hand Hygiene; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Hepatitis B; Humans; Indonesia; Infection Control; Needlestick Injuries; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Protective Devices; Questionnaires; Vaccination","Duerink, D.O.",,,01259326,,,24045391,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900587678

The samples were collected in tubes that contained ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) for DNA analysis. The DNA was extracted from leukocytes according to the standard DNAzol® Extraction Protocol. Samples were stored at -80°C until the analysis. Template DNA was then amplified by using a pair of sense oligonucleotide primer of 5'-CTGG AGACC ACTCCCATCCTTTCT-3' and antisense primer 5'-GATGGTGGCCATCAC ATTCGTC AGAT-3', 10 pmol of each primer. The PCR mixture contained 20 ng of genomic DNA, 3 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.4, 5% dimethyl-sulphoxide (DMSO), each of 0,5 mM deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTPs) and 1 unit of Taq polymerase in a final volume of 50 μL. The DNA was amplified by 30 cycles; denaturation at 940C for 1 min, annealing at 580C for 1 min, and extension at 720C for 2 min, followed by a final extension at 720C for 4 min by using PCR Thermal (Icycler, Biorad, USA). PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarosa gel, and identified by ethidium bromide (0.1%) staining, and finally visualized by ultraviolet light. They were documented by using the geldoc (Biorad, USA). The PCR product is a 190 bp fragment in the absence of insertion (D) and a 490 bp fragment in the presence of insertion (I). ischemic stroke with hypertension or with the history of hypertension was found more frequently in male (70%) and ≥ 55 year old subjects (60.0%). The study showed that the frequency of II genotype was higher than DI and DD. Moreover, the frequency of I allele was higher than D allele. In healthy normotensive group, the results remained the same. However, different results were found in infarct-stroke group with hypertension history in which the frequency of DI genotype was higher than in II genotype and the DD. The study showed that there was no significant correlation (p=0.188) between ACE gene polymorphism and infarct stroke in subjects with the history of hypertension. ACE gene just has approximately 5% role in developing ischemic stroke. there is no significant correlation between ACE gene polymorphism and the development of ischemic stroke in patients with history of hypertension of the population in Palembang.

ACPE is defined as pulmonary edema with increased secondary hydrostatic capillary pressure due to elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Increased hydrostatic pressure may result from various causes including excessive administration of intravascular volume, obstruction of pulmonary venous outflow or secondary left ventricular failure due to left ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction. ACPE must be distinguished from pulmonary edema associated with injury of alveolar capillary membrane caused by various etiologies, i.e. direct pulmonary injury such as pneumonia and indirect pulmonary injury such as sepsis. Numerous clinical manifestations may differentiate ACPE and Non-ACPE. ACPE usually presents with a history of acute cardiac catastrophe. Physical examination reveals a low-flow state, S3 gallop, jugular venous distention and fine crepitant rales with auscultation. The diagnosis of pulmonary edema is made based on symptoms and clinical signs are found through history taking, physical examination, ECG, chest X-ray, echocardiography and laboratory tests including blood gas analysis and specific biomarkers. Medical treatment of ACPE has 3 main objectives, i.e.: (1) reduced venous return (preload reduction); (2) reduced resistance of systemic vascular (afterload reduction); and (3) inotropic support in some cases.

Advanced knowledge in genetics and epigenetics of colorectal cancer develops a hypothesis that various clinical manifestations of colorectal cancer are caused by different carcinogenesis pathways. Different carcinogenesis pathways and types of colorectal cancer appear to bring effects on different response against chemotherapy and prognosis. Chemotherapy is mainly provided for patients with stage III CRC which are also the largest proportion of CRC patients in Indonesia. However, it is also provided for some patients with high risk stage II CRC. Classically, clinical factors have been generally accepted as prognostic factors including depth of tumor invasion, regional nodal metastasis, vascular invasion, poor differentiation, and serologic tumor marker such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). However, clinical and histopathological factors themselves do not provide accurate prediction for colorectal cancer prognosis and treatment. A biomolecular marker is necessary to provide such prediction. Numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the molecular biological markers in order to determine either the possibility of successful treatment for colorectal cancer (predictive factor) or life-expectancy (prognostic factor). Results of several studies demonstrate different status of some molecular markers to determine successful treatment between stage II and stage III colorectal cancer. Certainly, such finding should be followed up but it shall be accepted that there will be a shift of paradigm of CRC treatment. Therefore, the success of colorectal cancer, excluding the patient's socioeconomic factors and the surgeon's skill, will depend extremely on molecular parameter and not only the stage.",,"tumor marker; adjuvant chemotherapy; cancer staging; colorectal tumor; genetic marker; human; microsatellite instability; mutation; pathology; patient selection; prediction and forecasting; prognosis; review; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Colorectal Neoplasms; Genetic Markers; Humans; Microsatellite Instability; Mutation; Neoplasm Staging; Patient Selection; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Tumor Markers, Biological","Sudoyo, A.W.email: arusudoyo@gmail.com",,,01259326,,,20737746,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957266362

This study also aimed to test the hypothesis that systemic chronic hypoxia may cause heart failure. METHODS: Although clinical use of BNP as a biomarker in heart failure is increasing, the specificity of BNP for heart failure is not robust, suggesting that other mechanisms beyond simple ventricular stretch stimulate BNP release. Plasma BNP levels were markedly increased in patients with coronary artery disease but without concomitant left ventricular dysfunction. Thus, elevated BNP levels do not necessarily reflect heart failure but may also result from cardiac ischemia. Sprague-Dawley male rats, weighing 220-250 g at the time of recruitment were randomly divided into 7 groups (n = 4 per group), the control normoxia group was exposed to room air, while the hypoxia group were caged in a plexiglass hypoxic chamber (8%O2 and 92% N2) for 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days, respectively. RESULTS: Our data clearly showed that plasma BNP-45 and ventricular BNP-45 mRNA concentration were markedly increased which reached its peak on day 21 after treatment.

METHODS: subjects were 127 patients on maintenance haemodialysis: 46 with DM and 81 without. Vascular calcification of the aortic arch and peripheral artery were recorded qualitatively using x-ray of the chest and lower extremities. Clinical characteristics and laboratory values were taken from the medical records. RESULTS: the overall prevalence of vascular calcification was similar in our haemodialysis patients, with or without DM (26.1% vs 25.9%). The diabetic patients were in general of older age (58.5+10.3 vs 51.6+12.6 years, p<0.05), had lower diastolic BP (80+14 vs 86+14 mmHg, p<0.05), and higher prevalence of isolated peripheral artery calcification (13% vs 2.5%, p<0.05).

METHODS: this was a cross-sectional, comparative study of female breast cancer patients who were recruited and divided into two age groups, i.e. 35 years or younger and more than 35 years old. Specimens were obtained by biopsy or surgical removal of the tumors and were confirmed by histopathological examination. The expression of ER, IGF-1R, Her-2, MAPK, and cyclin D1 were measured using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: ninety-three patients were recruited from September 2004 to December 2005. Forty-three patients were 35 years or younger. More than 90% of the patients within the two groups showed invasive ductal carcinomas and more than half of these tumors were grade 2.

Patient's satisfaction level was higher in CGA group (193.38 [1.25] vs 177.47 [3.04]; p=0.00).Nurse satisfaction level was also higher in CGA group than non-CGA group but not statistically significant (225.06[7.08] vs 220.06[8.26]; p=0.65).Mean of healthcare cost in non-CGA group was higher than in CGA group (Rp. 9,746,426.00 [1,180,331] vs Rp 4,760,965.00 [338,089]). Cost effectiveness analysis indicated that CGA was superior to conventional approach because for each point score of QALD's, total cost was lower in geriatric acute care unit than in conventional ward(Rp 418,199.00 vs Rp 628,695.00). Moreover, QALD's in CGA group was better than in non-CGA group (24.1 vs 22.8; p= 0.03). CONCLUSION: the CGA approach is more cost effective compared to conventional approach. Quality adjusted life days are better in CGA group than in non-CGA group although survival is not statistically different. In CGA group, length of hospitalization was shorter, functional status and patient satisfaction is better in general. Working satisfaction of nurses in CGA group was not lower than in non CGA group.",,"aged; article; case control study; cost benefit analysis; economics; elderly care; evaluation; female; geriatric assessment; health care; health care cost; health care quality; human; length of stay; male; methodology; middle aged; outcome assessment; patient satisfaction; quality adjusted life year; questionnaire; statistics; survival; utilization review; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Case-Control Studies; Comprehensive Health Care; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Geriatric Assessment; Health Care Costs; Health Services for the Aged; Humans; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Patient Satisfaction; Program Evaluation; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Questionnaires; Survival Analysis","Soejono, C.H.email: geriatri_fkuirscm@yahoo.com",,,01259326,,,19054877,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58749111096

METHODS: The study was cross sectional on 64 post-menopausal women without secondary risk factor for osteoporosis. They were classified proportionally using the Singh index. Bone density was measured using DEXA (dual x-ray absorptiometry) on the femoral neck and lumbal 2-4 spine areas. The Singh index and cortical index of the femoral neck were evaluated using femoral neck antero-posterior x-ray. Physical activities were measured using a Historical leisure activity questionnaire. Bivariat statistical analysis was conducted using the t-test and chi-square, whereas multivariate analysis was conducted using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: There was a significant association (p<0.05) between bone density and age, body weight, height, body mass index, duration of menopause and Singh index. With multinomial logistic regression analysis, it was demonstrated that only Singh index, the duration of menopause and body mass index had the highest sensitivity and specificity. The score system algorithm could be utilized in two steps, the first was to diagnose osteoporosis and the second was to distinguish between osteopenia and normal bone. This score system had a sensitivity of 91.4% and a specificity of 89.6%, a positive prediction value of 91.4% in determining osteoporosis, and a sensitivity of 66.7%, a specificity of 89.1% and a positive prediction value of 70.6% in determining osteopenia, whereas the negative prediction value was 75%.

Sample was taken by consecutive sampling method. Diagnostic criteria of NAFLD were confirmed by liver biopsy. Clinical variables include metabolic syndrome, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), adiponectine, TNF-, insulin, homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index and liver biopsy. Patients were divided into two groups based on their liver biopsy, group 1: Non-NASH (NAFLD activity score <3) and group 2: NASH (NAFLD activity score of >4). Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t-test, Mann Whitney U, chi-square, the ROC curve, sensitivity and specificity test.RESULTS: fifty NAFLD patients were recruited, 30 males and 20 females. Among these patients, 12 (24%) had type 2 diabetes, 36 (72%) had metabolic syndrome, the remaining 2 (4%) did not fulfilled metabolic syndrome. Liver biopsy confirmed 21 (42%) non- NASH and 29 (58%) NASH respectively. Level of AST and ALT, plasma level of adiponectine and TNF- were statistically different between two groups. The AST level (>25 U/L) in combination with TNF- (>3.28 pg/cc) demonstrated a good diagnostic accuracy for NASH (Accuracy 82%, Sensitivity 76%, Specificity 90%, PPV 92%, and NPV 73%).CONCLUSION: the combined diagnostic tests of AST and TNF- plasma levels demonstrated a good accuracy for the detection of NASH among NAFLD patients.

Multicenter study of adult CHB patients requiring oral antiviral therapy in daily practice setting. All patients received 600 mg of telbivudine daily for one year. Recruitment and decision to start telbivudine therapy was based on clinical indication as assessed by the participating physicians. The primary end-point was patient safety (adverse event or serious adverse events); while the secondary end-points were HBeAg seroconversion, changes of serum HBV DNA levels and serum ALT normalization. Patients were assessed at week-24 and week-52 of treatment.RESULTS: a total of 176 cases were eligible for analysis, comprising 104 (59.8%) HBeAg-positive and 70 (40.2%) HBeAg-negative patients. Adverse events were reported in 7 (4.0%) patients, most of them were mild. HBeAg loss and seroconversion rate was 28.8% and 14.14% at week-52 respectively. Undetectable HBV DNA (PCR negativity) was 51.8% at week-24 and 62.7% at week-52. Median HBV DNA levels were significantly reduced from baseline to week-24 and week-52 treatment (both p<0.001; Wilcoxon's signed-rank test). Normalization of serum ALT activity occurred in 85 (73.28%) patients at week-52.CONCLUSION: Telbivudine therapy is generally safe and well tolerated among adult Indonesian patients with chronic hepatitis B.

The 2 major components of managing respiratory failure are the acute intervention and the weaning process. Many of the studies to determine the optimal methods of ventilation and weaning have focused on non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation as an alternative to invasive ventilation, with various causes of acute respiratory failure. Non-invasive ventilation refers to the provision of ventilatory support to the lungs, without the use of an endotracheal airway. It has emerged as an important tool in the treatment of acute respiratory failure. Non-invasive positive ventilation has undergone a remarkable evolution over the past decades and is assuming an important role in the management of both acute and chronic respiratory failure. There is improvement in gas exchange, relief of respiratory muscle fatigue, and clinical outcome with reduced morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, contraindications and failures need to be identified early, as delaying endotracheal intubation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, although it is common practice to give intubation and mechanical ventilation, complications can result from the intubation process (damage to local tissue) and during the course of ventilation (pneumonia and sinusitis associated with ventilators), prolonging stay in intensive care, length of hospital stay and mortality in selected patients.",,"acute disease; hemodynamics; human; lung ventilation; noninvasive ventilation; patient selection; positive end expiratory pressure; procedures; Respiratory Insufficiency; Acute Disease; Hemodynamics; Humans; Noninvasive Ventilation; Patient Selection; Positive-Pressure Respiration; Pulmonary Ventilation; Respiratory Insufficiency",,,,01259326,,,24760814,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84910653951

Oseltamivir is an antiviral drug that was developed for the treatment of influenza infections. Disease surveillance and research suggests that seasonal influenza (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 or B) results in considerable morbidity and mortality in Indonesia, where over 15% of influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory illness patients test positive for the influenza virus. Indonesia currently limits oseltamivir for the management of avian influenza A/H5N1cases and in anticipation of a pandemic triggered by the A/H5N1 virus. We present the evidence for the use of oseltamivir in the treatment of seasonal influenza infections so that doctors have the option to prescribe the drug.

Parapneumonic effusions account for approximately one-third of all effusions, and about 40% of patients with pneumonia develop a concomitant effusion. Patients with pneumonia who develop an effusion have an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Some of the excess mortality is due to mismanagement of the parapneumonic effusion. Bacterial and white cell metabolism can rapidly turn a simple exudative parapneumonic effusion into a multiloculated purulent empyema with low pH and high lactate dehydrogenase levels. The optimal approach to treating parapneumonic effusions and pleural empyemas remains controversial. Accepted management consists of systemic antibiotics and drainage of the pleural cavity, which is achieved by either medical chest tube drainage or surgery. Several investigators have studied the efficacy and safety of intrapleural fibrinolytics in the treatment of pleural effusion and empyema. Intrapleural instillation of fibrinolytic agents is undertaken to dissolve fibrinous clots and membranes, to prevent fluid sequestration, and hence to improve drainage. Recombinant deoxyribonuclease has been reported to improve drainage in a single patient who did not respond to fibrinolytic therapy.",,"fibrinolytic agent; human; pleura effusion; pleura empyema; pneumonia; review; Empyema, Pleural; Fibrinolytic Agents; Humans; Pleural Effusion; Pneumonia","Singh, G.",,,01259326,,,22983084,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875057272

The large response variability of certain drugs with narrow margin of safety may induce toxicity. To avoid this and to optimize the result of drug treatment, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) service has been routinely applied in hospitals in well-developed countries. For certain drugs, the TDM service has been shown beneficial and cost-effective. In Indonesia, the TDM has not yet been implemented. There are three problems that hamper the implementation of TDM here, i.e. cost, the limited expertise to provide interpretation for result of drug assay, and the lack of communication with the clinicians. Today the patient safety issue is considered of paramount importance in the health care service in all hospitals. Therefore, it is now the time to commence the TDM service in Indonesia. This can be started with a pilot project in a large hospital, followed by the others. To avoid unnecesary wasting of funds, TDM should be limited for drugs which toxicity is not readily observed clinically.",,"article; clinical competence; developing country; drug monitoring; drug therapy; economics; human; Indonesia; interdisciplinary communication; methodology; pharmacokinetics; pharmacology; Clinical Competence; Developing Countries; Drug Monitoring; Drug Therapy; Humans; Indonesia; Interdisciplinary Communication; Pharmacokinetics; Pharmacological Phenomena","Setiabudy, R.email: rianto_set@yahoo.com",,,01259326,,,21979288,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857082065

Prediabetes was based on PERKENI criteria. Subject with fasting blood glucose less than 126 mg/dL and 2-hours blood glucose less than 200 mg/dL met the criteria. Laboratory test of HbA1c and ADMA plasma were performed. To asses brachial FMD, the left brachial artery diameter was measured both at rest and during reactive hyperemia. Increased flow was induced by inflation of pneumatic tourniquet around the forearm to a pressure of 50 mm Hg upper systolic pressure for 5 minutes, followed by release. Measurements of arterial diameter were performed at end diastole at rest and 60 seconds after cuff release. The vessel diameter in scans after reactive hyperemia was expressed as the percentage relative to resting scan (100%). All ultrasound scans were analyzed by a single reader. from 41 prediabetes subjects could be found correlation between ADMA serum with 2-hours post prandial blood glucose (p 0,003 and r 0,457) and HbA1c (p <0,001 and r 0,720). We also found correlation between FMD value with 2-hours post prandial blood glucose (p 0,01 and r -0.487) and HbA1c (p <0,001 and r -0.763). Besides that, there was correlation between ADMA serum with FMD value (p <0,001 and r -0,617).

The nature of the Indonesian HIV epidemic (increasing overall prevalence, with different epidemic profiles); the characteristics of the Indonesian health system (decentralized policy making, low and inequitable funding), and the low and highly internationalized funding of HIV/AIDS control (resulting in low service coverage and questions of sustainability) draw out a very specific health environment of HIV/AIDS.

Key behaviors to HIV prevention and care are determined by a complex set of individual/ environmental factors. This paper presents empirical data, local evidence and theoretical concepts to determine the role of social sciences in HIV prevention/care. Injecting Drug Use (IDU) is a social and very risky activity: 95% injected in the presence of peers and 49% reported needles sharing. 82% of IDUs do not use condoms consistently. Poor adherence to ARV treatment is related to a complex set of, mostly behavioral, factors beyond effective influence by standard professional skills of medical staff.

We compare blood glucose level between isoflurane and desflurane in neurosurgical patients for further application. METHODS: One hundred and eight patients scheduled for neurosurgery under general anesthesia were recruited and divided into two groups; fentanyl-isoflurane-nitrous oxide based and fentanyl-desflurane-nitrous oxide based randomly. Vital signs, end tidal gas concentration, amount of narcotics usage and blood glucose level were recorded at induction (T0) and intraoperative hourly thereafter (T1-T8). Independent t-test and ANOVA were used. The statistical significance was considered if p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: There were 107 patients enrolled excluded one from isoflurane group because of the schedule changes. The amounts of fentanyl usage (0.89+/-0.41 mcg/kg/hr, 0.88+/-0.48 mcg/kg/hr), the end tidal inhales' tension (0.71%+/-0.32, 3.13%+/-1.63) were equivalent in isoflurane and desflurane group.

Forty-two postmenopausal osteoporotic patients aged 51-77 years old who had been postmenopausal for 5-28 years were included in this study. Vitamin D inadequacy was defined as the plasma levels of 25(OH)D less than 50 nmol/L whereas hyperparathyroidism was defined as the PTH level more than 69 pg/dL. RESULTS: vitamin D inadequacy was found in 61.9% of patients and 34.6% of them or 23.8% of total patients were also having high PTH level. There was an inverse correlation between 25(OH)D with PTH levels and positive correlation between duration of menopause and PTH level. Vitamin D inadequacy is common (61.9%) in postmenopausal osteoporotic patients who visited Rheumatology outpatient clinic of Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital Jakarta. CONCLUSION: the low concentration of 25(OH)D was correlated with PTH level and duration of menopause. This finding should be confirmed in a larger epidemiological study, either hospital-or community-based to assess vitamin D status among postmenopausal women in Indonesia.",,"calcium; parathyroid hormone; vitamin D; aged; article; blood; cross-sectional study; female; human; hyperparathyroidism; Indonesia; middle aged; nutritional status; postmenopause osteoporosis; risk factor; Aged; Calcium; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Hyperparathyroidism; Indonesia; Middle Aged; Nutritional Status; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal; Parathyroid Hormone; Risk Factors; Vitamin D","Sarmidi, S.",,,01259326,,,18560026,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-59849127943

We report a case, a Russian male, 35 years old, who was rushed to the Gleneagles Hospital Medan from the airport after being evacuated from Banda Aceh together with another older Russian who died as they arrived at the admission and Emergency Department. From the result of intensive allo anamnesis and the high anion gap metabolic acidosis, in the absence of disturbed renal and liver function, we presumed this patient was suffering from methanol intoxication. The time of exposure was approximately 70 hours before. The exact length of dialysis time to excrete the noxious substance from the blood without plasma methanol determination was difficult. Moreover the time elapsed from exposure to treatment had been approximately 70 hours, which means the optic nerve had been so long exposed to formic acid, the toxic metabolite of methanol, that the damage should have been very severe. Ethanol is also known to be an antidote of methanol, which can be given orally by nasogastric tube, or i.v. It should be given early, and plasma ethanol level should be closely monitored to make it effective and safe. This was also unavailable. Another antidote is fomepizole which is also as yet unavailable in Medan.

METHODS: this is an experimental study which examined the expression of TNFa, IL-1b, IL-8, adhesion molecule of VCAM-1 and the development of foam cells associated with atherosclerotic process in white-rats' aorta. There were 32 male rats, +/- 6 weeks of age, divided into 4 groups: control group (K) without infection, and 3 groups with infection through nasal and oral inoculation of Chlamydia pneumoniae by single dose of 5 x 105 in amount of 35 microl. The first group (P1) was preserved for 5(1/2) months period, the second group (P2) was preserved for 7(1/2) months and the third group (P3) was preserved for 9(1/2) months. At the end of study, histological slides were made from aortic tissues in order to study the development of atherosclerotic process by examining foam cells and cytokines expression of TNFa, IL-1b, IL-8 and VCAM-1. Foam cells examination was performed by Hematoxcillin-eosin staining, while indirect immunohistochemistry staining was used to examine the expression of TNFa, IL-1b, IL-8 and VCAM-1. Afterward, the amount of foam cells and cytokines expression was measured. The study result was analyzed by ANOVA. RESULTS: there was increased expression of TNFa, IL-1b, IL-8, VCAM-1and increased foam cells formation (extended atherosclerosis area) in the aortic tissues infected by Chlamydia pneumoniae (5(1/2) months, 7(1/2) months and 9(1/2) months), which was significantly different compared to the control group. The result of ANOVA revealed that the most important factor in tissue injury is foam cells development induced by VCAM-1 and IL-8 in all of phases (characterized by most abundant neutrophil infiltration). It indicated the infection caused by extracellular pathogenic agent, which established the fatty streak (acute phase) in 5(1/2) months period. In the group with 7(1/2) months infection period, TNFa also had important roles (characterized by increased monocytes and lymphocytes infiltration), indicating that there was negative-gram pathogenic agent with intracellular infection, which caused a progressive atherosclerotic process, and development of fibrosis / atherosclerotic plaque (sub acute phase). In 9(1/2) months infection period, there was large thrombus containing a lot of leukocytes in the aorta (chronic phase). CONCLUSION: based on the result of this study, it may be concluded that Chlamydia pneumoniae may cause atherosclerotic process in aorta. Extracellular infection of Chlamydia pneumoniae occurs in all of phases and intracellular infection begins in sub-acute phase. On 5(1/2) months period, fatty streak is developed (acute phase); on 7(1/2) months period, there is atherosclerotic plaque (sub acute phase); and on 9(1/2) period, there is large thrombus containing a lot of leukocytes (a progressive chronic phase).",,"interleukin 1beta; interleukin 8; tumor necrosis factor alpha; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; animal; aorta; article; atherosclerosis; bacterial infection; biosynthesis; Chlamydophila pneumoniae; chronic disease; disease course; disease model; immunohistochemistry; immunology; isolation and purification; lymphocyte; male; metabolism; pathology; rat; vascular endothelium; Animals; Aorta; Atherosclerosis; Chlamydophila Infections; Chlamydophila pneumoniae; Chronic Disease; Disease Models, Animal; Disease Progression; Endothelium, Vascular; Immunohistochemistry; Interleukin-1beta; Interleukin-8; Lymphocytes; Male; Rats; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1","Aziz, A.",,,01259326,,,17132885,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-39049191594

METHODS: A study on 81 patients who were on hemodialysis twice a week, 5 hours each session has been conducted. The subjects had no other co-morbidities and all of them used reprocessed diacetate cellulose dialyzers. RESULTS: It was obtained that CRP blood level (6.23+/- 5.57 mg/L), inflammation prevalence (23.5%), and malnutrition inflammation score (6.7) were lower compared with the data from Europe and the United States. Out of 64 patients examined, IL-6-174GG 95.31%, CC 3.13% and GC 1.56%, IL-1082AA 89.06%, GA 10.94%, but absence of GG genotype. Considering the scanty amount of allele C in IL-6-174 gene and G allele in IL-10-1082 gene, based on the statistic analysis performed, it did not reveal the influence of the difference in allele on the clinical manifestation. The proportion of these alleles were almost similar to that obtained in Korea, Japan and China, but it was different from that obtained in the US and in Europe. A very resolute impression was obtained in HD patients in Jakarta that IL-6-174GG gene was protective in nature whereas IL-10-1082 AA gene had a less considerable role.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study using medical record data of all leptospirosis cases admitted to Cipto Mangunkusumo and Persahabatan General Hospitals between January 1993 and December 1996. Patient identification included age, sex, and occupation. Clinical symptoms were described in details and followed by laboratory testing i.e. peripheral blood count, urinalysis, blood urea and creatinine, liver function test, and pancreatic enzymes assay. RESULTS: Seventy-five percent were men and the mean age was 38.3 years old. Sixty out of 68 (88.2%) patients had ARF as defined by an increase of plasma creatinine level of >1.5 mg/mL. The most common presenting symptoms in patients with ARF were fever (100%), nausea and vomiting (95.0%), muscle pain (88.1%) and jaundice (71.3%). The mean duration of fever 7.2 days. The most frequent laboratory abnormalities were increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (100%), leukocytosis (90%) and increase total bilirubin level (87.5%). Only leukocytosis showed a significant difference between ARF and non-ARF patients (p=0,014). Leptospira bataviae was found in 95.6% of patients and 96.7% of ARF patients. Penicillin was given to 80.9% of patients with only 2 (2.9%) deaths. CONCLUSION: Although significant correlation cannot be established, we concluded that nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, jaundice, increased ESR and total bilirubin level should alert the physician about the possibility of renal involvement in leptospirosis patients with prolonged fever. Leptospira bataviae was an important virulent pathogen.

This study aimed to identify the difference on the profile of diabetic patients with and without NAFLD as well as the degree of fibrosis.METHODS: the study was conducted using a cross-sectional method in type-2 diabetic patients who were treated at the outpatient clinic of endocrinology and metabolic division in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. Sampling was done consecutively. Collected data comprised of age, duration of diabetes, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, HDL, triglyceride, and HbA1C levels. Abdominal ultrasonography was conducted for all patients to determine the presence of NAFLD. Patients with NAFLD were subsequently underwent transient elastography in order to assess their degree of liver fibrosis. Chi-square or Fisher's-Exact tests were used for bivariate analysis and logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis.RESULTS: as many as 186 patients were analyzed in the study and 84 patients (45.2%) were demonstrated to have NAFLD.

One of the most common complications of DM is diabetic neuropathy. There are many studies exploring corneal sensitivity as a potential marker of diabetic neuropathy. This review aims to explore association between corneal sensitivity and diabetic neuropathy. In diabetic neuropathy, corneal sensitivity is impaired due to low level of corneal nerve trophic factors, impaired sensory nerve fibers, and lost communication of dendtritic cell. In diabetic patients, this condition can be assessed by several techniques, such as Cochet Bonnet aesthesiometry, non-contact corneal aesthesiometry, and confocal microscopy. Few promising therapeutic targets for impaired corneal sensitivity include stem cell and growth factor therapy that can be used to prevent complication in patient with diabetic neurotrophic keratopathy. Impaired corneal sensitivity serve as a potential marker of diabetic neuropathy. Doctors, opthalmologists and internists, should anticipate the possibility of observing the following changes in diabetic patients with neuropathy by using corneal sensitivity assessment test.","assessment test; corneal sensitivity; diabetes mellitus; diabetic neuropathy","cornea; devices; diabetic neuropathy; human; innervation; pathophysiology; perceptive threshold; physiology; visual system examination; Cornea; Diabetic Neuropathies; Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological; Humans; Sensory Thresholds",,,,01259326,,,28790232,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041272790

Also, there is lack of data regarding the utilization of ARFI in our population. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of ARFI as an alternative noninvasive modality for fibrosis staging in chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C patients in our population.METHODS: we conducted cross-sectional comparison of ARFI imaging and transient elastography on patients who underwent liver biopsy at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. Fibrosis staging using METAVIR scoring system presented as standard reference. A total of 43 patients underwent liver biopsy was evaluated by ARFI imaging and transient elastography. Cut-off values were determined using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC).RESULTS: both liver stiffness determined by ARFI and transient elastography (TE) were moderately correlated with METAVIR score with value of 0.581 and 0.613, respectively (both P<0.01). Diagnostic accuracy of ARFI predicted significant fibrosis (F≥2) with area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.773 (95% CI 0.616-0.930) and even better for cirrhosis (F4 fibrosis), expressed as AUROC of 0.856 (95% CI 0.736-0.975).

Compelling experimental data suggest that shifting the Treg/Teff balance toward Tregs may be a possible therapeutic approach for atherosclerotic disease, although the role of Tregs in human atherosclerotic disease has not been fully elucidated. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the roles of Tregs and Teffs in experimental atherosclerosis, as well as human coronary artery disease.","Atherosclerosis; inflammation; regulatory T cells","animal; atherosclerosis; human; immunology; inflammation; mouse; regulatory T lymphocyte; Animals; Atherosclerosis; Humans; Inflammation; Mice; T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory",,,,01259326,,,28450656,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042671677

There were 9 cases with age of 14 to 18 years and 9 cases with age of more than 18 years where the oldest case was 46 years old. Two cases were male and 16 cases were female. Prior to procedures, clinical assessment, ECG, chest x-ray and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) were performed to confirm the diagnosis of PDA. The procedures of device implantation was performed under conscious sedation in adults and using general anesthesia in adolescents.The size of PDA ranged from 1.6 mm to 11.1 mm. Based on Kritchenko classification, the type of PDA were 15 type A1 and 3type A2. Flow ratio between pulmonary to systemic circulation was between 1.1 and 5.9. The procedure time ranged from 60-189 minutes and the fluoroscopic time 7.1-77.3 minutes. The PA pressure ranged from 22 to 63 mmHg. Immediate results after procedures as seen in angiography showed complete closure in 14 cases and smoky residual shunt or minimal residual shunts in 4 cases, which probably due to the temporary leaking through the devices. In 24 hours, complete closure was achieved in all cases (100%) and continued until 1months. At 6 month follow up, there was no residual shunts detected and also there was no significant complications, such as device embolization or recanalization. This case series suggest that transcatheter closure of PDA in adolescents and adults using Amplatzer duct occluder (ADO) is effective and has excellent resultswithout significant complication.

In developed countries, LBW is commonly caused by preterm birth; while in developing countries, it is mostly due to intrauterine growth retardation. The concept of developmental origins of adult diseases, particularly on late-onset diseases such as hypertension and kidney disease, implies that there is a correlation between intrauterine milieu, intrauterine growth retardation, premature birth and infant feeding. The 'fetal origin hypothesis' suggests that metabolic diseases are directly related to poor nutritional status in early life.There is an inverse association between LBW and later risk of hypertension. The pathomechanism that links LBW and hypertension is multifactorial including delayed nephrogenesis, genetic factors, sympathetic hyperactivity, endothel dysfunction, elastin deficiencies, insulin resistance and activation of renin-angiotension system.","Hypertension; Intra-uterine growth retardation","adult; female; human; hypertension; intrauterine growth retardation; low birth weight; newborn; pregnancy; risk factor; Adult; Female; Fetal Growth Retardation; Humans; Hypertension; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Pregnancy; Risk Factors",,,,01259326,,,28143994,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011976727

Central to this process is the endogenous mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), which coordinates the repair response by recruiting other host cells and secreting growth factors and matrix proteins. MSCs are self-renewing multipotent stem cells that can differentiate into various lineages of mesenchymal origin such as bone, cartilage, tendon, and fat. In addition to multilineage differentiation capacity, MSCs regulate immune response and inflammation and possess powerful tissue protective and reparative mechanisms, making these cells attractive for treatment of different diseases. The beneficial effect of exogenous MSCs on wound healing was observed in a variety of animal models and in reported clinical cases. Specifically, they have been successfully used to treat chronic wounds and stimulate stalled healing processes. Recent studies revealed that human placental membranes are a rich source of MSCs for tissue regeneration and repair. This review provides a concise summary of current knowledge of biological properties of MSCs and describes the use of MSCs for wound healing. In particular, the scope of this review focuses on the role MSCs have in each phase of the wound-healing process, and clinical reports transplatation MSCs - secretomes in chronical ulcer.","chronical ulcer; mesenchymal stem cells; secretomes; tissue regeneration","adult; case report; cytology; Fissure in Ano; human; male; mesenchymal stem cell transplantation; mesenchymal stroma cell; physiology; wound healing; Adult; Fissure in Ano; Humans; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation; Mesenchymal Stromal Cells; Wound Healing",,,,01259326,,,27840356,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011584177

The total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglyceride (TG), were measured and AIP value was determined as log10.[TG:HDL]). Based on AIP value, subjects were allocated into low AIP (<0.24) and high AIP (0.24). The outcome of the study was major adverse cardiovascular events during hospitalization, i.e. multipart of all cause mortality, acute heart failure, cardiogenic shock, reinfarction, and rescucitated VT/VF.RESULTS: among 277 subjects, the high AIP group comprised 213 subjects (77%) and low AIP group comprised 64 subjects (33%). During intensive hospitalisation, 66 subjects (24%) developed MACE and 20 subjects (7%) developed fatal outcome (all cause mortality). The incidence of MACE tended to be higher in low AIP group, however its difference was not significant. The incidence of all cause mortality was significantly higher in low AIP group (14%) than in high AIP group (5%). Multivariable analysis showed that low AIP predicted all cause mortality independently with a risk ratio 3.71 (95% CI 1.26-10.97, p=0.02).CONCLUSION: low AIP value (<0.24) is an independent predictor for all cause mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing intensive hospitalisation.",,"high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; acute disease; aged; atherosclerosis; blood; complication; female; heart infarction; hospitalization; human; incidence; male; middle aged; mortality; prognosis; prospective study; risk factor; statistical model; Acute Disease; Aged; Atherosclerosis; Cholesterol, HDL; Cholesterol, LDL; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Incidence; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Triglycerides",,,,01259326,,,27550879,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021848036

Despite of aggressive treatment for cardiovascular diseases such as invasive methods,frail patients who undergo these procedures tend to experience undesirable effects compared to non frail patients. As the population of elderly patiens worldwide is growing larger, these issues lead to major health problems that we have to overcome. Association between frailty and cardiovascular disease is still debatable. Cardiovascular disease accelerates frailty. On the other hand, frail patients have higher risk of cardiac mortality and major cardiac events due to their complex health status. However, by doing good risk prediction and assessment, interventional treatment can be performed safely in selected older patients. To date, only a few studies have been conducted to investigate relationship between these two major health problems in elderly. Therefore, in this edition we highlight a study which investigate association between frailty and major adverse cardiac events in patients who underwent invasive intervention.

Current guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor for at least 12 months. Continuation of DAPT beyond 12 months may be considered for preventing very late stent thrombosis. Several patient-related factors that contribute to stent thrombosis have been recognized, including diabetes and advanced age, but the optimal DAPT duration for these patients is still controversial. This article reviews the efficacy of extended (>12 months) compared to standard (12 months) DAPT for reducing myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis rates, especially in diabetic elderly patients. Literature screening was conducted at PubMed and Cochrane database using ""dual antiplatelet"", ""duration"", ""adult-onset diabetes mellitus"", ""elderly"" and, ""drug-eluting stent"" as keywords. Article types were limited to meta-analysis, systematic review, randomized clinical trial, or clinical trial that compared the efficacy of extended to standard duration of DAPT. Clinical outcomes used were myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis. The initial search was done to find relevant studies specifically assessing diabetic and elderly patients, then widened to diabetic and non-diabetic patients of any age above eighteen years. A total of 5 clinical trials and 1 meta-analysis were reviewed, showing an overall risk reduction of stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction. This review has several limitations, such as its potential selection bias and under-represented proportion of diabetic and elderly patients. High-risk subgroups like diabetes mellitus has a tendency of increased ischemic risk, while advanced age could have both increased ischemic risk and bleeding risk. This review suggests that it is better to reserve extended dual antiplatelet therapy for patients with high ischemic risk and low bleeding risk (tailored therapy).",,"acetylsalicylic acid; antithrombocytic agent; purinergic P2Y receptor antagonist; adverse effects; aged; combination drug therapy; complication; Coronary Disease; diabetes mellitus; drug eluting stent; evidence based medicine; human; Myocardial Infarction; thrombosis; time factor; Aged; Aspirin; Coronary Disease; Diabetes Complications; Drug Therapy, Combination; Drug-Eluting Stents; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Myocardial Infarction; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Purinergic P2Y Receptor Antagonists; Thrombosis; Time Factors",,,,01259326,,,26586393,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85003967127

IBS is characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence of specific organic pathology. The diagnosis of IBS usually depends primarily on established clinical criteria. Currently, Rome III criteria are the criteria of choice for defining IBS. However, aging itself is categorized as one of the alarm symptoms in the diagnosis of IBS that may warrant further investigation. Therefore, exclusion of organic diseases, using several investigations, is of paramount important in the older patients. In general, the treatment of IBS in the elderly is not different from the younger populations. However, greater caution needs to be considered before treating with drugs because of the altered risk-benefit profile in the elderly. Several studies have shown a strong relationship of IBS with psychiatric conditions.

Based on a previous study for evaluation, we used cut off pants of 5 ng/ml and 0.5 ng/ml for PCT and 30 μg/ml and 25 μg/ml for LBP after three-day and seven-day treatment respectively. Receiver operating curve was made to determine the sensitivity and specificity of PCT and LBP as infection markers. 35 patients participated in this study. After three days of therapy, if the level of PCT >5 ng/mL and LBP >30 μg/mL the prognosis would be bad (p<0.05) with a sensitivity of 88.5%, specificity of 53.2% and AUC value 0.69. Poor prognosis was also found if after seven day therapy PCT level was >0.5 ng/mL and LBP level >25 μg/mL (p<0.05) with sensitivity of 96.3%, specificity of 66.7% and AUC value 0.81. examination of combined PCT and LBP can be taken as a good prognostic markers to predict mortality in patients with VAP.",,"acute phase protein; biological marker; calcitonin; carrier protein; lipopolysaccharide binding protein; lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; membrane protein; procalcitonin; protein precursor; calcitonin; carrier protein; membrane protein; protein precursor; adult; article; blood; chi square distribution; clinical trial; cohort analysis; female; human; male; middle aged; mortality; prognosis; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; severity of illness index; ventilator associated pneumonia; mortality; Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated; Acute-Phase Proteins; Adult; Biological Markers; Calcitonin; Carrier Proteins; Chi-Square Distribution; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Membrane Glycoproteins; Middle Aged; Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Protein Precursors; ROC Curve; Severity of Illness Index; Acute-Phase Proteins; Adult; Biological Markers; Calcitonin; Carrier Proteins; Chi-Square Distribution; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Membrane Glycoproteins; Middle Aged; Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Protein Precursors; ROC Curve; Severity of Illness Index","Rumende, C.M.email: rumende_martin@yahoo.com",,,01259326,,,23770787,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891705665

For dementia and stroke, a communication disorder due to language deterioration is one of the main problems. Behavioral neurology aims to clarify the relationship between brain function and behavior; language deterioration is one of the main targets, and its clinical applications are really useful for making better understanding of patients. Language is sequences of sound or characters that carry meanings for communication. From the evolutionary perspective, ""language"" can be thought about by considering birds and dogs: the basal ganglia and anterior cingulate, and the thalamus and cerebral cortex are thought to provide the neurobiological background, respectively. Humans can use language. The language area is a newly developed brain area in evolution and is mainly localized in the left cerebral hemisphere. Semantic memory has also developed in humans. There are two routes, the superficial and deep routes, with the latter associated with meaning, and three brain areas are involved: the peri-Sylvian area, per-peri-Sylvian area, and right hemisphere. Using these principles, language symptoms of dementia with progressive non-fluent aphasia (PA), semantic dementia (SD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD) can be understood. Namely, the symptoms of PA is understood by the dysfunction of peri-Sylvian language area, those of SD and AD by that of peri-peri-Sylvian language area, and those of some VaD cases and AD cases by that of right hemisphere.",,"aging; Alzheimer disease; brain; frontotemporal dementia; human; language; language disability; multiinfarct dementia; pathophysiology; physiology; review; Aging; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Dementia, Vascular; Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration; Humans; Language; Language Disorders","Meguro, K.email: k-meg@umin.ac.jp",,,01259326,,,23314975,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878234001

METHODS: Our study was a retrospective study on VEGF-A expression and desmoplastic reaction in pathology anatomy specimens of patients with colorectal cancer at young age (less than 40 years of age) and older age (more than equal 60 years of age). The samples had been taken since 2001 until 2008 and the sample size for each group was 42 samples for young age and 36 samples for older age subjects. To carry out the examination of VEGF expression, our study utilized the immunohistochemistry method. In addition, desmoplastic reaction as a preliminary study was evaluated by using routine HE staining. To recognize the difference of VEGF-A expression and the degree of desmoplastic reaction in young aged and older aged patients with colorectal cancer, a Chi-Square test was performed. The statistics was considered as significant when p value <0.05. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were at younger age (< or =40 years) and 36 patients were at older age (> or =60 years), with characteristics of them 37 males and 41 females.

Its existence is incurable (yet) and has reached pandemic proportions despite strictly-controlled epidemiological surveillance. The current treatment regimen involves the use of multiple antiretroviral agents (known as HAART) is very complex and may harm patients through its serious risk of toxicities. Moreover, the continuing emergence of drug resistance further threaten the future therapy, thereby necessitates another treatment strategy i.e. specific and efficient with low or minimal toxicity. RNAi is a potent candidate for the future treatment of HIV-1. It involves an immune-based silencing mechanism (post transcriptional gene silencing/PTGS) that uses small sequence of RNA (21-25 nucleotides in length) to inhibit almost every genes expression, including HIV-1 RNA and its mRNA byproducts. Since RNAi uses sequence of base pairs, it can be designed very specific and homologues to silence the genes in favor. RNAi works either through binding with HIV-1 to inhibit provirus integration into cellular genome or with mRNA products to inhibit certain genes expression (e.g. p24/Gag, Vif, Rev) that plays an important role in HIV-1 infectivity to knockdown its virulence capacity. Given the need for a treatment modality that are sequence-specific and able to overcome the highly mutation rate of virus like HIV-1, also by its enormous power to inhibit HIV-1 expression through various target sites, it is considered essential to discuss the molecular mechanism of RNAi, progresses that have been achieved, and future directions for its use in clinical settings.",,"small interfering RNA; virus RNA; drug effect; gene expression regulation; gene therapy; genetics; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; methodology; physiology; review; RNA interference; RNA processing; RNA stability; virus replication; Gene Expression Regulation, Viral; Gene Therapy; HIV-1; Humans; RNA Interference; RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional; RNA Stability; RNA, Small Interfering; RNA, Viral; Virus Replication","Soejitno, A.email: andreas.soejitno@live.com",,,01259326,,,20124619,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957268423

Malignant mesothelioma is a highly aggressive tumor from mesothel that has a tendency to grow rapidly and invade locally. Although the incidence of malignant mesenterial mesothelioma is not so high, the case fatality rate is very high. The aim of this case report is to report the rare and difficult case with several complications. A Balinese man, 64 years old, came with chief complaint of weakness, abdominal enlargement, and nausea, with history of previous liver disease. On physical examination were found a decrease of conciousness, subfebrile, abdominal distension, ascites, negative traube space, and paralysis of the left side of the body. Laboratory examination results showed leukocytosis, hypochromic-micrositic anemia, trombocytosis, hypoalbuminemia, increase of alkaline phosphatase, and mild hyponatremia. Abdominal USG showed intraperitoneal mass which some of them attach to abdominal wall, possibly from mesenterium and ascites, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed reflux esofagitis and anthral erossive gastritis, skull CT scan showed small infarction at left parietal medulla and right basal ganglia, cytology showed spreaded and grouped mesothel with reactive lymphocyte and amorph back ground. FNAB result showed malignant mesothelioma, and normal colonoscopy. Based on the above data, the diagnoses were malignant mesenterial mesothelioma, reflux esofagitis and anthral erossive gastritis, and non hemorrhagic stroke. Malignant mesenterial mesothelioma should be considered in patient with the combination of unexplained ascites and abdominal pain.

Clinically, there are some findings that indicate the role of inflammatory process in pathogenesis of IBS; such as, the onset of IBS that occurs after an episode of gastroenteritis (post-infective IBS (PI-IBS)). Although there is less evidence supporting genetic factors in pathogenesis of IBS, there are some reports about serotonin release in the plasma correlated to predominant constipation symptom. In contrast, increased serotonin release in IBS cases correlated to predominant diarrhea symptom. The stress-mast cell axis is one of pathophysiologic pathway that is expected to be able to explain the correlation between stress and characteristics found in IBS symptoms. Psychosocial factor has been well-considered to have important role in pathogenesis of IBS. Diagnosis of IBS is based on history of pain or abdominal discomfort that correlated to abnormal defecation pattern, without any obvious alarm sign. Nowadays, there is no specific laboratory test or physical or biochemical marker pathognomonic for IBS; therefore, clinical symptoms become the main modality in diagnosing IBS. This article will discuss the pathophysiology and diagnosis of IBS which will be helpful for clinicians in the management of IBS in daily practice.",,"corticotropin releasing factor; serotonin; genetics; human; irritable colon; metabolism; pathophysiology; physical examination; review; risk factor; Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone; Humans; Irritable Bowel Syndrome; Physical Examination; Risk Factors; Serotonin","Abdullah, M.email: gitipdui@cbn.net.id",,,01259326,,,19151451,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67651220679

METHODS: We evaluated 36 patients at Tan Tock Seng Hospital in Singapore, who were receiving thrice weekly maintenance hemodialysis for at least 6 months. Patients with history of previous parathyroidectomy were excluded from the study. Patient's weight, length of dialysis per week, duration of dialysis, serum calcium, phosphate, albumin, bicarbonate, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), and single pool Kt/V were retrieved from patient's medical records. RESULTS: The mean length of weekly dialysis session and single pool Kt/V was 13.5 hours and 1.73 respectively. The majority of patients achieved the target range of serum phosphorus (67%), corrected calcium (58%) and calcium times phosphate (Ca ' P) product (81%). Only 25% of patients had levels of iPTH within the target range (150-300 pg/mL). Ninety four percent of the patients were on calcium-based phosphate binder and 42% on vitamin D therapy. A significant number of patients still fell out of the recommended guideline range for serum concentrations of phosphorus (11% of patients below lower target range, 22% of patients above upper target range), corrected calcium (3% below, 39% above), calcium-phosphorus product (19% above), and iPTH (58% below, 17% above). Thirty percent of the patients had levels of iPTH < 100 pg/mL. CONCLUSION: Compared to data reported from the USA, Europe and Japan, mean levels of phosphate, corrected calcium and Ca ' P product seem better controlled in this hemodialysis Asian population. However, more than half of the patients may have oversuppression of iPTH levels and a third of patients are at increased risk of developing a dynamic bone disease.",,"calcium; calcium phosphate; phosphate; article; blood; bone disease; chemically induced disorder; comparative study; female; human; hyperthyroidism; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; prevalence; prospective study; renal replacement therapy; risk factor; Singapore; Bone Diseases; Calcium; Calcium Phosphates; Female; Humans; Hyperthyroidism; Male; Middle Aged; Phosphates; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Renal Dialysis; Risk Factors; Singapore","Lim, S.",,,01259326,,,17485789,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38449083998

We investigated the rearrangements of B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2), BCL6 and Paired homeobox 5 (PAX5) genes in Indonesian follicular lymphoma (FL) patients. METHODS: We examined gene rearrangements using various kinds of polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) on 24 patients' peripheral blood DNA. RESULTS: BCL2 rearrangement was found in 58% (14 of 24 patients), 8 at mbr (major breakpoint region), 2 at mcr (minor cluster region) and 4 at icr (intermediate cluster region), respectively. No rearrangement in BCL6 and PAX5 was detected. There was a significant difference in the incidence of spleen involvement between patients with BCL-2 rearrangement and without it (50% vs. 11%, p=0.04).

METHODS: Subjects were al apparently healthy men coming for routine medical examination to the private clinic and Internal Medicine Clinic of Jaury Academic Hospital October 2002 to January 2003 were asked to participate in this study. Complete physical examination was done to all subjects including BMI, waist circumference, and blood pressure. Blood samples were collected after 12 hour fasting for triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol examination as well as oral glucose tolerance test. As proposed by WHO, Asian adult male waist circumference is abnormal if >or= 90 cm. Using modified NCEP ATP III criteria, diagnosis of metabolic syndrome is made only if a combination of at least three of the following abnormalities: waist circumference >or= 90 cm, blood pressure >or= 130/ >or= 85 mmHg, triglyceride level >or= 150 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol level < 40 mg/dl, glucose intolerance including imparied fasting glucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance, and diabetes mellitus were found. RESULTS: Total number of subjects was 227 men aged between 21-81 years, 127 males (56.4$) fulfilled the criteria of metabolic syndrome. From a total of 151 subjects with waist circumference >or= 90 cm, 112 subjects (79.2%) fulfilled the criteria, and this gave a relative risk of 11.3 times higher to these subjects compared to those with waist circumference < 90 cm (95% CI 5.76-22.16; p< 0.0001). By reducing the waist circumference, 178 subjects were found to have WC >or= 85 cm, and 117 subjects (66.5%) fulfilled the criteria of metabolic syndrome.

One day prior to hospital discharge, each respondent was requested to fill out th BDI and modified SF-36 questionnaires. Two months afterwards, each respondent was re-evaluated by filling out the same questionnaires. Bivariant analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation between depression, other determinants, and quality of life. RESULTS: From 30 respondents (15 respondents with depression and 15 without depression), we found that 4 of the 15 patients form the non-depressed group (26.7%) developed depression 2 months post AMI.

METHODS: Serum samples of 148 patients who presented an INR < 0.9 or prothrombin activity of > 130% or aPTT below 0.8 times control or thrombosis with aPTT below 1.2 times control were tested in a 22-time running test to determine IgG and IgM ACA levels using Quanta Lite ACA IgG (HRP) and Quanta Lite ACA IgM (HRP) commercial reagents. RESULTS: Coefficients of variant within runs and batches of standard negative control IgG and IgM ACA levels were 19.30% and 29.17% respectively. Using kappa statistics to determine degree of agreement between cut-off levels by deviation from standard negative control and fixed cut-off level of ACA identified using ELISA, the disagreement in IgM and IgG were k 0.30, and 95% CI of k 0.27 to 0.34 (z = 1.033, p = 0.3015), and k 0.63, and 95% CI of k 0.53 to 0.73 (z = 1.411, p = 0.1584) for cut-off levels based on deviations from standard negative control and fixed cut-off levels respectively. Cut-off levels based on deviation from standard negative control was more sensitive, with a 92% predictive true positive value, compared to a 69% predictive true positive value by fixed cut-off levels of IgM ACA detected using ELISA, and nearly equivalent to IgG ACA, with 84.4% and 87.1% predictive true positive values respectively. CONCLUSION: Cut-off points based on fixed levels of ACA detected using ELISA cannot be applied, because both IgG and IgM ACA levels of standard negative control were inconsistent among runs and batches.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 84 patients admitted to the geriatric inpatient ward of dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. The patients underwent anamnesis, administration of a dietary questionnaire which included SQFF and food recording, physical examination, laboratory investigations (blood, urine and benzidine test), chest x-ray, ECG and spirometry. Anemic elderly patients also underwent iron store measurements, including serum iron (SI), total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and serum ferritin (SF). RESULTS: The proportion of anemia was 54.76%. Increased anemia was inversely correlated with increased body mass index (OR 0.870; 95% CI 0.762-0.994), serum albumin (OR 0.285; 95% CI 0.090-0.907) and calorie intake (OR 0.998; 95% CI 0.996-0.999), and positively correlated with renal impairment (OR 2.647; 95% CI 1.084-6.467). Anemia due to chronic disease (ACD) accounted for 21 subjects, 5 subjects with iron deficiency coexisting with ACD, 1 subject with megaloblastic anemia, and the cause of anemia in 19 patients could not be identified due to diagnostic procedural limitation. Most of the anemic elderly subjects had normal iron deposits. As many as 42.1% of the men and 44.4% of the women had elevated iron deposits. The level of hemoglobin, SI, TIBC in ACD patients were lower than in non-ACD patients (Hb 10.4 vs 10.8 g/dl, SI 58.71 vs. 92.38 ug/dl, TIBC 283.11 vs. 288.95 microg/dl). In contrast, serum ferritin levels in ACD patients were higher than in non-ACD (178.26 vs. 111.35 ng/ml).

Methods: A study was conducted on 76 subjects whose age 40 to 70 years. Subjects consisted of 38 patients of post ischemic stroke and 38 controls with diagnosis other than stroke. Fresh blood samples were taken and mixed with EDTA for viscosity examination and serum for ACA IgM and IgG examination. The laboratory examination for persistent ACA IgM and IgG used ELISA method, while viscosity analysis was using viscometer. Statistic analysis used chi-square and multivariate analysis with logistic regression. RESULTS: In this study we found persistent ACA IgG in 25% of case group , and 2.63% in control group. Multivariate analysis showed persistent ACA IgG as risk factor for ischemic stroke with p < 0.05 and OR 14.11 (CI 95%:1.64;121.11).

The purpose of the study is to obtain a scoring system to diagnose DIC in sepsis. SUBJECT AND METHODS: An observational study with a cross-sectional design was performed at the Department of Internal Medicine, University of Indonesia, Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital from February to August 2002. Subjects were septic patients in the emergency unit or inpatient ward of the Department of Internal Medicine, and were taken consecutively. The criteria of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock were based on ACCP/SCCM Consensus 1991. The evaluation conformed to the Thrombosis Hemostasis Center (THC) scoring system, compared with modified Bick scoring system as a gold standard. RESULTS: There were 34 subjects ranging from 19 to 78 years old, 32.4% were septic patients, 41.2% with severe sepsis and 26.5% with septic shock. The most common source of infection was pneumonia, where bacterial pathogens were found in 35.2% of blood aerobic culture and 17.7% in pus or urine culture. Gram negative bacteria was the most common pathogen found. According to a modified Bick and THC scoring system, DIC was found in all subjects, consisting of mild and moderate DIC. No severe DIC was found. There was no difference between both scoring systems, with a p value of 0.125 based on the Mc Nemar test. There was no difference found in mild and moderate DIC in sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock of modified Bick scoring systems (p value of 0.987) and THC scoring system (p value of 1.000). CONCLUSION: No difference was found between THC and modified Bick scoring system in diagnosing DIC in septic patients. In sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock, mild and moderate DIC complications can be diagnosed with THC scoring system, which are of the same potency with the modified Bick, with the assumption that the modified Bick scoring system was the same as the Bick scoring system.",,"adult; aged; article; blood clotting test; cross-sectional study; disseminated intravascular clotting; female; hemostasis; human; male; middle aged; risk assessment; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; sepsis; septic shock; thrombosis; Adult; Aged; Blood Coagulation Tests; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation; Female; Hemostasis; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sepsis; Shock, Septic; Thrombosis","Sukrisman, L.",,,01259326,,,15673932,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-24044451911

We found moderate correlation (r=0.59; p<0.001) between afternoon urine osmolality and a 24-hour urine osmolality. Using ROC curve, the AUC value was 0.792 (95% CI, 0.708-0.875) with the cut off 528 mOsm/kg H2O. To assess the optimal hydration status, the afternoon urine osmolality had the sensitivity of 0.7 (95% CI, 0.585-0.795) and the specificity of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.626-0.857), Likelihood Ratio (LR) (+) 2.917 (95% CI, 1.74-4.889) and LR (-) 0.395 (95% CI, 0.267-0.583).CONCLUSION: afternoon urine osmolality can be used as a diagnostic tool to assess the optimal hydration status in healthy population with cut off 528 mOsm/kg H2O, sensitivity of 0.7, and specificity of 0.76.BACKGROUND: optimal hydration represents adequate total daily fluid intake to compensate for daily water losses, ensure adequate urine output to reduce the risk of urolithiasis and renal function decline, and also avoid the production of arginine vasopressin (AVP). Twenty-four-hour urine osmolality has been used to assess hydration status, but it is challenging because of the possibility of spilling urine and limitation of daily activities. This study is aimed to determine the performance of the afternoon urine osmolality to assess the optimal hydration status compared with 24-hour urine osmolality.METHODS: a cross sectional study was conducted on healthy employees aged 18-59 years at Universitas Indonesia Medical Faculty/Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, with consecutive sampling method.

Frailty syndrome is potentially improved by modifying insulin resistance, inflammation, and myostatin level. This study is aimed to investigate the effect of metformin on handgrip strength, gait speed, myostatin serum level, and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) among non-diabetic pre-frail elderly patients.METHODS: a double blind randomized controlled trial study was conducted on non-diabetic elderly outpatients aged ≥ 60 years with pre-frail status based on phenotype and/ or index criteria (Cardiovascular Health Study and/ or Frailty Index 40 items) consecutively recruited from March 2015 to June 2016 at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. One-hundred-twenty subjects who met the research criteria were randomized and equally assigned into 3 x 500 mg metformin or placebo group. The study outcomes were measured at baseline and after 16 weeks of intervention.RESULTS: out of 120 subjects, 43 subjects in metformin group and 48 subjects in placebo group who completed the intervention. There was a significant improvement on the mean gait speed of metformin group by 0.39 (0.77) second or 0.13 (0.24) meter/second that remained significant after adjusting for important prognostic factors (p = 0.024). There was no significant difference on handgrip strength, myostatin serum level, and HR-QoL between both groups.CONCLUSION: 3 x 500 mg metformin for 16 weeks was statistically significant and clinically important in improving usual gait speed as one of the HR-QoL dimensions, but did not significantly improve the EQ-5D index score, handgrip strength, nor myostatin serum level.","elderly; gait speed; handgrip strength; health-related quality of life; metformin; myostatin serum; pre-frail","antidiabetic agent; metformin; myostatin; aged; blood; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug effects; female; hand strength; human; male; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; walking speed; Aged; Double-Blind Method; Female; Hand Strength; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Male; Metformin; Myostatin; Quality of Life; Walking Speed",,,,01259326,,,28790226,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041274397

Many factors such as gastric motility disorder, visceral hypersensitivity, Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection, psychological stress and excessive gastric acid secretion play roles in this symptom. Psychological stress may promote peptic ulcer and has an effect on ulcers-associated Hp. This study aimed to determine Helicobacter pylori activity and expression of mucosal IL-6 and their association with psychological stress.METHODS: a cross-sectional study was done among 40 outpatients with dyspeptic syndromes in M. Djamil General Hospital and two-community health centers in Padang. The subjects were divided into two groups, with and without psychological stress, which were identified using DASS 42. Gastric biopsy specimens and peripheral blood samples were taken while performing esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Immunohistochemistry methods was used to determine the expression of IL-6 and Hp in gastric mucosa. The correlation of each variable in the group experiencing psychological stress and non-stress was analyzed using Chi-square test.RESULTS: there were 40 patients with functional dyspepsia with average age of 37.58(SD 11.82) years old. The cortisol levels were significantly different between both groups (non-stress vs. stress groups); moreover, morning cortisol level in psychological stress group was higher beyond normal limit. Inter-Leukin-6 expression, as the evidence of inflammatory activity, seemed higher in non-stress group than the group with psychological stress (8.25% vs. 7.25%). Helicobacter pylori activity was seemed to be increased in the stress group as characterized by higher numbers of invasion to the sub mucosa epithelium compared to the non-stress group (11 vs. 7 subjects).CONCLUSION: psychological stress seems to have no correlation with IL-6 in gastric mucous of patients with functional dyspepsia; however, there is an evidence of increasing activity of Helicobacter pylori.","functional dyspepsia; Helicobacter pylori; interleukin 6 (IL-6); psychological stress","hydrocortisone; interleukin 6; adult; blood; clinical trial; complication; cross-sectional study; dyspepsia; female; Helicobacter infection; Helicobacter pylori; human; immunohistochemistry; isolation and purification; male; mental stress; metabolism; microbiology; multicenter study; stomach mucosa; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dyspepsia; Female; Gastric Mucosa; Helicobacter Infections; Helicobacter pylori; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Immunohistochemistry; Interleukin-6; Male; Stress, Psychological",,,,01259326,,,28790223,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041256138

Indonesia itself has more than 7,500 recurrent cases annually, regardless of reinfection or relapse. This is an important problem, as recurrent TB is associated with lower cure rates with the anti-TB therapy and higher risk of developing drug resistance. Some risk factors for this recurrence are smoking, poor treatment adherence, low economic status, and weak immune status. This study is aimed to identify whether the use of fixed-dose combination (FDC) anti-tuberculosis therapy increases the risk for tuberculosis recurrence compared with using separate drug formulation.METHODS: the search was conducted on MEDLINE, ProQuest, EBSCO, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane according to clinical question. The studies were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria and led to five useful articles. The selected studies were critically appraised for their validity, importance, and applicability.RESULTS: five cohort studies were found with comparable validity.

First, we utilized probit regression analysis and included, among others, the following variables: patients' status (active or drop out), CD4 cell count, TB and opportunistic infection (OI), work status, sex, history of injecting drugs, and support from family and peers. Second, we used the drop out data from our database and CD 4 cell count decline rate from another study to estimate the productivity loss due to HIV patients drop out.RESULTS: lower CD4 cell count was associated with a higher probability of drop out. Support from family/peers, living with family, and diagnosed with TB were associated with lower probability of drop out. The productivity loss at national level due to treatment drop out (consequently, due to CD4 cell count decline) can reach US$365 million (using average wage).CONCLUSION: first, as lower CD 4 cell count was associated with higher probability of drop out, we recommend (to optimize) early ARV initiation at a higher CD 4 cell count, involving scaling up HIV service at the community level. Second, family/peer support should be further emphasized to further ensure treatment success. Third, dropping out from ART will result in a relatively large productivity loss.","antiretroviral therapy; drop out; HIV; Indonesia; socio-economic","adult; CD4 lymphocyte count; economics; female; HIV Infections; human; Indonesia; male; patient dropout; prevalence; risk factor; social support; statistics and numerical data; Adult; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Indonesia; Male; Patient Dropouts; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Social Support",,,,01259326,,,27840355,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011565121

","AIM: to evaluate the analgesic effect, the side effects and the safety of analgesics following endoscopic urological procedure.METHODS: eighty patients who underwent endoscopic urological surgery at Kardinah Hospital, Tegal from June to July 2015 were divided into four groups. The experimental group was administered analgesic for 4 days pipemidic acid (A) 400 mg bid, or phenazopyridine (B) 200 mg tid, or sodium diclofenac (C) 50 mg bid and the control (D) group was administered placebo tid for 4 days. The analgesic effects were assessed using Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Association between variables was assessed using Cramers V and Kruskall Wallis.RESULTS: the endoscopic urological procedures consisted of 30 patients for URS, 6 patients for lithotripsy, 17 patients for TURP, 24 patients for removal JJ stent and 3 patients for cystoscopy. The mean age of group A, B, C and D (control) was 50.1 (13.7), 50.7 (14.8), 49.1 (13.4), and 49.6 (14.3) years, respectively, and follow-up period was 7 days. The VAS score in all experimental groups was less than control group on day 1 to 7 following endoscopic urological procedures (p<0.05).

In regression analysis that were conducted on the relationship between the difference in pre-hemodialysis sodium levels subtracted by previous post-hemodiaysis sodium levels (Y) and the difference in pre-hemodialysis weight subtractted by previous post-hemodialysis weight (X), a significant causal relationship was found with the regression formula of Y=-2.205+0.937 X.CONCLUSION: Plasma sodium levels in chronic hemodialysis patients can be used as predictors of body fluid volume or extracellular fluid volume. At each dialysis unit, the recommended weight gain for the patients are 2.5 kg-2.9 kg, in order to prevent a significant decrease in plasma sodium levels that could lead to mortality.",,"sodium; blood; body water; body weight; chronic kidney failure; female; human; male; middle aged; physiology; renal replacement therapy; Body Water; Body Weight; Female; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Middle Aged; Renal Dialysis; Sodium",,,,01259326,,,25633549,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942614537

We would like to report a case of transcatheter closure of residual VSD post Rastelli operation in a patient with double outlet right ventricle (DORV), sub-aortic VSD, severe infundibulum pulmonary stenosis (PS) and single coronary artery. The patient had undergone operations for four times, but he still had intractable heart failure that did not response to medications. On the first attempt. we closed the VSD using a VSD occluder, unfortunately the device embolized into the descending aorta, but fortunately we was able to snare it out. Then we decided to close the VSD using a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA occluder). On transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and angiography evaluation, the device position was stable. Post transcatheter VSD closure, the patient clinical condition improved significantly and he could finally be discharged after a long post-surgery hospitalization.

Because of its effect on ambulation and mobility, it has significant functional impact and is associated with considerable medical costs. Because of the aging of the society and the obesity epidemic, the burden of OA can be expected to increase over the next 20 years. Although OA has been regarded primarily as a non-inflammatory arthropathy, symptoms of local inflammation and synovitis are present in many patients and have been observed and even in the absence of classical inflammation, which is characterized by infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into joint tissue, elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines have been measured in OA synovial fluid. Although the cartilage lesion is present at sites remote from synovium, the fibroblast- and macrophage-like synovial cells, as well as the chondrocytes itself, are potential sources of cytokines that could induce chondrocytes to synthesize and secrete cartilage-degrading proteases, cytokines, and other inflammatory mediators. The bio-identical progesterone shows its anti-inflammatory effects in OA by suppressing gene expressions in the production of inflammatory cytokines through the negative interaction between nuclear transcription factor and the progesterone receptor and/or the progesterone-induced increase of nuclear transcription factor inhibition in the nucleus. The bio-identical progesterone may indirectly regulate bone remodeling and may also play a role in the development and maintenance of cartilage.

Candesartan and candesartan/HCT were effective in lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline at weeks 4, 8, and 12, in both groups, with 26-27 mm Hg decreases in SBP at week 12 and a trend toward a larger reduction in treatment-naive patients than in previously treated patients, although not statistically significant. However, in terms of patients achieving a BP of <140/90 mm Hg between groups were significantly superior in treatment-naive patients than in previously treated patients at week 8 (56% vs 40%; p=0.003) and week 12 (69% vs 53%; p=0.004). Candesartan and candesartan/HCT were also effective for patients with long-standing (>4 years) uncontrolled hypertension with previous antihypertensive therapy, which was most commonly calcium channel blockers (became controlled in >50% of all uncontrolled patients). results of this open observational study showed that candesartan and candesartan/HCT were well tolerated and effective in both treatment-naive patients and uncontrolled hypertensive patients with previous antihypertensive treatment.",,"antihypertensive agent; benzimidazole derivative; biphenyl derivative; candesartan hexetil; diuretic agent; hydrochlorothiazide; tetrazole derivative; adult; aged; article; chemically induced disorder; drug combination; female; human; male; middle aged; multicenter study; nausea; paresthesia; prospective study; thorax pain; Adult; Aged; Antihypertensive Agents; Benzimidazoles; Biphenyl Compounds; Chest Pain; Diuretics; Drug Combinations; Female; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide; Male; Middle Aged; Nausea; Paresthesia; Prospective Studies; Tetrazoles","Setiawati, A.",,,01259326,,,24045389,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900583452

Upper respiratory tract infections and influenza are common in the elderly and may develop into pneumonia. Considering the high morbidity and mortality rates related to pneumonia in the elderly, it is important to have prevention strategies. A delay in diagnosis due to non-specific signs and symptoms of pneumonia in the elderly has demanded greater concern on the importance of pneumonia prevention strategies. Influenza and pneumonia impair quality of life in the elderly, resulted in decreased functional status (ADL scores) during infection and recovery period. With increasing antibiotic resistance, the management may be complicated as it may lead to conditions that reduce quality of life and cause high mortality rate. Therefore, immunization is very important as the prevention strategy against influenza and or pneumonia, reducing the incidence as well as the complication.

It then continued to immunohistochemistry examination of NM23HI, and cytokeratin. subjects were 29-75 years old with the mean of 48.19 years; most subjects were 40-45 years old with malignancy grade 1 numbering 18.56%; grade 2, 45.36%; and grade 3, 36.1%. Ninety seven paraffin blocks were examined from 2000 to 2006. There was a significant relationship between NM23HI expression in primary tumor with the possibility of inhibition of invasion and metastasis 11 times of those of negative expression of NM23HI. The ROC curve showed that NM23HI expression was strongly correlated (r=0.816) sensitive and specific as metastasis marker. NM23HI expression did not show significant relationship with histologic degree of invasive ductal carcinoma. NM23HI expressions can be used as invasion and metastasis markers, but cannot be used as markers for the degree of histologic malignancy of invasive ductal cancer.",,"NME1 protein, human; nucleoside diphosphate kinase NM23; tumor marker; adult; aged; article; breast tumor; cancer grading; cancer invasion; cross-sectional study; female; human; metabolism; metastasis; middle aged; Paget nipple disease; pathology; receiver operating characteristic; risk; Adult; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases; Odds Ratio; ROC Curve; Tumor Markers, Biological","Rustamadji, P.email: primariadewi@yahoo.com",,,01259326,,,22451184,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864292555

As the disease progresses, the majority of patients will require insulin therapy within 6 years of diagnosis. During the therapy, evaluation and intensification of the current treatment is required in order to achieve the good glycaemic state. In patients who are taking basal insulin or premix OD but failing to achieve the recommended glycaemic targets of HbA1c <6.5%-7%, one option is to intensify to a modern premixed insulin BID or TID. Its formulations have both basal and short or rapid-acting insulin capabilities, enabling them to cover both fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels. Other strategy is known as basal-plus method, basal plus 1 and then basal plus 2. This strategy is used by adding OD short-acting or rapid-acting insulin (analog) before having largest portion meal or before meal when blood glucose before the next meal is high.

In addition, the goal of present study is to develop a hypoxia-induced heart failure model in rats. Sprague-Dawley male rats, weighing 220-250 g at the time of recruitment were randomly allocated into 7 groups (n = 4 per group), the control normoxia group was exposed to room air, while the hypoxia groups were caged in a plexiglas hypoxic chamber (8% O2 and 92% N2) for 28 days. Structural and morphological changes of ventricular myocardium were determined at day 28, while blood gas parameters were measured at day 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. histopathologic and morphologic evaluation showed massive hypertrophy accompanied by damage of the intercalated disk (ID) structure, angiogenesis, necrosis, fibrosis, and apoptosis as a hallmark of ventricular remodeling. At the end of treatment, there were increases of LV (2.79 vs 3.71) and RV (1.72 vs 2.54) wall thicknesses, and also in hypertrophy index (from 3.19 to 5.74).

But then by the recent advanced in technology including guide wire, balloon, intravascular ultrasound, pharmacological therapy particularly of stents, it is than indicated in much more complex lesions. The extension of indication of PCI to more complex lesion were supported by many studies and clinical trials. Comprehensively indication of PCI were summarize in the two most well known guideline, following first to European Society of Cardiology (ESC, 2005) and second to the American Heart Association (AHA, 2007), American college of cardiology (ACC), and American Society of Cardiac Intervention (ASCAI).

Efforts to prevent HIV-transmission through injecting drug use mostly focus on subjects who actively inject. In scientific publications, the term 'injecting drug users' tends to be used without a clear definition and without specifying the pattern of drug use as current or former drug use, frequency, duration, type of injected drug(s) or context (e.g. imprisonment). Actually, injecting drug users (IDUs) have different drug use patterns, risk behavior, somatic co-morbidity, psychiatric co-morbidity, and psychosocial problems. In fact, these patients are suffering from addiction as a chronic brain disease in co-occurrence with somatic and psychiatric disorder and many social problems. Failing in addressing the problems comprehensively will lead to the failure of drug treatment. This is why addiction can be best studied and treated from a biopsychosocial perspective. Accordingly, treatment goals can be differentiated in crisis intervention, cure or recovery (detoxification, relapse prevention), and care or partial remission (stabilization and harm reduction). In summary, injecting drug use in Indonesia is not a single entity and patient oriented prevention and care for IDUs, especially focusing on their addiction, should be addressed to prevent the transmission of HIV/AIDS.",,"adolescent; article; disease transmission; health education; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Indonesia; substance abuse; Adolescent; Health Education; HIV Infections; Humans; Indonesia; Substance Abuse, Intravenous","Iskandar, S.email: shelly_bdg@yahoo.com",,,01259326,,,19920297,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952197789

Skin symptom is the most frequent manifestation; however, diagnosis of anaphylaxis will only be established when involving one or both vital organs, which are cardiovascular and respiratory system. Other symptom, such as that involving central nervous system or gastrointestinal tract, may accompany. We present five cases of anaphylaxis which vary in onset of symptoms, allergen, degree of severity, therapeutic response and clinical manifestation. Anaphylactic reaction to drugs in these cases is mainly manifested as anaphylactic shock and reaction to food allergen causing obstruction of respiratory tract. Four anaphylactic events occurred at home and only one occurred in a hospital, thus education on anaphylaxis to general community is very important, especially for the patients and their families. Prompt medical assistance in patients with anaphylactic symptoms determines their therapeutic response. Skin test prior to administration of cephalosporin does not give negative predictive value toward anaphylactic event.",,"adrenalin; bronchodilating agent; drug; histamine H1 receptor antagonist; histamine H2 receptor antagonist; prescription drug; unclassified drug; adolescent; adult; aged; article; case report; drug hypersensitivity; fatality; human; male; risk factor; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Bronchodilator Agents; Drug Hypersensitivity; Epinephrine; Fatal Outcome; Histamine H1 Antagonists; Histamine H2 Antagonists; Humans; Male; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Prescription Drugs; Risk Factors; Young Adult","Sundaru, H.",,,01259326,,,18838753,"English","Acta Med Indones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-59849114696

METHOD: three months old male Rattus Novergicus strain Wistar were allocated into 3 groups, normal diet group (GI, n=8), high carbohydrate diet group (GII, n=8), and high fat diet group (G III, n=8). Those groups received an isoenergetic diet but contained different percentage of carbohydrate and fat for 12 weeks. The rest of the food was measured daily to calculate the calorie intake. The body weight was measured weekly. At the end of study, blood samples were taken using cardiac puncture to examine lipid profiles and random blood sugars. RESULTS: levels of blood glucose significantly increased in GII compared to the GI (281.87 +/- 39.66 mg/dl vs 192.5 +/- 1.4 mg/dl, p=0.002). Group II and G III showed increased of triglyseride compared to GI (138.0 +/- 47.15 vs 85.5 +/-20.3, p=0.02; 163.62 +/- 41.77 vs 85.5 +/- 20.3, p=0.00, respectively). Level of LDL significantly increased in G III compared to GI (72 +/- 35.6 vs 27.0 +/- 8.9, p=0.00). No statistical difference in level of HDL among the three groups. Level of TNFalpha significantly increased in GII and G III compared to GI (19.13 +/- 3.68 vs 2.5 +/- 1.4, p=0.00; 23.6 +/- 5.58 vs 2.5 +/- 1.4, p=0.00, respectively).

METHODS: Twenty five patients undergoing pacemaker implantation were included in this study. Subjects underwent medical history and functional class was assessed using New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification. All technical parameters (pacing threshold, sensing, and pacing impedance) and clinical parameters (complication and procedure time) were measured during and post implant. RESULTS: Majority (80%) of patients were in NYHA functional class II. The commonest indication for pacemaker implant was the complete heart block (56%). The most frequent pacemaker type was single chamber (80%) with the commonest pacing mode of VVIR (72%). Average optimal parameters achieved were pacing threshold of 0.5 volt, sensing of 12.6 mV, and impedance of 829 Ohm. Average procedure time was 1.6 hour. Major complication (pocket infection) was noted in only one patient. CONCLUSION: It is confirmed from this study that permanent pacemaker implantation could be carried out safely and effectively with low complication rate in a general hospital. Optimal pacing parameters could be achieved in the acute phase. Most patients still could not afford appropriate pacing devices due to limited financial support.

The prevalence of hypertension depends on both the racial composition of the population studied and the criteria used to define the condition. Patients with hypertension die prematurely, the most common cause of death is heart disease, stroke, and renal failure. The JNC-7 report has introduced a new classification that includes term ""pre-hypertension"". The new classification may make a new dilemma in the management since the main treatment of pre-hypertension is the lifestyle changes. What do we recommend to lean patients with pre-hypertension who are already following a prudent lifestyle? The ultimate public health goal of antihypertensive therapy is the reduction of cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. The question is, what should the blood pressure goal be? For patients without any compiling condition, it was assumed that 140/90 mmHg was desired treatment target level. For diabetic patient, it is reasonable to target a blood pressure well within the normal range, at most 130/80 mmHg. Some newer studies suggest that the target of treatment may force the recommended goal even lower, even for the patient without any compiling condition. For elderly individuals, a goal of 140/90 mmHg is appropriate. Hypertension during pregnancy is one of important aspects, since blood pressure during pregnancy may change related to the gestational age. This is always subject of discussion because there is no evidence that pharmacologic treatment results in improved neonatal outcomes, lower blood pressure may, in fact uteroplacental perfusion and thereby jeopardize fetal development. It means that more attention is needed for hypertensive patients not only for treatment regimens choice but also the blood pressure target. The accurate measurement of blood pressure is the sine qua non for successful management of hypertension. The operator should be trained and regularly retrained in the standardized technique, to avoid the chance of mismanagement.",,"blood pressure; blood pressure measurement; differential diagnosis; hospitalization; human; hypertension; methodology; physiology; review; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Determination; Diagnosis, Differential; Humans; Hypertension; Severity of Illness Index","Rudijanto, A.",,,01259326,,,17132887,"English","Acta Med Indones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-39049187374

The improved health of all peoples is the main goal of medical education, including for the education of internal medicine registrars. The future development of the direction and goal of education, the level of competence of internal medicine specialists, and the process of learning will be related to preparing the internal medicine specialist to have global competitive advantage. Identification of general competencies is the first step in a long-term effort designed to emphasize educational outcome, for assessment in residency programs, and in the accreditation process. To achieve that competence, a variety of learning opportunities need to be provided in order that the resident can achieve the necessary knowledge, skills, attitude, and behaviors. Identification of the role and function of internal medicine specialists is needed prior to the development of the general competencies. As educational objectives, the competencies fall into two main categories: knowledge-based and performance-based. Knowledge-based competency has two components, medical knowledge (bio-science and clinical medicine) and contextual knowledge (epidemiology, health service organization, and human behavior). The performance base has two components, intellectual skills and the interpersonal skills. Besides the two main categories of educational objectives, there are behavioral objectives that residents must achieve through the educational program, to ensure that residents are able to deal with a range of prescribed clinical situations effectively, safely, humanely, and economically. The achievement of behavioral objectives will ensure, at least in part, that the doctor will implement good medical practice. The index clinical/community situations (ICS) on which the educational objectives will be based are taken from diseases and illnesses that occur in clinical and community settings. No resident can master all medicine there is to know, as there are no limits to what can be known about medicine.

METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study where study subjects are recruited using multi-stage sampling. The data are descriptively processed using T-test, Pearson correlates, and multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: The proportion of mild, moderate, and severe reductions in renal function in Minahasanese with chronic gout arthritis and tophi were as follows: 25 patients (69.7%), 7 patients (19.5%), and 5 patients (11%). According to Pearson correlation, only urinary uric acid excretion (r=0.626, p=0.000). The same findings were found using multiple regression, only urinary uric acid excretion is significant (p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Most Minahasanese with chronic gout arthritis and tophi suffer from a mild reduction in renal function associated with the amount of uric acid excreted in the urine, but not associated with age, serum uric acid level, duration of gout arthritis, or tophi.

METHODS: In this double blind, randomized, parallel study, 2-dose regimens of intra venous (IV) granisetron were evaluated in 39 cancer patients who were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomized to receive granisetron 1 mg IV plus dexamethasone 20 mg (group A) or granisetron 3 mg iv plus dexamethasone 20 mg (group B). A questionnaire was used to evaluate the anti-emetic effects of granisetron. RESULTS: Subjects consisted of 31 men and 8 women. In group A (19 patients) 57.9% showed complete response from vomiting, 10.5% of major response, and 31.6% of failure to anti-emetic therapy. There were 47.4% of patients free from nausea and 52.6% complained of nausea (mild, moderate, and severe nausea). Among group B (20 patients), 90% showed complete response from vomiting, 5% of major response, and 5% of failure to anti-emetic therapy. Eighty percent of patients were free from nausea, while 15% complained of mild nausea and 5% of moderate nausea. The differences were statistically significant for vomiting (p = 0.02) as well as for nausea (p = 0.03).

METHODS: a cohort study was conducted in 3350 children who were born in 1988-1990 in Tanjungsari Subdistrict, Sumedang, West Java. A complete anthropometric data since their birth were collected from October 2002-February 2003. Inclusion criteria: Children who had birth weight in the range of +/- 3 of standard deviation (SD). Post natal growth disorder based on Z score of height according to age group and height changes at the age of 0-12 months and 12-36 months. SGA criteria were determined based on cross tabulation between weight and birth length at birth. Study subjects were divided into control group, groups of pre natal, post natal and pre-postnatal growth disorder. All subjects were checked for lipid profiles. Statistical calculation used analysis of variance, t test and logistic regression. 312 subjects were included in this study, 73 were in control group, 90 subjects in postnatal, 96 subjects were in pre natal and 53 subjects were in pre-post natal growth disorder group. RESULTS: this study has not shown significant difference in risk factor of having abnormal lipid profile between normal control group and growth disorder group except for those in prenatal growth disorder group with RR = 2.375 (p = 0.014). CONCLUSION: the post natal growth disorder had not influenced lipid profile in adolescents with SGA.
