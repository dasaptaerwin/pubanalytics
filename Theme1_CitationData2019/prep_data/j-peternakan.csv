Selection for fatty acids traits based on molecular marker assisted selection is needed to increase a value of chicken meat. This study was designed to analyze expression and associations of SCD gene polymorphisms with fatty acid traits in F2 kampung-broiler chicken cross. A total of 62 F2 kampung-broiler chicken cross (29 males and 33 females) were used in this study. Fatty acid traits were measured at 26 weeks of age. Samples were divided into two groups based on fatty acid traits (the highest and the lowest). Primers in exon 2 region were designed from the genomic chicken sequence. The SNP g.37284A>G was detected and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was then used to genotype. The expression of SCD gene was analyzed using quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). The result showed that there were three genotypes (AA, AG, and GG) found in this study. The SCD|AciI polymorphism was significantly associated with palmitoleic acid (C16:1), fatty acids total and saturated fatty acid in 26 weeks old of F2 kampung-broiler chicken cross (P < 0.05). The SCD gene was expressed for polyunsaturated fatty acids in liver tissue in two groups of chickens. In conclusion, the SCD gene could be a candidate gene that affects fatty acids traits in F2 kampung-broiler chicken cross.","Expression; Fatty acid; Kampung-broiler chicken cross; Polymorphism; SCD gene",,"Sumantri, C.; Department of Animal Production and Technology, Faculty of Animal Science, Bogor Agricultural University Jalan Agatis, Darmaga CampusIndonesia; email: csumantri12@gmail.com",,"Bogor Agricultural University",01260472,,,,"English","Media Peternakan",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039553216

A database was developed from various in vivo experiments involving sheep as the experimental animals in which energy intake, protein intake and average daily weight gain (ADG) were reported. A total of 38 articles consisting of 137 data points were integrated into the database. Different breeds (Priangan, fat-tailed and local) and sexes (male and female) were specified in the database. Maintenance and gain requirements of dry matter, energy and protein were determined by regressing ADG with dry matter intake (DMI), total digestible nutrient intake (TDNI) and crude protein intake (CPI), respectively. An intercept (where ADG= 0 g/kg MBW/d) and a slope (required nutrient intake per unit ADG) were taken as maintenance and gain requirements, respectively. Results revealed that all sheep breeds had similar energy requirement for maintenance (TDNm). Energy requirement for gain (TDNg) of Priangan breed was lower than other breeds; the breed required 0.860 g TDN for 1 g ADG. Fat-tailed and local breeds required 1.22 and 2.75 g TDN for 1 g ADG, respectively. All breeds also revealed relatively similar protein requirement for maintenance (CPm), i.e. 6.27-6.47 g/kg MBW/d. Priangan breed required less CP for 1 g ADG (CPg), i.e. 0.295 g. Requirements of CPg for fat-tailed and local breeds were 0.336 and 0.497 g/g ADG, respectively.

The experiment was arranged in a 3 x 3 factorial design with 4 replications in each treatment (10 birds each). The dietary treatments were the combination of doses of zinc (A1: 0 ppm, A2: 40 ppm, A3: 80 ppm) and vitamin E (B1: 0 ppm, B2: 125 ppm, B3: 250 ppm) supplementations. The variables observed were apparent nutrient digestibilities (apparent crude protein digestibility and apparent ether extract digestibility), carcass traits (final weight, the percentage of carcass weight, breast weight, thigh weight, wings weight, and back weight), meat bone ratio and mineral availability in the tibia (calcium [Ca], phosphorus [P], and zinc [Zn]). The results showed that apparent nutrient digestibility, carcass traits (the percentages of carcass, breast, thighs, wings, and back), meat bone ratio were not significantly influenced by the supplementation of zinc or vitamin E. The supplementation of 80 ppm of Zn and 0 ppm of vitamin E significantly (P < 0.05) increased final weight of broiler. Supplementation of zinc alone and vitamin E alone in the diet significantly (P < 0.05) increased calcium content of the tibia. In conclusion, supplementation of 80 ppm of Zn increased calcium content compared to control, but did not affect final weight and ether-extract digestibility. Supplementation of vitamin E at a dose of 125 ppm could increase calcium content of the tibia compared to control.","Broiler; Vitamin E; Zinc",,"Mutia, R.; Department of Nutrition and Feed Science, Faculty of Animal Science, Bogor Agricultural University Jalan Agatis, Kampus IPB DarmagaIndonesia; email: rmutia.1@gmail.com",,"Bogor Agricultural University",01260472,,,,"English","Media Peternakan",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018338146

The follicular fluid was collected by the aspiration technique, then it was centrifuged at 1500 g for 30 min at 24°C. The supernatant was collected and stored at -20°C until being used in the experiment for analysis of IGF-1. A total of 1105 oocytes were used in this study. The oocytes were matured in M199 without supplementation of bovine serum albumin, with supplementation of BSA, and with supplementations of 10% FF (v/v) from the follicle with diameter ø < 4 mm, 4≤ø < 6 mm, 6≤ø < 8 mm, and ø≥8 mm at the luteal phase and then fertilized. The results showed that the concentrations of IGF-I in the FF obtained during the luteal phase was significantly higher (P < 0.05) compared to those obtained during follicular phase. The IGF-I concentrations in the follicular fluid of follicle with diameter smaller than 6 mm were significantly higher (P < 0.05) compared to those with diameters larger than 6 mm. The percentage of nuclear maturation rate of oocytes cultured with FF obtained from follicle with diameter < 4 mm was significantly higher (P < 0.05) compared to those obtained from the other groups of follicle diameters. The supplementation of maturation media with BSA and FF were able to improve fertilization rate significantly (P < 0.05) compared to maturation media without BSA. In conclusion, the concentration of IGF-I in the follicular fluid obtained during the luteal phase was higher compared to those obtained during the follicular phase. The IGF-I concentrations in the follicular fluid of smaller follicles (diameter > 6 mm) were higher compared to those in the large follicles (diameter ≥6 mm).

Though, dairy farmers encounter various risks and uncertainties in conducting their business. The highest risk in milk supply lies in the activities at the farm. This study was designed to formulate a model for calculating milk price at farmer's level based on risk. Risks that occur on farms include the risk of cow breeding, sanitation, health care, cattle feed management, milking and milk sales. This research used the location of the farm in West Java region. There were five main stages in the preparation of this model, (1) identification and analysis of influential factors, (2) development of a conceptual model, (3) structural analysis and the amount of production costs, (4) model calculation of production cost with risk factors, and (5) risk based milk pricing model. This research built a relationship between risks on smallholder dairy farms with the production costs to be incurred by the farmers. It was also obtained the formulation of risk adjustment factor calculation for the variable costs of production in dairy cattle farm. The difference in production costs with risk and the total production cost without risk was about 8% to 10%. It could be concluded that the basic price of milk proposed based on the research was around IDR 4,250-IDR 4,350/L for 3 to 4 cows ownership.

All the isolates were initially screened for their fast growths in liquid medium and 13 isolates were selected for another screening process. Three SOB isolates namely isolate AH18, AH25, and AH28 were selected based on their abilities to grow faster, produce the highest sulphate ion and reducing the pH in the growth medium. The cells were Gram-negative and short rod-shaped. The effects of various variables including temperature (25-45 °C), pH (4-9), sodium thiosulphate concentrations (4-100 mM) and metabolic characteristic were evaluated on bacterial growth and their sulphur oxidation activities. The optimum pH of all the potential isolates occurred at pH 8.0. Meanwhile, the optimum temperature for isolate AH18, AH25 and AH28 occurred at 45 °C, 30 °C, and 30-45 °C, respectively.

The experiment was conducted with a completely randomized design with a 4 x 4 factorial arrangement. The first factor was the concentration of probiotic starter consisted of 4 lavels i.e., 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10% v/v. All probiotic concentrations used the same ratio of L. rhamnosus TW2 and L. plantarum TW14, i.e. 1:1. The second factor was the duration of ripening process consisted of 4 levels i.e., 0 (no ripening), 10, 20, and 30 days at 5°C. The observed variables were cheese chemical properties including water content, protein, fat, ash, pH, total titratable acidity (TTA), free fatty acids (FFA), and proteolysis profile. The results showed that addition of probiotic starter at a concentration of 5% mixture of L. rhamnosus TW2 and L. plantarum TW14 increased (P < 0.01) only on ash content. The duration of ripening process up to 30 d significantly increased (P < 0.01) protein and fat. Combination of probiotic starter concentrations and duration of ripening process increased (P < 0.01) fat and ash contents. Proteolysis profile showed that protein was degraded into 72 and 52kDa proteins, but no 17kDa protein was found in cheese ripened for 30 d. It is concluded that 30 d duration of ripening at 5°C was the main contributing factor to chemical characteristics of cheese including chemical properties, pH, TTA, FFA, and proteolysis profile of probiotic goat cheese, while the concentration of mixed probiotics affected ash content, TTA and FFA of cheese.","Characteristics; Cheese; Lactobacillus plantarum TW14; Lactobacillus rhamnosusTW2; Starter",,"Setyawardani, T.; Department of Animal Production, University of Jenderal Soedirman, Jalan Dr. Soeparno No. 60, Indonesia; email: trianasulistiono@gmail.com",,"Bogor Agricultural University",01260472,,,,"English","Media Peternakan",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018252114

Silage made with the use of liquid fermentation additive (FA) can be a solution for those problems. The use of different levels of FA and addition of Lactobacillus plantarum bacteria as well as formic acid were expected to improve the nutritive quality of napier grass silage. The first experiment was designed to measure the fermentative quality of napier grass silage. The treatments used were the levels of FA, L. plantarum, and formic acid supplementations. The experiment used a completely randomized design with a 3x2x2 factorial arrangement with 3 replications. The first factor was the level of liquid FA (5%, 7.5%, and 10%), and the second factor was the inoculation of L. plantarum (without and with inoculation of the L. plantarum), and the third factor was the addition of formic acid (without and with the addition of 0.15% formic acid). The second experiment was aimed to evaluate chemical and microbiological characteristics, and in vitro digestibility of selected napier grass silage. The results showed that napier grass silage from all treatments showed good qualities. There were interactions between FA, L. plantarum, and formic acid on DM content (P < 0.05) and ammonia production (P < 0.01). The use of FA showed an interaction (P < 0.01) with the addition of L. plantarum and formic acid in Fleigh point. Ammonia production in rumen (P < 0.01), total VFA (P < 0.05), and in vitro digestibility (P < 0.01) were significantly affected by the treatments. The optimal level of liquid FA was 7.5%. Based on the nutritive quality of silage, L. plantarum addition was as effective as control treatment to improve nutritive quality of napier grass silage through the increased of fermentation characteristics i.e., low pH, high DM product, high fermentation product (VFA), and digestible on rumen.

The samples were subsequently evaluated for their fermentation characteristics and digestibility by using a two-stage in vitro rumen fermentation technique, maintained at 39 °C for 2 × 48 h. The in vitro incubation was performed in three consecutive runs by following a randomized complete block design in which each sample per run was represented by four fermentation tubes. Results revealed that all experimental beans contained high crude protein (CP), i.e. above 200 g/kg dry matter (DM), but only soybean and groundnut had CP contents higher than 300 g/kg DM. Redbean had the lowest crude fiber and acid detergent fiber contents among the beans. Soybean contained high proportion of rapidly degraded CP fraction, but low in slowly degraded and unavailable CP fractions. High proportion of slowly degraded CP fraction was found in redbean and bambarabean.

The cultures of two probiotic bacteria AB and BC had been developed as well as three probiotic bacteria ABC culture. The mixed cultures (AB, BC and ABC) were prepared in single culture then cultivated in mixed culture as total 10% v/v of mare's milk used and was incubated at 39°C for 9 h. The pH, acidity and bacterial count, each of them was analyzed in every 3 h of incubation time, while the organic acid and sensory tests were conducted at the end of 9 h of incubation. The results showed that the growth of mixed probiotic bacteria culture BC and ABC had better pH value that was around 3 compared with AB around 4.5. This showed that the cooperation between bacteria was different in each different combinations.

The chicken stocking condition needs more attention as a part of animal welfare. This study was performed to identify the relationship between the stocking density and the stress based on Temperature Humidity Index (THI) and the effect of stocking density on meat quality, i.e., physical, microbiological, and organoleptic. Ninety DOCs of Kampong-Broiler (KB) were assigned into a completely randomized design with 3 treatments of stocking density i.e., 8, 10, and 12 birds/m2. Each treatment was replicated 3 times. The experimental chickens were housed in 9 blocks of housing each with 1 x 1 m2 size. Data on physical and microbiology of meat qualities were analyzed with analysis of variance and continued with Duncan's multiple range test. The organoleptic data were analyzed by using Kruskal-Wallis test. The result showed that the stocking density did not significantly affect the physical and hedonic quality of KB chicken's breast.

Results revealed that among the forages, cassava leaf had the highest proportion of NDICP while corn gluten feed was the highest among the concentrates. Different from that of NDICP, the highest proportion of ADICP was obtained in papaya leaf and copra meal for the forages and concentrates, respectively. Higher proportion of NDICP tended to decrease CPD (P < 0.1).

Meta-analysis was applied to 13 experiments and 42 treatments dealing with glycerol supplementation in ruminants. Data were analyzed by general linear model procedure in which the glycerol levels and the different studies were treated as fixed effects. Results revealed that glycerol supplementation did not affect the in vitro digestibility and total VFA production, but significantly decreased molar proportion of acetate and iso-valerate (P < 0.05). In contrast, molar proportion of propionate, butyrate, and valerate significantly increased, and thus the ratio of acetate to propionate declined linearly (P < 0.05). Methane production decreased linearly and accompanied with an increase of total gas production with increasing levels of glycerol supplementation (P < 0.05).

The eggs in this study were obtained from field laboratory of Faculty of Animal Science, Bogor Agricultural University (IPB) and classified in AA quality based on the interior quality. First attempt to purify the EWL was performed by using ethanol precipitation yielding purified EWL which was still contaminated by other proteins, hence designated as partially purified EWL. Final concentrations of partially purified EWL of kampung chicken, commercial laying hens, and Cihateup duck were about 5800, 5400, and 5500 μg/mL, respectively. To confirm whether the use of ethanol in the purification affecting EWL antibacterial activities, the activities were examined against Staphylococcus aureus. It demonstrated that the partially purified EWL exhibited ability to inhibit S. aureus at 6 and 26 h suggesting that the method was feasible as it did not interfere EWL antibacterial activities. Yet, based on SDS-Page, purity was the issue in ethanol precipitation method. Further attempt using ion exchange chromatography at pH 10 successfully purified lysozyme as indicated by a single band corresponding to lysozyme size (~14 kD) free from bands of other proteins.

This paper reports the application of corn-cattle based integrated farming system in Agrotechno Park Center of Palembang, and discusses its impact on CO2 fixation and the reduction of methane emissions. The study was based on the data of the first 6 yr from 2003 until 2009. The CO2 fixed in the soil and plants was determined based on the content of organic C which was multiplied by the index of 3.67. The methane gas produced by Balinese cattle and its dung was observed and modified into feed rations. The results showed that soil organic C increased from 40.80 tons C/ha in the 1st yr to 66.40 tons C/ha in the 6th yr. In addition, there was organic C fixation equivalent to 93.95 tons of CO2e. Corn biomass increased from 6.67 tons/ha to 18.66 tons/ha, equivalent to an increase in the fixation of atmospheric CO2e as much as 19.80 tons CO2e/ha. The supplementation of 60%-80% grass fodder with concentrate lowered the concentration of methane gas in cattle breathing by 28.7%, from 617 ppm to 440 ppm, while the methane emissions from cattle manure decreased by 31%, from 1367 mL/head/d to 943 mL/head/d. Installing a bio digester that generates biogas served to accommodate methane gas emissions from cattle dung and used it for bioenergy. Composting reduced the formation of methane gas from cattle manure through a regular process of turning over that gives aeration and forms aerobic condition in the heap of cattle dung. Recycling produces a variety of organic products that store carbon for a longer period of time and slowed the conversion of organic C into CO2. This study showed that the diverse activities of an integrated crop-cattle farming could be an alternative solution to climatic change mitigation.","Integrated farming; Methane; Mitigation; Organic C; Recycling",,"MunandarJalan Raya Palembang-Prabumulih Km. 32, Indonesia; email: munandar_mun@ymail.com",,"Bogor Agricultural University",01260472,,,,"English","Media Peternakan",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982153359

This research was aimed to evaluate the potency of swamp forage on digestibility and performance of goats. There were 24 local male goats aged 10-12 months with initial body weight of 13.10±1.55 kg, allocated into 6 treatments. Those were control (R0): 60% grass and 40% legumes; (R1): 60% swamp forages and 40% concentrate; (R2): 100% swamp forages; (R3): 100% swamp forage hay; (R4): 100% swamp forage silage; (R5): 100% haylage swamp forages. Results showed that silage treatment significantly increased (P<0.05) consumption and digestibility. Swamp forages could be utilized well by preservation (silage, hay, and haylage). Ensilage of swamp forages increased protein content from 13.72% to 14.02%, protein intake (74.62 g/d), dry matter intake (532.11 g/d), nitrogen free extract intake (257.39 g/d), with total body weight gain (3.5 kg) in eight weeks and average daily gain (62.60 g/d). It is concluded that ensilage of swamp forages (R4) is very potential to be utilized as forage source for ruminants such as goats.","Body weight; Goat; Haylage; Silage; Swamp forage",,"Rostini, T.; Graduate School, Bogor Agricultural University, Jln.

The housing design used to determine the broiler stocking density was based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with Solid Works Flow Simulation software. The method had good validation shown by small number of average percentage of deviation (6.07%). Simulation was carried out by changing the number of broilers i.e. 16, 18, 20, 21 and 22 birds/m2. According to the CFD simulation result, total heat load inside the house was 233.33 kW at 21 birds/m2 at weight 1.65 kg/bird. At that stocking density the housing can be occupied by 27,224 birds until 22 days of age. The highest total weight was produced by daily harvesting started from 22 to 32 d.

An alternative way to produce a good quality of mannooligosaccharides was through hydrolysis of glucomannan by endo-ß mannnase from actynomicetes. Based on 16S rRNA analysis, BF 3.10 isolate, isolated from Bukit Duabelas National Park soil, Jambi was identified as Streptomyces violascens BF 3.10. Reducing sugar was analyzed by dinitrosalicylic acid methods. The highest reducing sugar was achieved at the 72 hours of incubation. Mannanase of isolate BF 3.10 had the highest activity at pH 6 and temperature of 70 °C with enzyme activity of 16.38 U/mL and was stable at 4 °C for 48 h. During 5-hour of hydrolysis with substrate concentration of 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1% porang glucomannan dissolved in 10 mL enzyme, mannooligosaccharides were produced with the degree of polymerization of 2-3. Visualization of the products by using thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods showed that mannooligosaccharides produced comprised of glucose, mannobiose, mannotriose, and mannotetraose. The degree of polymerization and the simple sugars produced indicated that mannanase produced by S. violascens actively catalyzed the hydrolysis of 1.4-ß-D-mannoside linkage from ß-1.4-mannan backbone, that eventually produced simple sugars of mannooligosaccharides.","Glucomannan; Mannanase; Mannooligosaccharides; Porang; Streptomyces violascens",,"Meryandini, A.; Department of Biology, Faculty of Mathematic and Natural Sciences, Kampus IPB Darmaga, Indonesia; email: ameryandini@yahoo.com",,"Bogor Agricultural University",01260472,,,,"English","Media Peternakan",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982182121

The abatement mechanism of rumen CH4 emission may be divided to direct and indirect suppression to methanogens in the rumen. The most significant strategy to mitigate ruminal CH4 emission in indirect manner is to promote alternative metabolic pathway to dispose of the reducing power, competing with methanogenesis for H2 uptake. This includes prebiotics and probiotics (mostly propionate enhancers) which consume metabolic hydrogen (H2) compete with methanogens and abate rumen methanogenesis in indirect manner. With regard to mitigate GHG emissions from manure, such waste has been proposed as a renewable energy and nitrogen sources through biogas plant. Furthermore, in advanced new biogas system, the ammonia stripping from digested slurry of livestock manure in biogas plant has been examined to apply to nitrogen recycling-options mitigating N2O emission. These options are: (1) ammonolysis on fiber-rich feedstuffs, (2) saccharification of the NH3 treated cellulose biomass to produce bio-ethanol, and (3) reformed hydrogen into NH3 fuel cell to generate electricity with proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEM).","Ammonia stripping; Nitrous oxide; Prebiotics; Probiotics; Rumen methane",,"Takahashi, J.; Graduate School of Animal Science, Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary MedicineJapan; email: junichi@obihiro.ac.jp",,"Bogor Agricultural University",01260472,,,,"English","Media Peternakan",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982170209

However, location of the business, whether in lowland and upland areas was a significant factor that could increase the efficiency. Some factors that could significantly reduce the technical inefficiency of beef cattle business were: labor force in family, education level, proportion of beef cattle income to total household income, age of cattle sold, cattle health examination, ownership status of the cattle, and gender. Therefore, (1) the existing farmers group should be improved their role to facilitate trading of cattle feed, and (2) the government should facilitate the farmers in the provision of funding tu buy beef cattle with a subsidized interest rate, so the farmers will be more enthusiast in taking care of their cattle, thus could improve their production efficiency.","Beef cattle breeding; Maximum likelihood estimation; Stochastic frontier; Technical efficiency",,"Kalangi, L.S.; Faculty of Economics and Management, Graduate School, Bogor Agricultural UniversityIndonesia; email: lidya_kalangi@yahoo.com",,"Bogor Agricultural University",01260472,,,,"English","Media Peternakan",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982121500

Identification of selected LAB was based on 16S rDNA sequences, morphological and biochemical characteristics. Ninety five bacteria were isolated and characterized as lactic acid bacteria (Gram positive, catalase negative, non sporeforming and acid producing). Twenty four isolates of LAB demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli JCM 1649 and Salmonella enteritidis B2586, and three selected isolates, i.e. CCM011, CSP004, and CVM002 showed the highest inhibition activity. The isolates had characters of high cell surface hydrophobicity and inter-isolate coaggregation ability of LAB, high survival at low pH, high phytase and protease activity (but no amylase and lipase activity), weak coaggregation with pathogen and no resistance to the examined antibiotics. The isolates were identified based on sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene as Lactobacillus salivarius, however, each isolate had different profiles of sugar fermentation.

Ninety six Isa brown pullets aged 15 weeks were therefore used to assess the effect of supplementing commercial diets with plantain root base (PRA) and stalk ashes (PSA) on growth performance, carcass and organ characteristics of pullets during 4 weeks before point of laying (19 weeks of age) and 6 weeks of laying period (25 weeks of age). The pullets were divided into two groups of 48 each for supplementation with either PSA or PRA. Each group was divided into four groups of 12, which were further replicated 3 times with 4 birds per replicate in a completely randomized design. At each developmental stage, the feed offered to the birds was supplemented with 0 (control), 1, 2, and 3 g/kg body weight of PSA or PRA. One g/kgBW of PRA supplementation elicited observable growth performance effects on the birds, while for PSA it was 2 g/kgBW. The 2 g/kgBW PSA supplemented birds gained significantly (P<0.05) more weight than the other groups except the control, which consumed significantly (P<0.05) more feed. At point of laying, the 1g/kgBW PRA group recorded significantly (P<0.05) higher body weight and weight gain than the control. Plantain root base ash affected dressing percentage significantly (P<0.05) resulting in higher thigh weights, while organ weights decreased with increasing ash supplementation levels.

This experiment aimed to screen and identify indigenous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from rumen liquor and king grass (Pennisetum hybrid) silage as a probiotic candidate and to evaluate their resistance in low pH, and inhibitory activities against pathogenic bacteria. The LAB isolate was characterized by a clear zone formed on MRSA medium + CaCO3 0.2% (w/v) and further identified by morphological and biochemical assays. The selected isolates were evaluated for their viability in low pH, pathogenic bacterial inhibition, and lactic acid production. The experimental arrangement was a factorial block design (4 x 2) consisted of four isolates and two levels of pH value (pH 2 and 3), each treatment in 3 equal replicates. The result showed that four isolates (two isolates from the rumen liquor of fistulated cattle and two isolates from silage) were identified as lactic acid bacteria. The four isolates showed inhibition activity against Escherichia coli, Bacillus sub-tilis, Staphylococcus aureus and performed viability at low pH during 2 h treatment. The highest lactic acid production was obtained from isolates Sil.3 (21.42%) and followed by CR2 (19.88%), CR1 (15.40%) and Sil.9 (15.08%). Biochemical identification by standard of analytical profile index (API) 50 CHL kit showed that the selected isolates CR1 was Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei 3 (91.5%), L. paracasei ssp. paracasei 3 (76.5%), Sil.3 was Lactobacillus brevis (95.1%), and Sil.9 was Lactobacillus collinoides (92.5%). In conclusion, probiotic candidates isolated from rumen liquor are confirmed as L. paracasei ssp. paracasei (CR1 and CR2), while two other isolates from king grass silage are identified as L. brevis (Sil.3) and L. collinoides (Sil.9). L. brevis (Sil.3) and L. paracasei ssp. paracasei (CR1) has higher inhibition against pathogenic bacteria (E. coli, S. aureus, and B. subtilis) than L. paracasei ssp. paracasei (CR2) and L. collinoides (Sil.9).","Isolation; Pathogenic bacteria; Probiotic; Rumen liquor; Silage",,"Sofyana, A.; Division of Animal Feed and Nutrition, Center for Processes Development and Chemical Engineering (BPPTK), Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI, Jln.

In this study, 140 Jumbo 747 unsexed one-day old chicks were distributed randomly into 20 units of cages, each filled with 7 broilers. Twenty cages were assigned into 5 treatment groups, each treatment in 4 equal replicates. The treatments were as follows: A= E. coli infection (positive control), B= E. coli infection + bio additive, C= E. coli infection + probiotic, D= E. coli infection + antibiotic, E= No E. coli infection (negative control). A commercial corn-soybean-based broiler diet was formulated as the basal diets. The experimental period was 35 d and at 21st d of age the broilers were infected with E. coli except the E treatment. The result showed that bio additive administration (B) increased the final body weight (1,659.52 g) and body weight gain (1,616.81 g) and resulted in less FCR (1.87) among other treatments. The lowest mortality rate was recorded in B treatment (3.57%) and D treatment (3.57%). Probiotic (C treatment) and antibiotic (D treatment) decreased (P<0.05) meat pH and tenderness compared to other treatments. Meanwhile bio additive administration did not affect the meat quality (pH, cooking loss, water-holding capacity, tenderness, and fat) compared to positive and negative controls. The lowest meat cholesterol content was observed in B treatment (54.02 mg/100 g). It is concluded that bio additive administration on broiler infected with E. coli increased the broiler performance and decreased the meat cholesterol com-pared to other treatments.","Antibiotic; Bio additive; Broiler performance; E.coli; Probiotic",,"Istiqomah, L.; Research Unit for Processes Development and Chemical Engineering (UPT.BPPTK), Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) Jln.

In April 2009 midside cashmere samples were taken from a total of 168 male and female cashmere goats of 1, 2, 3, and 4 yr of age. The goats were randomly chosen from Raeini, Birjandi, and Nadoushan breeds respectively from Kerman, South Khorasan, and Yazd provinces. Cashmere yield (CY) was determined from the percentage of weight of dehaired cashmere to weight of shorn fibre. Cashmere fiber diameter was analyzed using a projection microscope instrument. A general linear model including sex and age as fixed effects and breed as random effect was used to analyze the data and measure the relationships between different cashmere characteristics and fleece attributes. The overall means ± standard deviations were for cashmere yield (CY) 51.4%±1.5%, mean fiber diameter (MFD) 18.7±0.2 μ, coefficient of variation of fiber diameter (CVFD) 19.1%±0.3% and staple length (SL) 42.8±1.6 mm. One year old goats had finer cashmere than older goats. CVFD were higher in males and CY and SL were higher in young animals. Iranian cashmere goat breeds have an excellent SL but are relatively coarse. Given the differences between goats there seems to be substantial scope to improve the commercial value of cashmere.","Cashmere; Fiber diameter; Goats; Staple length",,"Ansari-Renani, H.R.; Animal Science Research Institute, P.

Therefore, this research was carried out to analyze the capability of a bacterial isolate (A2 isolates) previously isolated from soils sample from around IPB campus to hydrolyze PKC. Based on 16S-DNA analysis, isolate A2 was identified as Brevibacillus borstelensis. Mannanase of A2 isolate had an optimum condition at 90 °C and pH 7. Mannanase activity of crude extracts using Locust Bean Gum (LBG) and PKC as substrates were 0.37U/mL and 0.032U/mL, respectively. However, the most favorable production of oligosaccharides based on the degree of polymerization was obtained after 72-h of incubation with the ratio of substrate:enzyme, 1.2:1, on 1.5% PKC as substrate. The manno-oligosaccharides prebio-tic obtained was found to interfere the growth of both lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus casei) and pathogenic microflora (Escherichia coli). E. coli apparently could not use this prebiotic as the carbon sources, in contrast to L. casei. Substitution of carbon source in medium with prebiotics reduced the capability of L. casei to produce organic acids.

This study was designed to evaluate the feed preference, nutrient consumption, age and morphometric of deer in relation to their velvet antler product (weigth and length) and quality (mineral and amino acids). Five stags with three ages classes were offered 3 combinations of 4 grasses in a captive area. Grasses were offered for 3 periods of 12 consecutive days during velvet antler growth period. Velvet antlers were harvested at 36 days old and analysed for their chemical content. The result showed that Timor deer had different preference to the grasses offered. Deer had a high preference on the combination of Pennisetum purpureum, Commelina benghalensis, Hierochloe horsfieldii, and Sorghum caudatum. High intake of grasses increased body weight. The regresion equation between the weight or length of velvet antler withage (year) and girth size (cm) were: Y (velvet antler weight)= 0.43 + 0.03 (age), r2= 0.99, P&lt;0.05, and Y (length of velvet antler) = 5.7 + 0.31 (girth size), r2= 0.99, P&lt;0.05.

As a consequently, a huge disparity of beef cattle deployment between regencies occur. The objectives of the research were: a) to analyze the level of Capacity of Increasing Beef Cattle Population (CIBCP) in each regency, and b) to analyze the priorities of each regency for the development of beef cattle. Methods of the research used maximum potential of land resources (MPLR) and maximum potential of householder (MPNH) equation to analyze the effectiveness of CIBCP for regency. This analysis used to analyze the capacity and priorities. To formulate the beef cattle development policies, analysis of the ratio of the density of population and livestock are used. Conclusions: (a) NTT has a very large capacity to increase beef cattle to about 3.2 times that of the current population (based on land and labor resources), with the existing technology and management. Regency areas with large land resources and labor generally have a large CIBCP. On the other hand, regions with large land resources but small labor resource (or vice versa), have a small CIBCP (depending on the most limited resources), and (b) Scale of the priority regions are not only dominated by the largest number of cows.

The study consisted of five dietary treatments of BLM level in concentrate feed, i.e., 0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, and 8% and four replicates of each treatment. The treatment diets together with napier grass in ratio of 40: 60 were fermented using rumen liquor. All treatments were examined their antibacterial activity before and after fermentation. After four hours fermentation, supernatant of each samples were analyzed for VFA, NH3, number of bacteria and protozoa. Dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) digestibility were analyzed after 48 h fermentation. The results showed that before fermentation, 8% BLM addition caused the bigest (P&lt;0.05) inhibition diameter of Staphylococcus spp. growth compared to other lower levels. However after fermentation there were no significant differences among the addition levels of BLM. Two per cent of BLM addition produced higher VFA (P&lt;0.05) than the other addition levels.

In this phase, a completely randomized design was used, with 4 treatments and 5 replications; 2) the second phase was on feeding management, a completely randomized design method (2 × 2) was used, including feed (guava and walnut leaves) as first factor, and the second factor was feeding times (3 and 4 times/day) with 5 replications. The results obtained from the first experiment showed that different duration of mating significantly (P<0.05) affected the number of eggs produced. Based on time efficiency 6 hours mating duration produced higher egg production (226 egg/cycle), as well as hatch-ability (95%) than those of other mating duration. In the second experiment, it was found that there was interaction between feed types and feeding frequencies which significantly (P<0.05) affected feed consumption, feed digestibility, body weight gain, diameter of larvae and mortality rate. In conclusion, the optimum and efficient duration sugested for mating is six hours resulting high egg production. The walnut leaves feed has better effect on the first and second instar of larvae, while the guava leaves affect the following instars.

This study used PCR-RFLP method by using HaeIII restriction enzyme. The enzyme cut the GHRH gene at nucleotides of GG|CC at the base positions of 118, 312, and 406 and produced 4 fragments of 118, 194, 94, and 45 bp respectively. Genotyping the GHRH gene produced two types of allele, namely A (312, 94, and 45 bp) and B (194, 118, 94, and 45 bp). These two alleles resulted in three types of genotype, namely AA (312, 94, and 45 bp), AB (312, 194, 118, 94, and 45 bp), and BB (194, 118, 94, and 45 bp). Frequency of the B allele was dominant to the A allele. Chi-Square analysis showed that all of HF dairy and beef cattle observed were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (X2 &lt; X2(0.05)).

This research was conducted experimentally with a randomized block design, with 7 treatments and 5 blocks. The treatments were: R0: dairy cow feed; R1: R0 + 1.5 ppm Cr + 0.3 ppm Se + 40 ppm Zn; R2: R1 + 1.8 g/kg methanol extract of lerak fruit meal (SRE); R3: R2 + 0.25 ppm of garlic extract (GE); R4: R2 + 0.50 ppm of GE; R5: R2 + 0.75 ppm of GE; R6: R2 +1.0 ppm of GE. The results showed that the supplementation of SRE alone or without GE did not affect the pH, however, it decreased crude fiber digestibility. The supplementations of SRE and GE, decreased crude fibre digestibility as much as 13.01% up to 16.6%. The supplementation of 1.8 g/kg SRE + 0.25 ppm GE in the dairy cattle diet was able to decrease ace-tate, protozoal population and increase propionate. The supplementation of 1.8 g/kg SRE and 0.25 ppm garlic represents the best combination for dairy cattle feed in improving ruminal fermentation based on feed digestibility, fermentation products, and rumen bacterial population.","Dairy cow; Garlic; Rumen microbes; Ruminal fermentation; Sapindus rarak",,"Prayitno, C.H.; Faculty of Animal Science, Jenderal Soedirman University, Jln.

Statistic multivariate that consist on principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) were used to evaluate the data. The results showed that lard and tallow can be differentiated using whole parameters electrical properties of materials. On the other hand, lard and palm oil can only be differentiated using part of the material electrical properties. Good performance of differentiation process was obtained using PCA model at 4.91 to 4.98 MHz. The first two components of PCA, which was derived from conductance, impedance and capacitance, contributed more than 90% of the total variances. CA showed that lard and tallow are different groups based on the Euclidean distance of each electrical properties.

In this study, 6 sheep with an average initial body weight of 12.67±0.81 kg were arranged in a completely randomized design with 2 treatments and 3 replications. The treatments were T0: basal diet (control) and T1: basal diet + POMC. The basal diet consisted of forage and concentrate (60:40) with dry matter of feed intake as much as 5% of body weight. Dose of POMC used in this study was 15 g/d/head. The POMC contained lactic acid bacteria, i.e. Lactobacillus sp. (1x108 cfu/g) and S. cereviseae incorporated with micromineral Co (2 ppm), Cu (100 ppm), Fe (2.5 ppm), I (110 ppm) and Mn (100 ppm). The experimental period lasted for 11 wk (1 wk for adaptation and 10 wk for data collection). Data were analyzed using t-Student statistical test to compare the treatments. The results showed that POMC administration did not affect the body weight gain (BWG) (7.46 kg) compared to control (7.13 kg) while concentrate consumption (26.9 kg) of POMC was lower than the control (28.6 kg). Meanwhile POMC administration did not affect the meat quality (pH, moisture, cooking loss and tenderness), whereas the meat cholesterol was lower (34.25 mg/100g) than the control (38.87 mg/100g). It is concluded that administration of probiotic lactic acid bacteria combined with organic minerals decreases concentrate consumption and thereby potentially increases the animals energy utilization efficiency. In addition, the treatment also decreases the meat cholesterol content of local sheep.","Lactic acid bacteria; Meat quality; Organic mineral; Sheep performance",,"Herdian, H.; Division of Animal Feed and Nutrition, Center for Processes Development and Chemical Engineering (BPPTK), Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI), Jln.

Vegetable waste was collected from local traditional market, consisted of corn husk, chinese cabbage and cabbage. Research was held in randomized block design consisted of six treatments with 3 replications. Treatments were (T1) vegetable waste + rice bran, (T2) vegetable waste + rice bran + rice straw, (T3) vegetable waste + onggok, (T4) vegetable waste + onggok + rice straw, (T5) vegetable waste + pollard, (T6) vegetable waste + pollard + rice straw. Lactobacillus plantarum 1A-2 was used as innoculant. The quality of silages was evaluated by measuring pH, temperature, population of lactic acid bacteria and lactic acid production. Nutrient characteristic was determined by proximate and fiber analysis. Results showed that pH of silages were not affected by treatments, but silage treated with rice bran, with or without rice straw addition, had higher temperature compared with others (29 °C or 28.3 °C). The highest population of lactic acid bacteria (1.65 x 109 cfu/g) was found in silage using rice straw and onggok (T4), but the highest lactic acid production (0.41%) was measured in silage using rice straw and rice bran (T2). In general, the use of rice bran as carbohydrate sources gave the highest lactic acid production followed by pollard and onggok. Different carbohydrate source gave different nutrients characteristic. Although the result was not significantly different, silage with highest protein content was measured in silage with pollard as carbohydrate source, followed with rice bran and onggok. The result showed that all carbohydrate sources used in this experiment can be used as silage ingredient resulting in good vegetable waste silage.","Lactobacillus plantarum 1A-2; Onggok; Pollard; Rice bran; Vegetable waste silages",,"Astuti, W.D.; Research Center for Biotechnology, Indonesian Institutes of Sciences (LIPI), Jln.

Data on animal live weight (LW), body length (BL), chest girth (CG) and body volume were collected from 221 stallions kept by traditional household farmers. Animal body volume was calculated using cylinder volume formula with CG and BL as the components of its formula. Regression analysis was carried out for LW with all the linear body measurements. The data were classified on the basis of age. Age significantly (P<0.05) influenced the body measurements except animal body length (Pgt;0.05). Animal live weight was predicted by simple regression models using dependent variable (Y) of the animal live weight and independent variable (X) of the animal body measurement, either body length, chest girth, or body volume. The correlations between all pairs of measurements were highly significant (P<0.01) for all age groups. Regression analysis showed that live weight could be predicted accurately from body volume (R2= 0.92) and chest girth (R2= 0.90). Simple regression model that can be recommended to predict horse live weight based on body volume with their age groups ranging from 3 to ≥10 years old was as follow: Live weight (kg)= 5.044 + 1.87088 body volume (liters). The analyses of data on horse chest girth, body length and body volume formula provided quantitative measure of body size and shape that were desirable, as they enable genetic parameters for these traits to be estimated and also included in breeding programs.","Body linear measurements; Live weight estimation; Minahasa local horse",,"Takaendengan, B.J.; Department of Animal Production, Faculty of Animal Science, Sam Ratulangi UniversityIndonesia; email: juvarda@yahoo.com",,"Bogor Agricultural University",01260472,,,,"English","Media Peternakan",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982083162

All the isolates showed multiple drug resistance to various antibiotics ranging from two to ten antibiotics. The resistance patterns were independent of serogroups of isolates and the animal species from which isolates were obtained. However, there was a variation in resistance pattern for same antibiotic vis-a vis locations of their isolation.","Animal neonates; Antibiogram; Diarrhoeic faeces; E. coli; Efficacy",,"Pachaury, R.; Department of Animal HusbandryIndia; email: pachaury.ruchi@gmail.com",,"Bogor Agricultural University",01260472,,,,"English","Media Peternakan",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982106499

However, the addition was only up to 10% of drinking water. The objective of this experiment was to study whether the addition of sugar and water extracted beluntas leaf in levels higher than 10% of drinking water can give greater benefit on performances and meat cholesterol content of broiler. Two hundred sixteen DOCs CP707 strain were reared for four weeks in high stocking density of 15 birds/m2. The birds were subjected to experimental drinking waters with or without water extracted beluntas leaf (v/v) and sugar which is consisted of T1 (only drinking water), T2 (drinking water + commercial antistress), T3 (drinking water + 10% extract of beluntas leaf), T4 (drinking water + 20% extract of beluntas leaf), T5 (drinking water + 40% extract of beluntas leaf), T6 (drinking water + 80% extract of beluntas leaf), T7 (drinking water + 40% extract of beluntas leaf + 1.6% sugar), and T8 (drinking water 80% extract of beluntas leaf + 3.1% sugar). The results showed that water extracted beluntas leaf addition higher than 10% significantly reduced (P&lt;0.05) body weight gain, final body weight, and increased (P&lt;0.05) feed conversion ratio. It is concluded that the addition of water extracted beluntas leaf more than 10% into drinking water cannot give greater benefit on performances as an antistress of broiler. Sugar addition cannot help the disadvantage due to the bitter taste of higher level of water extracted beluntas leaf addition.","Antistress; Broiler performances; Drinking water; Sugar cane; Water extracted beluntas leaf",,"Sudarman, A.; Department of Nutrition and Feed Technology, Faculty of Animal Science, Bogor Agricultural University, Jln.

This research used a completely randomized design with four treatments: A0 (without AMF), A1 (without AMF in drought), A2 (with AMF), and A3 (with AMF in drought) in S. seabrana. Parameters observed were the soil moisture content, water potential of shoot, relative water content of leaf (RWC), root length, shoot and root dry weight, proline, soluble sugars, crude protein, gas production, and digestibility of organic matter. The data were analyzed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the differences between treatments were analyzed with Duncan Multiple Range test. Results showed that inoculation of AMF could enhance leaf water potential, shoot and root dry weight, crude protein, gas production, digestibility of organic matter, but decreased proline and soluble sugars significantly (P<0.05).

The number of cattle used to determine growth traits of BW, WW, and YW were 235, 215, and 178 heads, respectively. Estimation of breeding value, phenotypic and genetic correlation were calculated by Restricted Maximum Likelihood and General Linier Model (GLM) procedures, respectively. Genetic trends analysis was performed using the regression mean breeding values on birth year. Phenotypic and genetic correlation among BW and WW were 0.10 and 0.08 respectively and 0.90 and 0.70 for WW and YW respectively. The phenotypic trends for traits of birth and weaning weight were constant, whereas yearling weight was fluctuating from 2000 to 2008. Likewise, in the case of genetic trends, the birth and weaning weight were constant from 2000 to 2008 except for WW in 2005, whereas the genetic trends for yearling weight showed a fluctuation of wide range. According to the breeding value estimated for all traits, the best was the sire No. 0565, whose breeding value for BW, WW and YW were +0.07, +2.79, and +10.25 kg, respectively higher than the mean value of the population. The genetic trends showed that there have been a significant and positive genetic improvement in all growth traits and indicate that selection would be effective. Genetic correlation between WW and YW was high (0.70) which indicates that the selection on weaning weight might also increase yearling weight in Bali cattle.","Bali cattle; Genetic trends; Growth traits",,"Gunawan, A.; Department of Animal Production and Technology, Faculty of Animal Science, Bogor Agricultural University, Jln.

In experiment 1, mixture of rice crop residue (RC), soybean curd residue (SC) and cassava waste (CW) in a 80: 10: 10 (on dry matter basis) ratio was used as silage material. Four treatments silage were (A) RC + SC + CW as a control; (B) RC + SC + CW + LAB inoculant from king grass (2%, v/w); (C) RC + SC + CW + LAB inoculant from king grass (3%, v/w); (D) RC + SC + CW + L. plantarum inoculant (2%, v/w). In experiment 2, six Kacang goats were used in a 6 × 3 Youden square experiment and fed elephant grass, rice straw, and rice crop residue-based silage. The results showed that crude protein (CP) content in silages B, C, and D was slightly higher than silage A. Lactic acid concentration was significantly higher (P<0.01) in silages B and C compared to silage D. The pH value of control silage (A) was higher (P<0.05) than silage treated with LAB inoculant. Rice crop residue-based silage had higher (P<0.01) digestibility of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), and CP than rice straw. It was concluded that addition of epiphytic LAB inoculant from king grass to rice crop residue resulting in a good fermentation quality of silage compared to addition of L. plantarum inoculant.","Digestibility; Lactic acid bacteria; Rice crop residue; Silage",,"Santoso, B.; Department of Animal Nutrition, Faculty of Animal Science, Fishery and Marine Science, State University of PapuaIndonesia; email: santosob@lycos.com",,"Bogor Agricultural University",01260472,,,,"English","Media Peternakan",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982179470

The two genes are involved in immunity where they play a crucial role in pathogens recognition and presentation to T-cells and CD4 cells. PCR was used to amplify genomic DNA for TLR4 (382 bp) and CaLA-DRB (285 bp) genes fragments. Genetic polymorphism was detected by digesting TLR4 amplimer with AluI while DRB amplimers were digested with PstI and TaqI in two separate reactions. The results showed that TLR4|AluI was monomorphic and fixed with allele T in all three breeds while DRB|TaqI and DRB|PstI loci were found polymorphic for all breeds. Heterozygosity expected (He) and PIC were found low at both DRB|TaqI and DRB|PstI loci in PE and Saanen.

The experiment was aimed to apply the artificial insemination (AI) technique for anoa and to examine their parturition behavior. The experiment involved 2 males and 5 females anoa at Taman Safari Indonesia Bogor. Semen was collected by electroejaculator, then evaluated and diluted in Tris-egg yolk extender. The anesthetized estrous females were inseminated intracervically with extended semen (100x106 sperm/1.0 mL). Females which did not show estrous signs during 2-3 cycles after AI were predicted pregnant, and therefore confirmed by ultrasonography. As a comparison, another predicted-pregnant female after natural mating was scanned. The results showed that intracervical AI resulted pregnancy in one female, and the gestation period of anoa was ranged from 313 d (AI) to 324 d (natural mating). There were three stages of parturition process was observed: Stage 1 was characterized by the abdominal contraction and amniotic membrane rupture, Stage 2 was characterized by the fetal expulsions, and Stage 3 was characterized by the placental expulsions and ingestion of placenta by the dam. The duration of each stage of parturition was 6-8 h (stage 1), 30-60 min (stage 2), and 15-180 min (stage 3). It is concluded that AI technique was applicable to anoa in captivity, and the parturation behavior of anoa was comparable to buffalo and cattle.

The diets were in mash form and placed in sufficient feed troughs in front of each cage. Each cage was occupied by four or six hens. Free choice feeding hens were served with commercial concentrate (30% crude protein), ground corn and oyster shell, placed separately in feed troughs. Observation was carried out during 24 weeks laying period, starting from 20 to 44 weeks of age. The results showed that egg production (9.35% hen day), and the intake of feed (42.74 g/day), protein (7.01 g/day), energy (116.6 kcal ME/day), calcium (1.99 g/day and phosphorus (0.22 g/day) were not affected (P>0.05) by feeding system nor by cage density. The results however indicated that free choice feeding technique provided sufficient nutrients in supporting maximum egg production of unselected native chicken.","Cage density; Free choice; Laying; Wareng chicken",,"Iskandar, S.; Indonesian Research Institute for Animal Production (IRIAP), P.O.

The objective of this research was to identify genetic polymorphisms in the entire exon 6 of calpastatin gene in Indonesian local sheep. A PCR-SSCP method was carried out to identify genetic variation of CAST gene. In total 258 heads of local sheep from 8 populations were investigated, three groups of samples were Thin Tail Sheep (TTS) from Sukabumi, Jonggol, and Kissar. The rest samples were Priangan sheep (PS) from Margawati (Garut meat type) and Wanaraja (Garut fi ghting type) and Fat Tail Sheep (FTS) from Donggala, Sumbawa, and Rote islands. SSCP analysis revealed that three different SSCP patterns corresponded to three different alleles in the CAST locus (CAST-1, 2, and 3 allele) with fi ve diff erent genotypes. Genetic variation between local sheep populations were calculated based on genotypic and allelic frequencies. Most populations studied were polymorphic, with genotype frequencies of CAST-11, CAST-12, CAST-22, CAST-32, and CAST-33 were 0.286, 0 395, 0.263, 0.046, and 0.007 respectively. CAST-1 and 2 alleles were most commonly found in all populations with total frequency was 0.970, while CAST-3 was a rare allele 0.030 and only found in TTS population. Variation in the CAST gene could be used for the next research as genetic diversity study or to fi nd any association between CAST polymorphism with birth weight, growth trait and carcass quality in Indonesian local sheep.","Calpastatin; Exon 6; Indonesian local sheep; PCR-SSCP",,"Dagonga, M.I.A.; Animal Production and Technology Study Program, Postgraduate School, Bogor Agricultural UniversityIndonesia; email: iccangdagong@yahoo.com",,"Bogor Agricultural University",01260472,,,,"English","Media Peternakan",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982107487

Each dietary treatment was fed to 4 birds in individual wire cage and replicated 5 times. The trial was performed for 10 weeks and egg production, egg weight, feed intake was measured. At the end of feeding period, manure was collected and analyzed for moisture content while samples of eggs were measured for yolk color and the yolk was analyzed for xanthophyll level. Result showed that feeding Lopro DDGS, Hipro DDGS, and CGM did not affect egg production (egg mass, egg number, and egg weight), however, feeding DDGS resulted in less feed intake (111 g/day) compared to feeding CGM (114 g/day). Feeding DDGS up to 16% did not affect egg production and similar to feeding CGM up to 8%. Feeding high level of DDGS or CGM did not significantly affect the moisture content of excreta which were between 78.1%-81.9%. Increasing levels of DDGS or CGM increased yolk color score related to the higher level of xanthophylls content in egg yolk. The coloring ability of CGM to egg yolk was higher than that of DDGS. In conclusion, DDGS can be fed to layer up to 16% without affecting egg production while CGM can be fed up to 8% in the diet.

First experiment examined three carbohydrate sources (cassava meal, pollard and coarse grinding corn) for their capacities to improve physical (color, odor, texture and spoilage), fermentative (pH, protein degradation, organic acid profiles), and utilities characteristics of the silages for ruminants (rumen fermentabilities and digestibilities) in vitro. The silages had bright greenish brown of color, lactic acid odor, and firm textures, categorized as highly fermentable and digestible feeds (dry matter digestibility >72%). Compare to other additives, cassava meal produced better silage. However, high butyric acid and protein degradation proportions in the silage were not seem in line to these data. Coarse grinding corn failed to do its function therefore produced poor silage quality. Second experiment was designed to confirm the previous results. Five carbohydrate sources (cassava meal, pollard, fine grinding corn, rice bran, and cassava extract meal) of the same functions were examined. The results confirmed that cassava meal produced very good ramie leave silages (Fleigh number >80) while the others produced quite good ramie leaves silage qualities (Fleigh number 40-60).

The analysis result showed that two factors namely type of poultry and the role of poultry farm on household income had signifi cant influence on farmer's decision to implement HPAI vaccination. In fact, the implementation of HPAI vaccination would be more effective in independent farms since the risk of this disease was single-handedly borne by farmers. Apart from that, the implementation of HPAI vaccination would also be more effectivein farms that had never been infected by HPAI, particularly layer farms.

The rumen fluid was collected from two rumen fistulated Ongole Crossbred Cows of 306 and 333 kg body weight (BW). The cows were fed 3% of BW consisted of 70% napier grass and 30% concentrate. At the end of 30 days feeding, faecal solution was made out of 350 g fresh faeces dissolved in 1 l of each solvent, homogenized using blender for 30 second, while rumen liquor were collected directly from fi stula. After straining with four layers of cheesecloth both faecal solution and rumen liquid were mixed with artificial saliva (1:4 v/v).

Feed restriction was applied from 7 to 14 days of age. The experiment was arranged as a completely randomized design with 5 treatments and 6 replications. The results showed that feed intake and body weight gain of chickens submitted to early feed restriction on P-1, P-2, P-3 and P-4 were signifi cantly lower (P&lt;0.05) than that of chicken fed control diet. During realimentation period, body weight gain of chicken given P-1 and P-2 was lower (P&lt;0.05) than those obtained from P-3, P-4 and P-0 from 14 to 28 days of age. Compensatory growth only occur during the 28 to 35 days of age on P-4 and had similar performance with control at age of 42 days. It was concluded that energy restriction 2.25xBW0.67EM kcal/day for 7 days (7 to 14 days of age) with supplementation of probiotic B. circulans and Bacillus sp. (P-4) during realimentation period showed similar compensatory growth and body weight, but production index and feed cost better than control.","Feed restriction; Probiotic; Realimentation",,"Azis, A.; Jurusan Produksi Ternak Fakultas Peternakan Universitas Jambi Kampus Pinang MasakIndia; email: azis.abdul601@yahoo.co.id",,"Bogor Agricultural University",01260472,,,,"Indonesian","Media Peternakan",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982167131

Apart from the lactose (Gal(β1-4)Glc; Gal, D-galactose; Glc, D-glucose), the rest of carbohydrate components is composed of variety of sugars, commonly named as milk oligosaccharides. Human mature milk and colostrum contain 12 ~ 13 g/l and 22 ~ 24 g/l of oligosaccharides, respectively. In contrast, bovine colostrum contains more than 1 g/l oligosaccharides and this concentration rapidly decreases after 48 hr post partum. Most of human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) are resistant to digestion and absorption within the small intestine. Therefore they can reach the infant colon, where they can act as prebiotics that stimulate the growth of beneficial microorganisms such as various species of Bifidobacterium. They can also act as receptor analogues that inhibit the attachment of pathogenic microorganisms to the infant's colonic mucosa. A small part of the milk oligosaccharides is absorbed intact into the circulation and it has been hypothesized that these may act as immunomodulators. Generally, the bovine milk oligosaccharides are believed not to be absorbed by human adults or infants, thus making them available to be utilized as prebiotics or anti-infection materials. The colostrum of cows and other domestic farm animals is a potential source of free oligosaccharides, and oligosaccharides isolated from these natural sources can be utilized as functional foods or animal feedstuffs on the industrial scale.","Bifidobacterium; Milk; Oligosaccharides; Prebiotic",,"Urashima, T.; Graduate School of Animal Husbandry, Animal and Food Hygiene Program, Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, Obihiro Shi Inada Cho Nishi 2-11, Japan; email: urashima@obihiro.ac.jp",,"Bogor Agricultural University",01260472,,,,"English","Media Peternakan",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982170246

A total of 19 studies from published papers and own previously unpublished studies comprising of 100 treatments were pooled in a database. The database was segregated into two categories based on different methods or systems where the experiments were carried out, i.e. in vitro (6 studies, 65 treatments) and in vivo experiments (13 studies, 35 treatments). Mixed model effects were applied to the data; different studies were treated as random effects whereas dietary CT (continuous predictor variable) was treated as fixed effects. The results showed that in the in vitro studies, organic matter digestibility (OMD) decreased linearly (P=0.002) as CT concentration in feed increased. Likewise, such linear decrease of OMD at increasing CT was observed in the in vivo studies (P<0.001) as well as crude protein digestibility (CPD, P<0.001). The variation on in vitro OMD was higher at lower level of CT. Nitrogen retention was not significantly affected by CT level. It was concluded that CT reduced nutrient digestibility in ruminants, but its effect on N retention was unclear from the present study.","Condensed tannin; Meta-analysis; Nitrogen digestion; Ruminant",,"Jayanegara, A.; Department of Nutrition and Feed Technology, Faculty of Animal Science, Bogor Agricultural University, Jln.

The bark contains high level of tannin but the tannin has not been extracted or produced commercially. Tannin isolate can be used for several purposes such as tanning agent for leather, adhesive for plywood or particle board, etc. In ruminant, tannin can be detrimental but can also be beneficial. This experiment was aimed of getting the highest yield of tannin extract with the highest biological activity in rumen fermentation. Nine different solvents at different temperatures were used to extract tannin from A. mangium bark. The extracts were analyzed for their tannin contents and biological activities. Tannin content was analyzed using folin ciocalteau and butanol-HCl methods. Biological activity was described as a percentage of an increase in gas production in the in vitro rumen-buffer fermentation, with and without addition of PEG. The results show that Na2SO3 solution extracted more tannin than other solutions and the higher the concentration of Na2SO3 solution, the higher the yield of tannin extract. The solution of 6% sodium sulphite gave the highest yield of tannin extract (31.2% of original bark sample) and the highest concentration of tannin (18.26%) but produced a negative effect on in vitro fermentation (% increase of gas production = 2.70%). Extraction with 50% acetone gave a high yield of extract (22.28% of original bark) which contained 12.98% of tannin and showed the highest biological response (% increase of gas production = 216%). In conclusion, sodium sulphite solution is not recommended for tannin extraction if the tannin will be used as feed additive in ruminant feed; on the other hand, the aqueous acetone (50% acetone) solution is a better choice to be used.","Acacia mangium bark; Biological activity; Extraction; Tannin",,"Wina, E.; Indonesian Research Institute for Animal Production (Balitnak), P.O.

Broilers were tested their antibody to S. pullorum by agglutination test before the chickens were infected at 22 days of age. Treatment consisted of control without FA (R0), control with antibiotic (R1), FA contain 25% earth worm meal/EWM (R2), FA contain 50% EWM (R3), FA contain 75% EWM (R4), and FA contain 100% EWM (R5) which were periodically fed to broilers every three days at seventh days before and 10 days atter infection. Treatments were arranged on completely randomized design with five treatments and four replications of four broilers each. Broilers given FA had significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased body weight gain and improved feed conversion ratio. Broiler treated with FA containing 25% EWM (R2) improved feed utilization compared to R1, R3, and control. Histopathology analysis showed that broilers treated with FA could reduce viscera's necrosis, especially in the liver and intestine. Lesions found in broilers which were infected S. pullorum, could be reduced by FA treatment. It is concluded that EWM can be used as feed additive to improve broilers performance.","Broilers; Feed additive; Histopathology; Lumbricus rubellus; Salmonella pullorum",,"Sofyan, A.; Bagian Pakan dan Nutrisi Ternak, UPT.

The cheap price of imported leg quarters reduces the competitiveness of the local broilers. Therefore, an effort to increase production efficiency is needed through integration between broiler raising and corn farmers and feed producers (integrated farming). The purpose of this study is to analyze the feasibility of integrating broiler raising with corn cultivation and feed production. Besides that, a simulation was conducted to analyze the effects of DOC price changes, broiler price and production capacity. The analyses showed that integrated farming and a mere combination between broiler raising and feed factory of a 10,000 bird capacity is not financially feasible. Increasing the production to 25,000 broiler chickens will make the integrated farming financially feasible. Unintegrated broiler raising is relatively sensitive to broiler price decreases and DOC price increases compared to integrated farming.","Broilers; Fi nancial feasibility; Integrated farming",,"Firdaus, M.; Faculty of Economics and Management, Bogor Agricultural University, Jln.
