The objectives of this study were to develop in vitro selection method using culture filtrates of S. rolfsii, identify culture filtrate-insensitive somatic embryo (SE) of peanut after in vitro selection and regenerate peanut R0 lines originated from culture filtrate-insensitive SE. To achieve these objectives, peanut embryogenic tissues were cultured on selective medium containing various concentrations of S. rolfsii culture filtrates and sublethal concentration of the filtrates. Medium containing sublethal level of S. rolfsii culture filtrates was used to identify culture filtrate-insensitive SE of peanut. Subsequently, the selected SEs were germinated, plantlets were regenerated and preliminary tested against S. rolfsii. Results of the experiments showed that addition of S. rolfsii culture filtrates into medium for inducing peanut somatic embryos drastically reduced their growth and proliferation. S. rolfsii culture filtrates at 10% concentration has significantly reduced the number of proliferated SE per explant. However, sublethal level was achieved at 30% of culture filtrates concentration. Responses of five peanut cultivars against 30% of culture filtrates were similar, indicating they were similar in their susceptibility against S. rolfsii. A number of culture filtrate-insensitive SE were identified after culturing 1500 clumps of embryogenic tissue of peanut cv.

A total of 483 individuals belonging to 15 population breeds and 43 individuals belonging to 6 populations of jungle fowl (2 populations of Gallus gallus and 4 populations of Gallus varius) were sampled. The hypervariable I (HVI) segment of the D-loop was PCR amplified and subsequently sequenced. The sequences of the first 397 nucleotides were used for analysis. Sixty nine haplotypes were identified from 54 polymorphic sites with polymorphism between nucleotides 167 and 397 contributing to 94.5% of the sequence variation. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Indonesian indigenous chickens can be grouped into five distinct clades (clade I, II, IIIc, IIId, and IV) of the previously identified seven clades (clade I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IIIc, IIId, and IV) in Asian indigenous chickens. Fifty haplotypes belong to clade II, seven haplotypes are in clade IV, six are in clade IIId, three are in clade I and one haploype is in clade IIIc. There was no breed-specific clade. Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) based on partial D-loop sequences of Indonesian chicken indicates that 67.85% of the total sequence variation between haplotypes was present within the population and 32.15% between populations. One of the haplotypes (represented by PLC4) was shared by all populations, suggesting that these populations may share the same maternal ancestor. These results show a high mitochondrial D-loop diversity and indicate multiple maternal origins for Indonesian indigenous chickens. © 2008 Institut Pertanian Bogor","D-loop; haplotype; Indonesian indigenous chicken; mitochondrial DNA; phylogenetic analysis and clade",,"SULANDARI, S.R.I.; Research Center for Biology-LIPI, Cibinong Science Center, Widyasatwaloka Building, Jalan Raya Jakarta Bogor Km. 46, Indonesia; email: ssulanda@yahoo.co.id",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

One of the most common medicinal plant from Indonesia is red ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.). Nevertheless, limited studies of endophytic fungi associated with these medicinal plants are hitherto available. The objectives of this research were to study the diversity of endophytic fungi on red ginger and to analyze their potential as a source of antifungal agent. All parts of plant organs such as leaf, rhizome, root, and stem were subjected for isolation. Fungal identification was carried out by using a combination of morphological characteristic and molecular analysis of DNA sequence generated from ITS rDNA region. Thirty endophytic fungi were successfully isolated from leaf, rhizome, root, and stem of red ginger plant. Antagonistic activity was tested against Fusarium oxysporum, a pathogenic fungus on plants, using an antagonistic assay. Based on this approach, the fungi were assigned as Acremonium macroclavatum, Beltraniella sp., Cochliobolus geniculatus and its anamorphic stage Curvularia affinis, Fusarium solani, Glomerella cingulata and its anamorphic stage Colletotrichum gloeosporoides, Lecanicillium kalimantanense, Myrothecium verrucaria, Neonectria punicea, Periconia macrospinosa, Rhizopycnis vagum, and Talaromyces assiutensis. R. vagum was found specifically on root whereas C. affinis, L. kalimantanense, and M. verrucaria were found on stem of red ginger plant. A. macroclavatum was found specifically in red ginger plant's organ which located under the ground, whereas C. affinis was found from shoot or organ which located above the ground. The antagonistic activity of isolated endophytic fungi against F. oxysporum varied with the inhibition value range from 1.4 to 68.8%. C. affinis (JMbt7), F. solani (JMd14), and G. cingulata (JMr2) had significantly high antagonistic activity with the value above 65%; and R. vagum (JMa4) and C. geniculatus (JMbt9) had significantly low antagonistic activity with the range value 0-10%. © 2013 Institut Pertanian Bogor","antagonistic activity; biodiversity; endophytic fungi; medicinal plant; Zingiber officinale",,"SUKARNO, N.; Department of Biology, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Bogor Agricultural University, Darmaga Campus, Indonesia; email: nampiahsukarno@yahoo.com",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

Even though the potential use of bioactive compounds from T. flagelliforme is very high, its genetic variation in Indonesia is low. Gamma irradiation can be used to increase genetic variation. The objective of this research was to obtain the first generation mutants (M1) of T. flagelliforme resulting from gamma irradiation of normal mother plantlets with different plant height and number of shoots. T. flagelliforme was irradiated at the doses of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 Gy. The percentage of plant death was then calculated to determine the Lethal Dose (LD) 50. T. flagelliforme was then re-irradiated at LD50 dose to obtain M1 mutant. The plant height and number of shoots variation was observed after eight weeks of culture. The analysis of T. flagelliforme radiosensitivity resulted in LD50 at 25 Gy. Observation at six weeks after irradiation showed significant differences between the normal mother plant, 20 Gy mutants, and 25 Gy mutants with an average plant height of 9.57, 3.41, and 2.43 cm respectively, and the average number of shoots produced was 7.85, 6.03, and 5.00 shoots respectively. Irradiation at 20 and 25 Gy produced 49 and 37 mutant plantlets.

To accomplish and improve the effectiveness of virus management, we used root-colonizing bacteria (rhizobacteria) isolated from healthy hot pepper. Eight rhizobacteria isolates were selected and their capacity in enhancing plant growth and inducing systemic resistance (ISR) against TMV in greenhouse trials were evaluated. The rhizobacteria was applied as seed treatment and soil drench. Bacterized-seedling showed a better growth vigor, fitness and a milder symptom than non-bacterized control plants. The protective effect of rhizobacteria was more pronounced after challenging inoculation by TMV, especially for plants treated by isolates I-6, I-16, and I-35.

We measured photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, leaf temperature, chlorophyll content, N and P uptake, plant growth parameters and yield for those comparison. SRI methods significantly increased both vegetative and reproductive (generative) parameters of rice plants compared to conventional cultivation methods. Photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll content, N and P uptake under SRI cultivation were significantly higher compared to those of the conventional rice cultivation, but no differences were found in transpiration rate and leaf temperature. With SRI method, plants in their generative phase (especially in the grain-filling phase) had the highest photosynthetic and the lowest transpiration rates.

Probiotics must survive in gastric acids to reach the small intestine and colonize the host for appropriate prevention and management of several gastrointestinal diseases. To improve the survival rates of probiotic microorganisms during gastric transit, microencapsulation is considered to be a promising process. A variety of polymers are commonly used for microencapsulation. Thus, there is a widespread interest in the improvement of the physical and mechanical stability of the polymers use in probiotics encapsulation. In addition, there is a developing trend toward the use of milk proteins as encapsulation device. To fulfill many demands of a successful probiotics encapsulation, different techniques have been applied to increase the resistance of these sensitive microorganisms against gastric conditions.

The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profile based on 16S rRNA gene showed that the diversity of actinomycetes in roots was higher than soil samples. The profile also showed that the diversity of actinomycetes was similar in four varieties of rice plant and three types of agroecosystem. The profile was partially sequenced and compared to GenBank database indicating their identity with closely related microbes. The blast results showed that 17 bands were closely related ranging from 93% to 100% of maximum identity with five genera of actinomycetes, which is Geodermatophilus, Actinokineospora, Actinoplanes, Streptomyces and Kocuria. Our study found that Streptomyces species in soil and roots of rice plants were more varied than other genera, with a dominance of Streptomyces alboniger and Streptomyces acidiscabies in almost all the samples. Bacterial community analyses based on nifH gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that diversity of bacteria in soils which have nifH gene was higher than that in rice plant roots.

The plant has high medical potential and is effective to cure cancer. However, the low level of its genetic variation limits its exploration for desirable traits. The low level of genetic variation in Rodent tuber is mainly due to its asexual reproduction system. It usually reproduces vegetatively via tuber separation. Therefore, gamma irradiation had been applied to rodent tuber in vitro to increase its genetic diversity. The objective of this study was to analyze the genetic diversity of the first generation (MV1) of gamma irradiated rodent tuber mutant using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers.

A large mud tidal flat with a productive ecosystem found along the western shoreline of the sea makes this area ideal as a major production site of nori (Porphyra yezoensis) in Japan. We determined the independent effect of temperature, salinity, ammonium concentration and pH on nitrification rates (NR) in the Ariake seawater above the mud sediment. The NR was determined by measuring accumulation of NO2-N production after adding sodium chlorate, an inhibitor of NO2-N to NO3-N oxidation. NRs were relatively high at 20-35 °C (optimum at 29.5 °C), but the rates were very low at 5, 10, and 40 °C. NRs increased sharply when increasing the salinity from 13 to 20 ppt, but it decreased drastically at salinity levels more than 35 ppt (optimum at 19 ppt). The relationship between ammonium concentration and NR showed a typical kinetic curve of enzymatic reaction with the maximum NR (Vmax) of 0.029 µM N.h−1 at 200 µM NH4-N (the half saturation constant (Ks) = 35 µM NH4-N). High NRs were determined at pH 7.5-8.0 (optimum pH 7.8).

Results showed that strains, media, and duration of fermentations gave significant effect on the amount of pigment produced. Strain AKII produced highest concentration of angkak pigments. The combination of rice (White IR-42 and red rice BP-1804-IF-9) produced the highest pigment than the individual white and red rie it self. The optimum duration of fermentation was 16 days for strains AKI and AKII, but only 15 days for strain 915.

However, species in urban tropical habitats remain poorly studied, despite their abundance and potentially important roles in urban ecosystems and pest dynamics. We investigated the ant fauna of Bogor and its surroundings to contribute to the characterization of the myrmecofauna of one of Southeast Asia's most densely populated regions. Ants were collected both by hand collection and from honey baits in the most common habitats: garbage dumps, households, and home gardens. In total, 94 species were recorded, over two thirds of which occurred in home gardens, which underlines the importance of vegetated habitats for urban planning to support complex ant assemblages. Twelve sampled species are well-known as tramp species that occur primarily in human-dominated landscapes. The two tramp species Anoplolepis gracilipes and Paratrechina longicornis dominated ant assemblages in all locations and most habitat types. The assemblages of tramp species were affected by habitat type, whereas that of non tramp species were not. Forty-five species were also recorded in the Bogor Botanical Garden and five species are also known to be common in cacao agroforests. Hence, research in urban tropical habitats can increase our knowledge of the occurrence of ant species, allowing us to better assess the biodiversity and conservation potential of semi-natural habitats. © 2008 Institut Pertanian Bogor","ants; biotic homogenization; invasive species; tramp species; urban habitats",,"RIZALI, A.; Indonesian Nature for Conservation Foundation (INCF), Peka Indonesia Foundation, Kompleks IPB Sindang Barang II, Jalan Uranus Blok H No.1, Indonesia; email: a_rizali@peka-indonesia.org",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

However, this agent can cause various systemic side effects including cognitive impairments in chronic use. Brain damage due to DOX is caused by an increase of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) level in the brain. Increased TNF-α can further lead to chronic inflammation which can lead to neuronal deaths or neurodegenerative diseases. Mangiferin (MAG), a compound extracted from Mangifera indica, has been found neuroprotective activities, but its effect on DOX-induced brain damage is unknown. This study aims to determine the effect of MAG on brain damage induced by DOX. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were induced by DOX intraperitoneally. MAG was given orally at the doses of 30 and 60 mg/kg bw for 7 consecutive weeks. The parameters measured were inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in brain tissue. Coadministration of MAG with DOX reduced inflammation which was marked by the reduction of TNF-α mRNA expression, decreased TNF-α level and reduction of oxidative stress marked by increase of superoxide dismutase level and decrease of malondialdehyde level.

To date, simple markers based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery to evaluate eating quality of cooked rice are still limited. Thus, the aims of this study were to develop PCR-based markers, called SNAP (single nucleotide amplified polymorphism) as alternative markers of cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence/derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS/dCAPS). Four primer pairs specific to targeted alleles (CAPS/dCAPS and SNAP) of four loci were successfully designed based on the discovered SNPs according to the eating quality-QTL and searching genomic database. The primer pairs were able to identify alleles corresponding loci among indica and japonica varieties with diverse palatability (overall eating quality). There was consistent allele pattern produced by SNAP and CAPS/dCAPS for the same base mutation. The SNAP marker for rice eating quality trait could be easily assayed by standard agarose gel electrophoresis, allowing to increase the advantage of genotyping methods. Moreover, the SNAP markers together with our previous developed markers which were recommended as applicable marker set for evaluation of rice eating quality, will facilitate as marker-assisted selection for rice breeding program. © 2013 Institut Pertanian Bogor","CAPS; dCAPS; rice eating quality; SNAP; SNP",,"KOH, H.J.; Indonesian Center for Agricultural Biotechnology and Genetic Resources Research and Development, Jalan Tentara Pelajar No. 3A, Indonesia; email: heejkoh@snu.ac.kr",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

An antiplatelet agent is a compound which decreases platelet aggregation and inhibits thrombus formation. The objectives of this study were to determine the class of compound employing phytochemical assay and to determine the in vitro antiplatelet activity of four fraction, namely hexane, ethyl acetate, butanol, and water fractions of velvet bean seeds (Mucuna pruriens L.) using epinephrine (EPN) as agonist of platelet aggregation. The antiplatelet activities were tested in human platelet rich plasma with hyperaggregation. To determine the activities, EPN was arranged at 4 level of concentrations (300, 150, 75, and 30 ì M), and antiplatelet agents were at 500 µg/ml. The results indicated that ethyl acetate, butanol and water fraction contained high flavonoids and moderate phenols. The water, butanol and ethyl acetate fractions of velvet bean seeds exhibited potential inhibition of EPN-induced platelet aggregation at all concentrations. The strongest antiplatelet agent was water fraction and had the same antiplatelet activity as aspirin at level 150, 75, and 30 ì M of EPN.

At least four different shell forms were found including shells with characters of flowing-water species. Young mussels had distinctive “wings” at dorso-posterior part of the shells and in most cases, as the shells grew bigger, the wing development was less obvious. No significant differences were observed in obesity and relative height among mussels living in three different microhabitats (i.e. solid mud and plant litter, soft silt, soft silt and sand). The shells from Mt. Margaret Dam (a temporary dam) were thinner and their growth lines were easier to discriminate than those from the Ross River. Comparing with those living in temperate regions of Australia, the obesity and the relative height of mussels from the Ross River were smaller. Only few abnormal shells were found which usually appeared only as external deformations, such as: a light deflection on ventral margin and scars on the surface of shells.

However, the cultivation of this crop in Indonesia is hampered by Fusarium wilt (Panama disease) as a result of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense (Foc) infection. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate inhibitory effects of culture filtrates (CF) of three Foc isolates (Banyuwangi, Malang, and Bojonegoro isolates) on shoot growth of abaca cv. Tangongon and Sangihe-1, (ii) determine sublethal concentration of Foc CF, (iii) isolate variant cells/tissues which are insensitive against Foc CF and regenerate plantlets from the variants, and (iv) evaluate responses of the plantlets against Foc infection. The results of the experiment showed that even though CF of all Foc isolates inhibited abaca's shoot growth, CF of Foc Banyuwangi isolate showed the most inhibitory effect. Sublethal concentration of CF of Foc Banyuwangi isolate was 40%. From abaca cv. Tangongon, 326 shoots were regenerated from CF insensitive embryogenic calli while from Sangihe-1 – 176 shoots were regenerated. Following acclimatization and Foc inoculation using detached-leaf dual culture test, a total of four immune, two resistant, and two moderately resistant plantlets were identified out of 45 tested variants of Tangongon.

In their role of cellulose digestion, the worker termites use two sources of cellulolytic enzyme that include cellulases produced by the termite and the gut symbions. Macrotermes gilvus classified in mound builder termite, mostly depend on cellulolytic bacteria for cellulose digestion. This study aims to characterize cellulolytic bacteria of termite gut symbionts of worker M. gilvus and to identify the cellulolytic bacteria based on sequences of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Cellulolytic bacteria of termite gut were isolated and cultured in CMC (Carboxymethyl cellulose) media. The biochemical characters of bacterial isolates were assayed using Microbact 12A and 12B. Cellulolytic activity was determined based on formation of clear zone and cellulolytic index on CMC plate media. The bacterial isolate that has the highest cellulolytic index was analyzed for its 16S rRNA gene sequences. Four isolates of cellulolytic bacteria were successfully isolated from gut of M. gilvus with aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The highest formation of cellulolytic index (2.5) was revealed by RA2. BLAST-N (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for Nucleotides) result of 16S rRNA gene sequences of RU4 and RA2 isolates showed that the isolate has similarity with Bacillus megaterium and Paracoccus yeei, respectively.

Sexual monomorphism, in which males and females are not easily distinguishable, is one such factor and is a common problem in captive breeding of many avian and reptile species. Species-specific nuclear DNA markers, recently developed to identify portions of sex chromosomes, were employed in this study for sex determination of Komodo dragons (Varanus Komodoensis). Each animal was uniquely tagged using a passive integrated micro-transponder (TROVAN 100A type transponders of 13 mm in length and 2 mm in diameter). The sex of a total of 81 individual Komodo dragons (44 samples from Ragunan zoo, 26 samples from Surabaya zoo, and 11 samples from Gembira Loka zoo) were determined using primers Ksex 1for and Ksex 3rev. A series of preliminary PCR amplifications were conducted using DNA from individuals of known sex. During these preliminary tests, researchers varied the annealing temperatures, number of cycles, and concentrations of reagents, in order to identify the best protocol for sex determination using our sample set. We thus developed our own PCR protocol for this study, which resulted in the amplification of band A in females and band C in males. Results from band B, however, turned out to be non-determinative in our study because, for females, band B was not always visible, and for males sometimes a similar, but lighter band was also amplified, making interpretation difficult. In this study, sex determination was based mainly on the difference in size between the female-specific 812 bp fragment and the homologous, longer fragment amplified for males. © 2014 Institut Pertanian Bogor","captive breeding; komodo dragon; molecular sexing; PCR; zoo",,"SULANDARI, S.R.I.; Research Center for Biology, The Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI), Cibinong Science Center, Jalan Raya Jakarta Bogor, Km. 46, Indonesia; email: ssulanda@yahoo.co.id",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

To date, little information exists on the use of molecular markers to predict physicochemical properties of the “indica” rice varieties found in Indonesia. The objective of this study was to investigate physicochemical properties and genetic variation of Indonesian rice varieties, and to formulate regression equations to analyze sets of DNA markers which could predict amylose content (AC), protein content (PC) and pasting properties of the varieties. A total of 24 Indonesian indica rice varieties were chosen based on their genetic background and agricultural characteristics. We then measured selected physicochemical properties, and genotyped the varieties using 30 DNA markers. The chosen varieties showed favorable values for PC, AC, and six rapid viscosity analyzer (RVA) pasting properties, which was supported by molecular data. As demonstrated by principal component analysis (PCA), markers could provide a complementary method for differentiating rice varieties, as an alternative to measuring physicochemical properties. PCA analysis also allowed us to establish marker sets using multiple regression analysis. We formulated eight model regression equations comprising data regarding 15 to 19 markers with high coefficients (R2=0.98-0.99). The formulas provided results that consistently correlated and therefore predicted the physicochemical properties of indica rice. Further validation of these marker sets may provide rapid and efficient means for predicting the physicochemical properties of Indonesian-bred indica rice in the future. © 2014 Institut Pertanian Bogor","indica rice; molecular marker; multiple regression; physicochemical properties",,"KOH, H.E.E.-J.O.N.G.; Indonesian Center for Agricultural Biotechnology and Genetic Resources Research and Development, IAARD Jalan Tentara Pelajar No. 3A, Indonesia; email: heejkoh@snu.ac.kr",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

The results showed that the truss morphological characters could highlight the high differentiation between Relo and the other two groups, and the closeness of Eas and Depik. The morphometric data strongly indicated that Eas and Depik should be regarded as a same species, Rasbora tawarensis, and Relo may be considered as a cryptic species. This finding is in agreement to the genetic data which was published previously. © 2013 Institut Pertanian Bogor","Depik; Eas; Relo; Truss network and Discriminant Function Analysis",,"MUCHLISIN, Z.A.; Department of Aquaculture, Faculty of Marine and Fisheries, Syiah Kuala UniversityIndonesia; email: muchlisinza@yahoo.com",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

Like of most other genera of moths, the systematic of this genus is still in dispute, especially on the taxonomy and classification within this genus due to their morphological characters that are very difficult to distinguish from one to others. Molecular approaches such as using CO I gene sequence to differentiate among species has been recommended since this gene has ability to reveal the character identity at the specific level. In order to populate the genetic characters of Indonesian Mythimna, to clarify the clasification within the genus Mythimna and to reveal the phylogenetic relationship among them, we analyzed 14 species of Mythimna and two species outgroups (Spodoptera litura dan S. exigua) based on nucleotide sequence variation across a 649 bp region in the CO I gene. Over entire 649 bp region 72% of the nucleotide positions were constant, 10.6% were uninformtive (i.e. any variants were found in a single sequence) and 16.9% were parsimony informative. The informative site constituted in the 3rd codon position was the highest, whereas in 2nd codon position was the lowest. The results also showed that the base composition of this region was low A + T biased. The results showed that the monophyly of Mytimna was supported by 95% bootstrap test at any tree building methods. The three subgenera based on morphology were recovered but M. (Mythimna) shown to be a paraphyletic group in term of M. (Hyphilare), and M. (Pseudalteia); M. (Mythimna) was branched off first then followed by M. (Pseudaletia) and M. (Hyphilare). However, all internal nodes were least support except for the monophyly of subgenus M. (Hyphilare). It indicates that the relationships among internal nodes proposed here were least valid due to the number of species included in the analysis which may not be enough to represent the real number of species in the nature. More investigation was needed by including more species and other genes. © 2012 Institut Pertanian Bogor","CO I gene; Mythimna; phylogenetic relationships",,,,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

The genetic relationship between these populations is important to choose parents to avoid closely related genotypes in hand pollination. Therefore RAPD analysis was carried out using four selected primers i.e. OPH-03, OPH-05, OPH-18 and OPN-06. The result showed that Wickham and IRRDB 1981 population were separated into two different big groups with genetic similarity value of 0.64, and those big groups were separated further into many small sub groups with some genetic similarity level. The genetic similarity matrix showed that Wickham and IRRDB 1981 population has a range of genetic similarity 0.37– 0.98. The highest genetic similarity was found between RRIM 600 and PN 621, while the lowest was between BPM 1 and RRIC 100. Value in this matrix showed the genetic diversity between each clone.

The regressions among observed peroxidase activity, lignin content and disease severity were used to determine the possible mechanisms of S. rolfsii resistance in peanut. Peanut seeds were grown in polybag and the growing plants were inoculated at the crown, stem, and leaf tissues. Results of the experiment indicated that infection of S. rolfsii in peanut did not induce oxidative burst. However, infection of the pathogen resulted in increased peroxidase activity and lignin content in the infected tissues.

It is an emerging technology for environmental remediation that offers a low-cost technique suitable for use against different types of contaminants in a variety of media. Phytoremediation is potentially applicable to a diversity of substances, involving hyperaccumulators heavy metals and radionuclides. It is also applicable to other inorganic contaminants such as arsenic, various salts and nutrients, and a variety of organic contaminants, including explosives, petroleum hydrocarbons and pesticides. At least there are one taxon of plant as hyperaccumulator for Cd, 28 taxa for Co, 37 taxa for Cu, 9 taxa for Mg, 317 taxa for Ni, and 11 taxa for Zn. Extensive progress were done in characterizing physiology of plants which hyperaccumulate or hypertolerate metals. Hypertolerance is fundamental to hyperaccumulator, and high rates of uptake and translocation are observed in hyperaccumulator plants. Hyperaccumulator plants and agronomic technology were undertaken to improve the annual rate of phytoextraction and to allow recycling of soil toxic metals accumulated in plant biomass. These techniques are very likely to support commercial environmental remediation. Most phytoremediation systems are still in development, or in the stage of plant breeding to improve the cultivars for field use. However, application for commercial purposes has already been initiated.

Morphological and molecular identifications were applied to identify Aspergillus isolated from corn grains used as livestock feed. Morphologically, six species were tentatively identified, namely Aspergillus niger (Groups I and II), Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus clavatus and Aspergillus terreus. Isolates of A. niger was divided into two groups based on slight differences of their colony appearances. Molecular identification using internal transcribed spacer and β-tubulin sequences supported morphological identification except isolates for A. niger Group II isolates, which were molecularly identified as Aspergillus tubingensis. Neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree showed that isolates from the same species were grouped in the same clade. The present study showed that diverse species of Aspergillus are prevalent in corn grain used as livestock feed. It is also necessary to correctly identify the Aspergillus species to employ correct treatment of contaminated corn grains. The occurrence of well-known toxigenic species such as A. niger, A. flavus and A. fumigatus suggested the possible risk of mycotoxin contamination of the corn grain. © 2017 Institut Pertanian Bogor","Aspergillus; corn grains; ITS; morphology; phylogenetic analysis; β-tubulin",,"Zakaria, L.; School of Biological Sciences, Universiti Sains MalaysiaMalaysia; email: Lfah@usm.my",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

The purpose of this study was to screen the Indonesian plant which has strong phylogenetic relationship with Ashwaganda. Thus, phylogenetic analysis using DNA sequences of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was conducted. Thus, 19 species of Solanaceae and two species of Convolvulaceae as outgroup were examined. Five ITS regions of Ashwaganda retrieved from GenBank were included in the phylogenetic analysis. Parsimony analysis showed that Indonesia Solanaceae comprises seven groups which is consistent with the global Solanaceae relationship as previously reported.

Their roles especially as generalist predators are important in forest ecosystem. No studies reported their diversity and abundance in forest ecosystem on Mt. Bawakaraeng, specifically in montane habitat yet. This study was aimed to analyze diversity and abundance of Carabidae and Staphylinidae in four montane habitat types, i.e. agricultural area, pine forest, eucalypts and natural forest (1,835 m asl), and natural forest (2,165 m asl). They were collected using pitfall traps. A total of 42 carabid beetles belonging to nine species and 260 staphylinid beetles belonging to 37 species were collected. Diversity and abundance of Staphylinidae were higher than Carabidae, this is predicted because of higher mobility in Staphylinidae compared to Carabidae. In Carabidae, the highest species richness was recorded in agricultural area, whereas the highest species richness of Staphylinidae occurred in natural forest (2165 m asl). In Staphylinidae, the two largest subfamilies are Aleocharinae and Staphylininae. Aephinidius adelioides occupied the highest abundance of Carabidae and found in agricultural area. The differences in each montane habitat type are presumed to cause variation in species richness of soil beetles, especially for Carabidae. © 2016 Institut Pertanian Bogor","Carabidae; diversity; montane habitat; Mt.

Up to 40% of lignocellulose biomass are consisted of xylan. Xylan complete breakdown requires the action of xylanase. Xylanase has been used to breakdown xylan into commercial product such as low calories sugar, prebiotic, and biofuel. Due to its wide application, several variation of xylanase characterization are needed. Our previous studies have collected Paenibacillus sp. XJ18 from TNBD forest, Jambi, Indonesia, to gain a unique enzyme characteristic. In this study the characteristic of crude xylanase from Paenibacillus sp. XJ18 was investigated. The highest activity of xylanase production was at 36 h. The xylanase showed activity in a broad range of pH (4.5-9.0). The highest activity showed at pH 5.0, 90 °C. Crude enzyme extract was unstable and had halftime at its pH and optimum temperature about 67 min. The xylanase activity was increased about 4.59 times after being concentrated by 70% acetone (2.4578 U/mL). Based on TLC result, xylanase from Paenibacillus sp.

The rGH was mixed with chicken egg yolk and sprayed on to artificial feed with different protein levels (34, 28, and 21%; isoenergy). Each treatment group of gourami was paired with a control group that received feed of the same protein level, but without rGH supplementation. Juvenile of giant gourami (weight 15.83 ± 0.13 g) were fed diets containing rGH, to apparent satiation, 2 times a week. Fish were reared from less than 2 months old for 42 days in 100 L glass aquaria at an initial density of 10 fish per aquarium. At the end of this period, the biomass and daily growth rate (SGR) of the fish were measured and the feed conversion ratio calculated and compared. Our data showed that fish fed rGH-supplemented diets experienced higher growth than fish in the control groups and showed that fish with higher protein diets experienced higher growth than the groups with less protein diets. The group with the highest biomass gain, SGR, and lowest feed conversion ratio (FCR) was the group fed a 34% protein diet supplemented with rGH. Furthermore, biomass gain, SGR, and FCR in the rGH treatment group with a 28% protein diet matched the measurements of the non-rGH control group receiving a 34% protein diet (P > 0.05). We conclude that giant juvenile gourami given feed supplemented with recombinant growth hormone will experience increased growth and dietary utility compared with gourami given the same feed without supplementation. © 2015 Institut Pertanian Bogor","feed protein levels; giant gourami; growth; rGH",,"BUDI, D.S.; Study Program of Aquaculture Science, Department of Aquaculture, Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Science, Bogor Agricultural University, Dramaga Campus, Indonesia; email: darma.jhders@gmail.com",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

Production of biodiesel requires plant seed as raw material, so the viability of JC for use in biodiesel will dependent greatly on the plant's production of flowers. Generally, this plant is monoecious, meaning it has both male and female flowers. However, very rarely JC plants may be andromonoecious. Andromonoecious specimens of JC produce hermaphrodite and male flowers in the same plant. The number of hermaphrodite flowers per inflorescence is generally low compared to the number of male flowers. The aim of this study was to increase the proportion of hermaphrodite flowers by using plant growth regulators (PGRs) in andromonoecious JC. Our experiment was conducted in Randomized Block Design (RBD) with 9 treatments, namely kinetin, GA3, and IAA with concentrations of 0 ppm as a control, 50 and 100 ppm of each PGRs. The treatments were applied to stem cuttings from each plant and repeated 4 times. PGRs were applied by spraying the leaves within the buds of each plant. Applications took place weekly beginning when the plants entered flower initiating phase, until inflorescence produced. Observations were conducted during the treatment period (10 weeks). Results showed that plants treated with IAA, GA3, and kinetin at 50 and 100 ppm produced increased inflorescence per plant. The increases measured were 155.4 and 92.9% of (IAA), 120.4 and 151% (GA3), 96.6 and 51.7% (kinetin) respectively. In addition, we found that application and GA3 at concentrations of 50 and 100 ppm, and kinetin at 50 ppm, increased the number of hermaphrodite flowers per inflorescence by 50%, and increased the number of hermaphrodite flowers per plant by 275.6 and 183.1% (IAA), 219.5 and 254.1% (GA3), 162.9 and 103.1% (kinetin) respectively. As would be expected, the number of fruit per plant increased in those specimens treated with IAA, GA3, and kinetin at 50 and 100 ppm.

The objective of this study was to investigate the adaptability of introduced wheat genotypes in tropical agro-ecosystems. Sixteen spring wheat genotypes were grown at two different altitudes i.e. low altitude (176 m asl) with an average temperature of 29.8 °C located at Leuwikopo Field Experimental Station, Bogor Agricultural University, Darmaga Bogor and high altitude (1100 m asl) with an average temperature of 20.6 °C at Cipanas Field Experimental Station (Ornamental Crop Research Station), Cianjur, West Java, Indonesia from July to November 2012. Plant height, number of tillers, flag leaf area, leaf angle, days to flowering, spike number per plant, empty spikelet number, grain weight per plant and 100 grain weight were observed following the standard methods. Heat susceptibility index was calculated based on grain weight per plant. The results showed that cultivation at a low altitude, hotter environment remarkably affected wheat growth and yield, as reflected in overall reduction of plant height, reduced number of tillers and leaf area, and ultimately reduced yield and yield components for most genotypes compared to the same measures taken at high altitude in lower temperatures. Plant growth before heading was similar in both locations, but the days to flowering was longer in high altitude than that in low altitude. High temperature stress in low altitude reduced the spike number/plant, grain weight/plant, 100 grain weight and increase number of empty spikelet/spike. Based on our results for heat susceptibility index, six genotypes, namely Sbr, Ymh, Astreb/Cbrd, Astreb/Ningma, H-20 and Nias, were characterized as heat tolerant genotypes. © 2014 Institut Pertanian Bogor","agro-ecosystem; heat stress; heat susceptibility index; high altitude; low altitude; wheat",,"MIFTAHUDIN; Plant Biology Graduate Program, Graduate School, Bogor Agricultural University, Darmaga Campus, Indonesia; email: miftahudin@ipb.ac.id",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

The aim of this study was to evaluate contribution of alpha (α) and beta (β) diversity across land-use type to gamma (γ) diversity at the margins of tropical forest in Central Sulawesi using dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) as a focal group. Baited pitfall traps set in four land-use types ranging from natural forest through cacao agroforestry systems to open areas during two years of sampling (2009 and 2012). A total of 28 dung beetle species belonging to four genera were captured during the study period. The results showed that contribution of β diversity was higher than that of α diversity of dung beetles. Each land-use type contributed about 56.5 to 62.5% of the total species richness (γ diversity). The similar pattern of biodiversity between each spatial scale and during the two sampling years emphasized the large contribution of each land-use type to maintaining a high portion of the regional species richness.

Survival rate, intermolt period, carapace width, and molting synchronicity were evaluated. Additionally, lipid classes and fatty acid composition of enriched Artemia were analyzed. Survival rate, intermolt period, and carapace width at the first crab (FC) stage of mud crab larvae fed DHA-SL0 to 40 were similar to that of WDHA-CPL but higher than that of WDHA-SL (P < 0.05). Moreover, mud crab larvae fed DHA-SL20, DHA-SL40, and WDHA-CPL had a significantly higher molting synchronicity index compared to that of larvae fed WDHA-SL and DHA-SL0.

Bioremediation strategies using bacteria have been proposed as an attractive alternative because this is effective, less expensive and more efficient to remove mercury. Brevundimonas sp. HgP1 and Brevundimonas sp. HgP2 were two highly mercury resistant bacteria isolated from a gold mine in Pongkor village with MIC of 575 ppm. The purposes of the research were to study the effect of mercury on bacterial growth and morphological changes of bacterial colony and to measure the ability of bacterial isolates to accumulate Hg2+. The growth was monitored by measuring optical density at 600 nm, whereas accumulation of Hg2+ was measured by mercury vaporation unit. This present studies revealed that the addition of 50 and 100 ppm HgCl2 in Brevundimonas sp. HgP1 resulted in the decreasing of growth rate and the elongation of lag phase in 8 and 16 hours, respectively. The addition of HgCl2 also affected morphological appearance of the bacterial colony to black. Brevundimonas sp.

This study investigated the EcM fungi associated with Merbau by using both sporocarp morphology and EcM morphotypes. Morphological characters of sporocarps and basidiocarps of the fungi and EcM morphotypes obtained from seedlings and trees from natural and plantation stands of merbau, as well as from nurseries were compared to the description of those resulted from baiting method. Only one species of ectomycorrhizal fungus was found associated with merbau [Intsia bijuga (Colebr.) Kuntze] which has not been described yet. The fungus formed mycorrhizae with monopodial pinnate branching. The fungus was identified belonging to the genus of Scleroderma. The fungus was more common to occur beneath merbau seedlings than trees.

Epididymis sperms may be the last chance to ensure preservation of genetic materials after injury or death of a valuable animal. Studies have been conducted to determine wether both epididymis sperms and oocytes can be used to produce viable embryos and offspring. The purpose of this study was to determine how long cats sperms contained in epididymis were remain motile and had intact membranes when preserved at 4 ° C, and to determine whether such those preserved sperms are able to fertilize oocytes. Epididymis was preserved immediately in phosphate buffer saline at 4 ° C for 1, 3, and 6 days. The observation of sperm quality and viability after preservation was performed by vital staining acrosom and Hoechst-Propidium Iodine. Biological functions of sperms were evaluated by in vitro culture technique for fertilization, micro fertilization and embryonic development rate in CR1aa medium. The results showed that average motility of sperms collected from ductus deferens, cauda and corpus epididymis decreased not significantly (P > 0.05) from 0, 1, 3, and 6 days of preservation times (from 83.0%, 80.2%, 79.0%; 80.9%, 75.0%, 75.5%; 52.0%, 63.2%, 55.0% to 34.6%, 34.6%, 33.3%, respectively). The general results showed that sperms from epididymis preserved for 1, 3, and 6 days can be used for IVF. The rate of embryonal cleavage produced by IVF technique using sperms collected from epididymis preserved for 1-, 3- and 6-days were 33.3, 26.7, and 20.0%, respectively and significantly different (p < 0.05) from that of controll (50.0%).

Its population is estimated less than 300 individuals remaining in the wild with highly declining rate to 50% in the last 15 years. The number of male rhinoceroses in the captivity are very few, therefore the assessment of its fertility is very important in order to support the breeding success since the captive breeding success is very poor. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine the male reproductive status, (ii) to establish a reliable semen collection method, and (iii) to assess semen parameters of the fresh collected sample. Three methods of semen collection were examined to determine its fertilizing potential, i.e. (i) stimulated combination of artificial vagina (AV), penile massage (PM) and accessory gland massage (AGM); (ii) AV and PM; and (iii) only with PM. The first method gave the best result with an ejaculation success of 85.71% (6/7, n = 7). The second and third methods obtained an ejaculation success rate of 50% (2/4, n = 4)) and 25% (1/4, n = 4), respectively. The collected ejaculates had a volume of 1.2-12.4 ml with whitish to cream turbid colour and pH 6.90-6.99. Sperm concentration was (143-333) × 103 sperm/ml. The quality of the sperm was low with only approximately 1% of them moved forward slowly. Approximately 80% of the spermatozoa were immature (prox. cytoplasmic droplet) with head (macro-, microcephalic) and tail abnormalities (broken tail). Semen quality increased after several collections and the amount of immature sperm decreased up to 5%. Electroejaculation procedure could produce 34 ml semen, but no sperm was found in the ejaculate. Hence, the combination of AV, PM, and AGM could get higher volume of ejaculate compared to other methods, but sperm concentration was better obtained using AV and PM only. Repeated semen collection increased semen quality, although the male has low fertilizing capacity due to low sperm concentration (oligozoospermia) and small volume of the ejaculate (oligospermia). © 2008 Institut Pertanian Bogor","collection; semen; sperms; Sumatran rhino",,"AGIL, M.; Department of Clinics, Reproduction and Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Bogor Agricultural University, Darmaga CampusIndonesia; email: rhinogil@indo.net.id",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

In the previous experiment, four abaca variant lines were regenerated from (i) embryogenic calli (TC line), (ii) ethyl methyl sulphonate (EMS) treated embryogenic calli (EMS line), (iii) EMS treated embryogenic calli, followed by in vitro selection on Foc culture filtrate (EMS+CF line), and (iv) EMS treated embryogenic calli, followed by in vitro selection on fusaric acid (EMS+FA line). All abaca variants were grown in a glasshouse and inoculated with Banyuwangi isolate of Foc (Foc Bw). Initial root length (RL) and plant height (PH) of the abaca variants were recorded before inoculation, while scores of plant damage (SPD), and their survival were recorded at 60 days after inoculation (DAI). The results showed that the initial RL and PH did not affect survival of the tested abaca variants. Regardless of their initial RL and PH, susceptible abaca variants died before 60 DAI while resistance ones still survived. Abaca variants regenerated from single clump of embryogenic callus showed an array of responses against Foc Bw infection, indicating the existence of a mix cells population. The Foc Bw resistance abaca variants were successfully identified from four tested abaca variant lines, although with different frequencies. However, more Foc Bw resistance abaca plants were identified from EMS+CF line than the others. Using the developed procedures, 8 resistance abaca plants were identified from abaca cv.

Seven isolates of PGPR, i.e. BC1, BTP2H, BTP3G, BTP3O BTP1, BTP2D, and T1F were applied as seed treatment and soil drench. Plants height, number of branch, and fruits weight were measured every one and ten weeks after virus inoculation. Virus concentration in plants and disease incidence were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). Results showed that inoculation with PGPR improved the seed germination. Eight days after sowing, the percentage of PGPR treated seed germination reached 50-84%; whereas those of untreated seed reached only 18%. In general, PGPR treatment significantly reduced (p ≤ 0.05) the effect of virus infection on plant growth. Two PGPR isolates, i.e. BTP1 and BTP2H, maintained fruit weight of infected plants as good as those of healthy plants. Based on ELISA, PGPR was able to inhibit the disease incidence. The BTP3O and BTP2D isolates even protected the plant from ChiVMV infection. Concentration of salicylic acid and peroxidase were relatively higher on plants treated with PGPR than those without PGPR treatment. This gave an indication that PGPR may act as induction agents for systemic acquired resistance. Therefore, PGPR treatment is a promising strategy to control viral diseases on chillipepper. © 2005 Institut Pertanian Bogor",,,"HIDAYAT, S.H.; Departemen Proteksi Tanaman, Institut Pertanian Bogor, Kampus Darmaga, Indonesia; email: shidayat@ipb.ac.id",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English; Indonesian","Hayati J.

The occurrence, content, and distribution of four mangrove seedlings were analyzed by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography. The structural groups of the polyprenols and dolichols in the leaves and roots were classified into two types (I and II).

The lack of data and information of shorebirds habitats in this area limits conservation efforts and further threatens the survival of these species. The objective of this study is to investigate trends in habitat use by migratory shorebirds. Field work was conducted during migration season starting from October 2014 until April 2015. The presence of migratory shorebirds was assessed using binoculars and a monocular. Scan sampling was used to describe habitat use by shorebirds. The difference in behaviour among habitat was analyzed using analysis of variance. There were 30 species of shorebirds distributed across seven different habitat types in our study area. The most widely used habitat by shorebirds was mudflats, followed by marshes and plantations. This study revealed that mudflat habitat has high potential in supporting the existence of migratory shorebirds in this area. © 2017 Institut Pertanian Bogor","behaviour; Deli Serdang; habitat use; migratory shorebirds",,"Perwitasari-Farajallah, D.; Department of Biology, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Bogor Agricultural UniversityIndonesia; email: witafar@yahoo.com",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

Nowadays, Indonesia still relies on import for its supply. Hence, the utilization of local Artemia sp. as an alternative to the imported product is recommended as it contains more protein and less expensive. The advantages of local Artemia sp. is its better crystal quality as it is still fresh. It also provides better income for salt farmers because waste water from salt farm can be used to culture Artemia sp. This research is aimed at determining the quality of locally-produced Artemia sp., by evaluation of its essential amino acid and fatty acid profiles after treatments. Our results indicated that Artemia sp. cysts with good quality were produced after 8 hours and Artemia sp. reaches a hatching rate of 1,320,000 cysts (95%) after 27 hours. We also found an indication that the best feed concentration was a mix of 60% Chaetoceros calcitrans with 40% Skeletonema costatum. Fatty acid profile analyses showed that the highest SAFA (12.86%) and PUFA (29.91%) were gained after feeding with Chaetoceros calcitrans, whereas the highest HUFA (4.93%) was gained after feeding with Skeletonemacostatum. Essential amino acid profile analyses revealed the highest content of amino acid (18912.62 ppm) was after feeding with a combination of Chaetoceros calcitrans and Skeletonema costatum.

This study was aimed to determine the diversity, nest sizes, and fluctuations in the use of sites for nesting by Apis cerana Fabr. in polyculture plantations in two altitudes in West Sumatra. A census method was used to obtain the data variables in 10 plantations (five locations for each altitute). Polyculture plantations used as the study sites were dominated by coconut in lowland areas and coffee in highland areas. The results showed that nesting sites of Apis cerana were found amongst 18 species of plants belonging to 15 families (12 species in lowlands and seven species in highlands). Most of the nests were placed on Cocos nucifera (coconut) trees in lowland sites, and on Erythria variegata (dadap) in highland sites. Nests were also found to be located mostly in the cavities of trees with diameter 21-60 cm. Nest entrances were located at 228.31 cm above ground surface (ags) in highland and at 116.04 cm ags in lowlands. The nest entrances in highlands measured 12.21 by 3.73 cm (height and width), and in the lowlands 14.93 by 7.36 cm. The percentage of tree cavities used for nesting was statically higher in lowland (40.73%) compared to high land (17.86%), but it fluctuated very slightly in both high or lowland areas during observation. The percentage of trees with nests decreased in December and January but increased in February, with the same patterns found in both high and lowlands. Our research suggests that higher tree diversity in polyculture plantations promotes increased use by honeybees for nesting. Thus, the more tree diversity in polyculture plantations the better it could conserve natural honey bees populations. © 2014 Institut Pertanian Bogor","altitude; colony fluctuation; honeybee; nesting diversity",,"JASMI; Department of Biology Education, STKIP PGRI West Sumatra, Gunung Pangilun Street, Indonesia; email: jasmi.ahmadsudin@gmail.com",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

All images were analyzed using ImageJ 1.47 software to measure the haemozoin areas. Our results showed that non birefringent haemozoin and birefringent haemozoin area was significantly different. This was because when using conventional light microscope the brown area that contained images of non birefringent haemozoin images also contained Kupffer cells which appeared as the same brown color as haemozoin.

About 1.2% mango trees from nine sub-districts have been defoliated by the larvae of this species. The larvae of this genus have been reported to forage at Anacardiacea as well; however, they have never been reported to forage at cultivated mango trees in Indonesia. Since there is no biological information of this species, thus, a study on some biological aspects of this species is needed. This study was conducted in the field as well as in the laboratory during 4 months (March-July 2011). The diagnostic characters of this species are black scale at dorsal antenna on both male and female and slightly setae particularly at the costal angle of valve on the male genitalia. Life span of this species is in the range of 30-37 days. This study also found four natural enemies of A. riguata i.e.: Bleparipa sp. (Diptera: Tachinidae), Euagathis sp. (Hymenoptera: Brachonidae), Theronia sp. (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), and Brachymeria lasus (Hymenoptera: Chalcididae). Moreover, a single fungal pathogen of this species also was identified, i.e. Isaria fumosorosea Wize. Having these results, we considered that to control A. riguata, one need to conserve the native natural enemies by manipulating their environment. © 2013 Institut Pertanian Bogor","Arctornis riguata; biological aspects; mango; pathogen; Probolinggo",,"SUTRISNO, H.A.R.I.; Research Center for Biology, the Indonesian Institute of Sciences, Jalan Raya Bogor Km. 46, Indonesia; email: sutrisnohari@yahoo.com",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

The organs mostly sensitive to the lack of thiamine levels in the body are the nervous system and the heart. Thiamine deficiency causes symptoms of polyneuritis and cardiovascular diseases. Because of its importance in the metabolism of carbohydrates, we need to measure the levels of thiamine in the body fluids by using an easy and inexpensive way without compromising the sensitivity and selectivity. An option to it is thiamine measurement based on the principle of which is analogous to ELISA, in which a thiamine binding protein (TBP) act by replacing antibodies. The presence of TBP in several seeds have been reported by previous researchers, but the presence of TBP in mung beans has not been studied. This study was aimed to isolate and purify TBP from mung bean. The protein was isolated from mung bean through salting out by ammonium sulphate of 40, 70, and 90% (w/v). TBP has a negative charge as shown by cellulose acetate electrophoresis. The result obtained after salting out by ammonium sulphate was further purified bymeans of DEAE-cellulose chromatography and affinity chromatography. In precipitation of 90% of salting out method, one peak protein was obtained by using affinity chromatography. The protein was analyzed by SDS PAGE electrophoresis.

It cannot be done in half the world's species when they are adults, and virtually none can be sexed as chicks. Despite this, the sex of a bird is vital for captive breeding. An increased number of birds are being sexed using DNA amplification techniques. In this approach, the CHD-W and CHD-Z are distinguished by the amplification of an intron present in both genes. PCR products on the gel electrophoresis vary in size revealing one band in males at the CHD-Z, and two bands in females corresponding to both the CHD-W and CHD-Z. Two independent sets of primer (P8/P2 and 2550F/2718R) were used to amplify the CHD gene region from both the Z and W chromosome. One hundred and ten (110) birds were sexed using first pair of primers: (P8/P2). Sexing results indicated that 81.8% were successfully determined, 12.7% failed to be amplified and 5.5% were not perfectly determined because the PCR products showed thick band. The thick band caused misidentified female to male birds. An alternative primer (2550F/2718R) was applied to solve the problem. Two hundreds and twenty-nine birds were sexed and the results showed 100% successfully determined.

N. x hookeriana was hypothesised to be a natural hybrid between N. ampullaria and N. rafflesiana on the basis of morphological characters. Several variants of each species were also known. This present study aimed to detect the occurrence of hybrid within N. x hookeriana ‘spotted’ and ‘green’ variant using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR). Five RAPD primers and three ISSR primers were used to amplify total DNA genome and produced 83 polymorphic bands ranging in size from 300-1700 bp. Clustering analysis was performed based on RAPD and ISSR profiles using the UPGMA method. The genetic similarity of the combined markers range between 0.30-0.75 indicating a narrow range of genetic similarity among the accessions. Results from cluster analyses suggested that N. x hookeriana was indeed a hybrid between N. ampullaria and N.

Rubisco is the world's most abundant protein in plants and has the job of uniquely preparing CO2 for chemical reduction. Rubisco activity in the leaf, described by Vcmax, can be estimated from gas exchange measurements of the initial slope of the response of CO2 assimilation rate, A, to intercellular [CO2]. This technique of estimation is favourable because it can avoid the uncertainties and difficulties when Vcmax is obtained directly by extraction and biochemical assay in artificial media. Rate of assimilation of soybean plants grown at different temperature (20/15, 25/20, and 32/27 °C day/night temperature) and [CO2] (350 and 700 μmol mol−1), were measured using gas exchange. The effect of wall conductance (gw) on the parameterization of assimilations rate was observed. The temperature dependence of Vcmax depends strongly on wall conductance, where the shape of the curve would change significantly if finite wall conductance were included in the analysis. The implication is that it changes the values and interpretation of the temperature response of assimilation rate. © 2011 Institut Pertanian Bogor","assimilation rate; gas exchange; temperature response; Vcmax; wall conductance",,,,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

They are harvested from the bark of trees Cinchona spp. after certain ages and therefore are available over a limited time. Cell culture is an alternative way to continuously produce such secondary metabolites in a much shorter time. Various substances were added in the normal growth media to promote quinoline alkaloids production by cell cultures of Cinchona ledgeriana. At the sixth week of culture, quinine and cinchonine contents were suppressed by paclobutrazol (PBZ), abscisic acid (ABA), or even by precursor tryptophan, while cinchonidine content was enhanced by 0.2 mg/l tryptophan to 43 fold of that produced by untreated cells (2.8% dry weight). At the seventh week of culture, the production of quinine and quinidine started to grow whereas the production of cinchonine and cinchonidine tended to decrease. An addition of 5 mg/l PBZ to culture media yielded the highest level of total quinine/quinidine after seven weeks, e.g. quinine 11 times more abundant and quinidine 23 fold higher compared to the untreated cells.

Previous studies proved that parasitoid encapsulation was found to be an important factor limiting the effectiveness of the parasitoid in controlling pest population in the field. Since 1998, we have conducted series studies to investigate encapsulation mechanism developed by hosts against parasitoid, responses of parasitoid toward encapsulation ability and to determine factors that may help parasitoid avoid encapsulation. Parasitoid responses were examined on two different hosts C. pavonana and Spodoptera litura. Our findings showed that parasitization level was found to be high both on C. pavonana and S. litura. Encapsulation occurred to be high in all larva stages of C. pavonana, in contrast encapsulation was recorded very low in all larvae stages of S. litura. We recorded that encapsulation in the larval body of C. pavonana was completed in 72 hours and mostly occurred in higher larval stage. Melanization was only recorded in encapsulated parasitoid inside larva body of C. pavonana, not in S. litura. We recorded that encapsulation increased blood cell number of both larvae C. pavonana and S. litura. Encapsulation may affect development of immature parasitoid. Weight of S. litura's pupae containing encapsulated parasitoid was found to be lower in S. litura, but not in C. pavonana.

Both species have similarities, i.e. they occur on the same host plant and prefer mature leaves of E. camaldulensis for oviposition and feeding sites. They might thus be more likely to show competition than the less closely related taxa. The purpose of the study was to examine degree of the resource use by measuring the area of leaves damaged by the nymphs of C. albitextura and C. retator. The results indicated that the nymph of C. retator caused damage twice more damages than that of C. albitextura.

The improvement of durable Blast resistance is difficult due to the complexity of the inheritance of this trait. This study was conducted to evaluate the genetic control and inheritance of Blast resistance trait in interspesific population between IR 64 (accepted Indonesian rice type, medium resistant to Indonesian Blast pathogen) and Oryza rufipogon (AA genome; acc. No.IRGC#105491; donor for Blast resistance). Six populations, i.e. P1, P2, F1, F2, BCP1, and BCP2, were inoculated with three Indonesian races of Blast pathogen. The disease intensity was determined on the basis of disease leaf area (DLA). The three types of gene interactions (additive, dominance, and epistatis) were significantly involved in this trait. Among the digenic epistasis interactions, all of the additive x additive [i], additive x dominance (j) and dominance x dominance (l) contributed to the trait. Broad-sense heritability ranged from 50.30 up to 91.20%, while the narrow heritability ranged from 16.98 up to 73.20%.

One group of peanut plants were grown in plastic pots and subjected to stress condition during the period of 15-45 days (Experiment I) or 15-80 days (Experiment II) by watering them only in every 4-7 days and were harvested at days 75 (Experiment I) or at maturity (Experiment II). The other group was grown optimally in plastic pot up to harvest period. Leaf prolin content was determined at 12 (before stress), 30 (after three periods of stress), 47 (after six periods of stress), and 64 days in Experiment I and only after six periods of drought stress in Experiment II. Results indicated that drought stress that was initiated at vegetative growth stage reduced plant height, branches number, shoot and root dry weight, and peanut yield. Sensitivity index calculated based on peanut yield showed that peanut cv. Jerapah and Singa were a medium tolerance while Gajah, Kelinci, Macan, and Simpai were sensitive against drought stress. Higher increased in leaf proline content after drought stress was observed in peanut cv. Jerapah and Singa, while less increased was observed in peanut cv. Gajah, Kelinci, Macan and Simpai. Total leaf sugar content of peanut cv. Jerapah, Gajah, Macan and Simpai decreased under drought stress while that of Singa and Kelinci were the same as that under optimal condition.

The experiment has been conducted by exposing the audible sound for 8 h in 22 days to microalgae cultivation. The result showed that microalgae H. pluvialis treated by the music “Blues for Elle” shows the highest growth rate (0.03 per day), and 58% higher than the one without audible sound. The average number of cells in stationary phase is 0.76 × 104 cells/mL culture and the productivity is 3.467 × 102 cells/mL/day. The pH of microalgae medium slightly decreases because of proton production during photosynthesis process. The kinetic rate constant (kapp) is 0.078 per day, reaction half-life (t1/2) is 8.89 days, and catalytic surface (Ksurf) is 1.66 × 10−5/day/cm2.

Approaches in cardiovascular disease treatment are preventing the formation or removing the thrombus. The present thrombolytic agents can be classified as plasminogen activators, fibrinolytic enzyme which directly degrades fibrinogen or fibrin and heparin type which act as thrombin inhibitor. Recently, microbial fibrinolytic enzymes of food origin receive more attention that leads to escalating efforts to explore traditional fermented foods as the natural sources. We have successfully isolated microorganism from Indonesian fermented soybean tofu dregs “Oncom” that secretes fibrinolytic enzyme. The microorganism identified as Stenotrophomonas sp. is unique because most of the reported fibrinolytic microorganism belongs to Bacillus sp. This isolate was found to produce extracellular fibrinolytic enzyme which could degrade fibrinogen and fibrin directly as determined by fibrinogen zymography and fibrin plate methods. More importantly, the 30-kD purified enzymes was found to demonstrate not only fibrin and fibrinogen degradation capabilities, but also acted as thrombin inhibitor as determined using specific substrates for thrombin. This is the first report of a fibrinolytic enzyme that demonstrates additional synergistic activities.

Wireless communications have become a critical topic of concern because of an increasing number of studies in this field with controversial outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess the genotoxic effect of GSM frequency at 1800 MHz on ovarian function. Sixty female Sprague–Dawley rats were distributed over six groups (control group and the exposure groups with whole-body exposure for 2 h/day, 7 days/week for 15, 30 and 60 continuous days). The study investigated the oxidative stress, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine enzyme, micronuclei formation and histopathological changes in ovarian tissue. The results showed an induced oxidative stress via an increase in lipid peroxidation and decreased antioxidant enzyme activity. There was also an elevation in the 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine enzyme and an increased rate of micronuclei formation in ovarian tissues of exposed animals with 60-day exposure compared with control animals. Cytological changes were recorded such as micronuclei formation, vacuolation, degeneration and impaired folliculogenesis. The study suggests that GSM frequency at 1800 MHz was negatively impacted on female reproductive performances mediated by oxidative stress induction and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine formation leading to overall impaired ovarian function. © 2017 Institut Pertanian Bogor","cytological changes; GSM frequency; micronuclei formation; oxidative DNA damage",,"Alchalabi, A.S.H.; Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, UMK City Campus, Pengkalan Chepa, Locked Bag 36, Malaysia; email: alisaeedchalaby@yahoo.com",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

The research objective was to analyze root morphological and physiological responses of transgenic rice overexpressing B11 gene to Al stress. The experiment was carried out using five rice genotypes including two varieties (Hawara Bunar and IR64) and three T4 generation of transgenic lines, that are T8-2-4, T8-12-5, and T8-15-41. All rice genotypes were grown in nutrient solution for 24 h (adaptation period), and then were exposed to 15 ppm Al for 72 h (treatment period) and recovered in normal nutrient solution for 48 h (recovery period).

However, poor living condition impacts every stage of development, which results in variation in growth rates, growth periods, and body sizes across populations. Baduy is one of traditional populations who inhabit mountainous area in Kanekes Village, Lebak Regency, Banten Province, Indonesia. The traditional obligatory duties and taboos resulted in genetic, geographic, and cultural isolations.

Researchers are also finding difficulties to sort out therapeutic intervention strategies for MERS-CoV. This virus can spread from human to human, but transmission from dromedary camels to humans plays a crucial epidemiological significance. Dromedary camel acts as “gene mixing vessels” for MERS-CoV and these virus particles undergo rapid change in them.

The growth and survival curve analysis revealed that 1.0 M NaCl concentration (sublethal) enacts growth inhibitory effects with prompting immediate delay in cell division cycle; however, yeast cells adopted modified stress physiologically with further stretched stress spans which was accompanied by an upsurge in the level of cellular metabolites such as trehalose (reserve carbohydrate) and chiefly glycerol (polyols) as major compatible osmolytes, suggesting their role in defense mechanism against osmotic stress. To further elucidate the relation of osmotic stress cell physiology to salinity, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, protein carbonyl, and reduced glutathione content were measured in salt-stressed cells demonstrating positive correlation of reactive oxygen species generation in Z. bisporus with an elevated concentration of lipid and protein oxidation, thereby damaging cell membrane and eventually causing cell death. We assessed NaCl exposure sourcing increased intracellular reactive oxygen species concentration, by an electron transfer-based colorimetric cupric-reducing antioxidant capacity assay justifying that cellular total antioxidant capacity which uses all the combined antioxidant activities present within vitamins, proteins, lipids, and glutathione reverses these deleterious stress effects.

Being the major source of energy, fuels are considered the most important. The fear of diminishing the available sources thirst towards biofuel production has increased during last decades. Considering the food problems, algae gain the most attention to be used as biofuel producers. The use of crop and food-producing plants will never be a best fit into the priorities for biofuel production as they will disturb the food needs. Different types of algae having the different production abilities. Normally algae have 20%–80% oil contents that could be converted into different types of fuels such as kerosene oil and biodiesel. The diesel production from algae is economical and easy. Different species such as tribonema, ulothrix and euglena have good potential for biodiesel production. Gene technology can be used to enhance the production of oil and biodiesel contents and stability of algae. By increasing the genetic expressions, we can find the ways to achieve the required biofuel amounts easily and continuously to overcome the fuels deficiency. The present review article focusses on the role of algae as a possible substitute for fossil fuel as an ideal biofuel reactant. © 2017 Institut Pertanian Bogor","algae; biofuel; fossil fuel; gene",,"Yao, L.; Collaborative Innovation Center of Water Security for Water Source Region of Mid-line of South-to-North Diversion Project, College of Agricultural Engineering, Nanyang Normal UniversityChina",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

The as-yet uncultured candidate bacterial genus “Candidatus Entotheonella” of the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei from Japan have recently been recognized as the source of numerous pharmacologically relevant polyketides and modified peptides, as previously reported by the Piel group (Wilson et al. 2014). This work reported the presence of “Candidatus Entotheonella sp.” in the highly complex microbiome of an Indonesian marine sponge from Kapoposang Island, South Sulawesi. We further identified the Kapoposang sponge specimen used in this work as Rhabdastrella sp. based on the integrated morphological, histological, and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene analyses. To detect the polyketide biosynthetic machinery called type I polyketide synthase (PKS) in this Indonesian Rhabdastrella sp., we amplified and cloned the ketosynthase-encoding DNA regions of approximately 700 bp from the uncultured sponge's microbiome. Further sequencing and analysis of several randomly chosen clones indicated that all of them are mostly likely involved in the biosynthesis of methyl-branched fatty acids. However, employing a PKS-targeting primer designed in this work led to the isolation of four positive clones. BlastX search and subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that one of the positive clones, designed as RGK32, displayed high homology with ketosynthase domains of many type I PKS systems and may belong to the subclass cis-AT PKS group. © 2017 Institut Pertanian Bogor","marine sponge; microbiome; polyketide synthase; Rhabdastrella sp.; “Candidatus Entotheonella sp.”",,"Uria, A.R.; Laboratory of Marine Biotechnology, Research Center for Marine and Fisheries Product Processing and Biotechnology, Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, Jalan KS Tubun Petamburan VIIndonesia; email: agustinus.uria@gmail.com",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

The objective of this research is to analyze the use of thidiazuron (TDZ) for producing high number of plantlets, through directly induction of somatic embryos (SEs) from various explants. The method was used 20 each of protocorms, leaves, stems and roots as explants. The explants were dissected transversely, then put on various culture media: New Phalaenopsis (NP) and NP + (1, 2, 3) mgL−1 TDZ. Cultures were maintained at 25°C with continous white light. The formation of SEs was observed every week for 8 weeks. The results showed that SEs formation increased inline with the addition of TDZ concentration to the NP medium, for both velocity and amount of SEs formation. In NP0, SEs were formed at (26.07 ± 0.73) days after inoculation of protocorm, whereas on NP + (1, 2, and 3 mgL−1) TDZ, SEs were formed at (17.85 ± 0.67) days, (15 ± 0.64) days, and (11 ± 0.64) days, respectively. All types of explants formed SEs on NP + TDZ (1–3 mgL−1), whereas only 14 of 20 protocorms produced SEs (70%), and 8 of 20 stems formed SEs (40%) in NP0. In roots, SEs was formed on NP + 2 mgL−1 TDZ and NP + 3 mgL−1 TDZ. For stems, the highest amount of SEs (28.25 ± 1.07) was reached on NP + 3 mgL−1 TDZ, followed by protocorm (23.30 ± 1.13) SEs and roots (8.25 ± 0.68) SEs. In contrast, in NP0, the amount of SEs was very low (1.25 ± 0.46) from stem and (1.50 ± 0.65) from protocorms, there was no evidence of SEs formation in the leaves and roots. © 2017 Institut Pertanian Bogor","New Phalaenopsis medium; Phalaenopsis amabilis orchid; somatic embryo; thidiazuron; various explants",,"Semiarti, E.; Graduate Study Program, Faculty of Biology, Gadjah Mada UniversityIndonesia; email: endsemi@ugm.ac.id",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

Many types of endophytic fungi have been reported as being associated with medicinal plants and able to synthesize secondary metabolites. In this study, endophytic fungi were isolated from all plant parts of turmeric plants. Identification of the endophytic fungi was done using morphological characteristics and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA. The dual culture method was used for screening antibacterial activity of the endophytic fungi against Morganella morganii, a common histamine-producing bacteria. The disc diffusion method was used to test the ability of water fractions of selected endophytic fungi to inhibit M. morganii growth. Two-dimensional thin layer chromatography was used to determine the fungal extract inhibition activity on histamine formation. In total, 11 endophytic fungi were successfully isolated and identified as Arthrobotrys foliicola, Cochliobolus kusanoi, Daldinia eschscholzii, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium proliferatum, Fusarium solani, Fusarium verticillioides, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, and Phaeosphaeria ammophilae. Five isolates showed inhibition activity against M. morganii in the dual culture tests.

However, infection of banana pathogenic fungi (Fusarium oxysporum race 4) is one of the major causes of decreasing production in Indonesia. Genetic engineering has become an alternative way to control this problem by isolating genes that involved in plant defense mechanism against pathogens. Two of the important genes are API5 and ChiI1, each gene encodes apoptosis inhibitory protein and chitinase enzymes. The purpose of this study was to study the expression of API5 and ChiI1 genes as candidate pathogenic resistance genes. The amplified fragments were then cloned, sequenced, and confirmed with in silico studies. Based on sequence analysis, it is showed that partial API5 gene has putative transactivation domain and ChiI1 has 9 chitinase family GH19 protein motifs.

This process needs cognitive functions in thinking, learning, and making decision. Cognitive style is a term to explain human natural preferences in gathering and processing information. Humans appears to reason using two cognitive processing styles; the first system is called as intuitive thinking style that is spontaneous, effortless, and without conscious search, whereas the second system is called as reflective or analytical thinking that works in a deliberate, analytical, procedural, and controllable process. In human context, sometimes people encounter difficult problem or unknown situation that have to be coped by ideas that are both novel and adaptive to the task constraints. People who solve the problem successfully are called creative. Creativity is the base to enhance competitiveness among students that might result in good academic performance.

Land cover changes due to land use can disrupt the natural balance of the ecosystem, which can result in a decrease of cerambycid diversity. Cerambycid species diversity was evaluated in four land types, i.e. jungle-rubber, rubber plantations, oil palm plantations, and felled jungle-rubber. Collections of cerambycid beetles were conducted by using artocarpus trap, made by freshly cut Artocarpus heterophyllus branches. Collections of beetles were made on day 4th, 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th after the traps were set up. In the four land-use types in Jambi province, we collected 72 species including 34 morphospecies of cerambycids, consisting of 42 species from the jungle-rubber, 39 species from rubber plantations, 16 species from oil palm plantations, and 28 species from felled jungle-rubber. Cerambycid diversity was highest in jungle-rubber (H' = 3.23), followed by rubber plantation (H' = 2.67), felled jungle-rubber (H' = 2.38), and oil palm plantations (H' = 2.01).

Specimens from 39 sampling sites were caught using tray net and hand net. There are three species of Caridina found in the lake system, i.e. Caridina linduensis, Caridina kaili and Caridina dali. There is no overlapping distribution among the species. Caridina kaili is a true riverine species and it is never encountered sympatric with C. dali nor C. linduensis. This species is abundant in streams and ditches with moderate flow running water and gravel–cobble substrate. It is mainly spread within streams west to the lake. Both C. dali and C. linduensis can be found in the lake and streams with very slow current to almost stagnant water, muddy sand substrate and associated with roots of water plants and leaf litter. However, C. dali is never occurred together with C. linduensis and they are less abundant compare to C. kaili. Distribution of Caridina spp. in Lake Lindu is probably affected by the temperature of their habitats and the occurrence of introduced fish such as Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), and an alien riceland prawn (Macrobrachium lanchesteri). These introduced and alien species can have the potency to become predators or competitors for the Caridina spp. It is also the first record for M. lanchesteri present in Lake Lindu. © 2016 Institut Pertanian Bogor","Caridina; distribution; endemic; Lake Lindu; Sulawesi",,"Annawaty, A.; Department of Biology, Faculty of Mathematics and Sciences Tadulako UniversityIndonesia; email: annawaty09@gmail.com",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

In such cases, populations are expected to diverge rapidly for hypervariable region I markers because of the smaller effective population size and thus increased genetic drift. This rapid divergence leads to the accumulation of mutations exclusively found in one population, which may serve as diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To date, diagnostic SNPs distinctive to Sumatran orangutan populations have not yet been described. However, given the continuously declining numbers of Sumatran orangutans, this information can be vital for effective conservation measures, especially regarding reintroductions of orangutans in rehabilitation centers. Phylogenetic analyses of 54 samples of Sumatran orangutans from nine sampling sites with good provenance, we found five major clades and a total of 20 haplotypes. We propose a total of 52 diagnostic SNPs that are specific to Sumatran orangutan populations.

However, the luminous disease primarily caused by Vibrio harveyi bacteria still becomes an obstacle in penaeid shrimp farming, especially in shrimp hatchery. This study was aimed to identify the presence of V. harveyi in L. vannamei through nested PCR using haemolysin gene primer. First, initial primers were designed using V. harveyi VIB 391 haemolysin gene sequence (accession number: DQ640264), flanking the position 133 to 756. This primer pairs were used to identify haemolysin gene in both V. harveyi MR5339 and V. harveyi 275 strain. Sequencing results from each sample showed 99% similarity with haemolysin gene sequence in Genebank. Furthermore, the sequence of V. harveyi MR5339 haemolysin gene was used to design the nested PCR primers. The first primer pairs of nested PCR have successfully amplified the haemolysin gene fragment of all V. harveyi strains samples from position 52 to 405. The second primer pairs of nested PCR have amplified position 204 to 405 where it can detect all of V. harveyi strains used as sample sources in this study.

The objectives of this study were to analyse and compare the bioactive compounds and α-glucosidase inhibitory effect of four different types of Swietenia mahagoni seed extract, and to analyse the hypoglycemic activity of the greatest inhibition of α-glucosidase-extract in rats. The extracts were obtained using two different solvents (aqueous and ethanol) and two different methods: maceration and reflux methods. This resulted in four types of extract varying by solvent and extraction method. Testing of these extracts for α-glucosidase inhibitory effect was carried out in vitro using spectrophotometer. Testing for hypoglycemic activity was carried out in vivo using rats. A total of 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into eight groups: (1) the negative control group, received an oral dose of aquadest only, (2) the positive control group, was given 90% sucrose orally without S. mahagoni seed extract, and five treated groups (3-7), were given 90% sucrose followed by the best extract-ethanolic S. mahagoni seed extract in doses of 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 mg/kgBW, and (8) the acarbose group, was given 90% sucrose orally followed by acarbose.

In each plot, macrolichens were observed in 8 canary trees using 2 mini quadrats (32 × 20 cm2). The population conditions of epiphytic macrolichens were analyzed and to be used as bioindicator of air quality. Seven genera of macrolichens were found: Coccocarpia, Leptogium, Canoparmelia, Parmotrema, Dirinaria, Physcia, and Pyxine. Plot 1 was having Coccocarpia and Leptogium that were not found in other plots and therefore they can be used as sensitive bioindicators, none of Canoparmelia and Pyxine, a few and infrequent Dirinaria but with larger average coverage (AC = 6.15 cm2), and Physcia was found abundantly (sensitive bioindicator). Conversely, plot 2 and 3 were having none of Coccocarpia and Leptogium, few or many Canoparmelia and Pyxine and therefore appeared to be tolerant, many and frequent Dirinaria but with smaller AC (plot 2 = 2.85 cm2, plot 3 = 1.16 cm2), and few or none of Physcia was found. Being found in all plots, Dirinaria showed a clear pattern of increasing thallus number and decreasing AC from plot 1 to plot 3, so it can be used as tolerant bioindicator. Conversely, Parmotrema had unclear pattern of population condition.

The bone structure of the skull along with various soft tissues and coloration influence perception of the face. Facial averageness, and bilateral symmetry are the two most commonly used criterion of facial attractiveness, yet, both may be perceived differently based on hormonal status of the person observed. Facial perceptions may also differ according to cultural norms. In this research, we examined variations in face-shape among Sundanese male and female adults aged 18 to 40. We applied geometric-morphometric methods to analyze the landmark-based morphological variations in the frontal and lateral views of subjects’ faces. We identified five types of female frontal face views and four of male. We also identified five types each of female and male lateral face views. The trichion, gonion and gnathion were three most variable landmarks among the face views in our study, and highly determined the shape of the individuals’ faces. Multiple face type variation may refer to many categories of attractive faces since there is no exactly perfect category in the assessment of facial attractiveness by the viewers.

The objective of this study was to quantify IgA gene expression at both the transcription and translation levels in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats supplemented with tempeh. A total of 6 female SD rats were divided into 3 groups of 2 rats. The first group was the control and was fed a standard diet without tempeh. The second- and third group were fed with a standard diet supplemented with raw and cooked tempeh, respectively. Ileum tissue samples were collected after tempeh supplementation for 28 days. RNA was extracted from ileum samples, and measurement of IgA gene expression was further analyzed using semi quantitative real-time PCR. The concentration of IgA protein was quantified from ileum lysate using the half sandwich ELISA method. IgA gene expressions in rats supplemented with raw, and with cooked tempeh, were 1.18 and 1.17 fold higher, respectively, compared to the control group. Moreover, IgA protein secretion levels also increased 2.46 and 2.08 fold, respectively, compared to the control group.

Several species associate with cultivated plants and have potential to become pests. The systematic of this genus is still in dispute, especially on the monophyly and the relationship within this genus due to the fact that it is very large genus (137 described species). To clarify the monophyly of the genus Arctornis, and to reveal the phylogenetic relationship among the Indonesian species, we analyzed ten species of Indonesian Arctonis involving seven other species distributed around the world based on a 600 bp region in the COI gene. The results showed that the monophyly of Arctornis was supported by a high bayesian partition test at Maximum likelihood tree building method. The relationship among groups was supported by moderate to high bayesian partition values. Indeed, COI gene was very useful to characterize Arctornis species, especially to distinguish member of Indonesian species. Nevertheless, this should be taken with precaution because more species and more conserved genes should be involved in the future analysis to test the validity of the proposed phylogeny. © 2015 Institut Pertanian Bogor","Arctornis; COI gene; phylogenetic relationship",,"SUTRISNO, H.A.R.I.; Laboratory of Entomology, Division of Zoology, Research Center for Biology, The Indonesian Institute of Sciences, Jalan Raya Bogor Km 46, Indonesia; email: sutrisnohari@yahoo.com",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

During preprotein transport in the cytosol, chaperones, such as heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), are functioning to prevent aggregation and to maintain the correct protein folding of preproteins. This research was conducted in order to understand the chaperone-mediated, post-translational import of preproteins into the endoplasmic reticulum of Arabidopsis thaliana. AtTPR7 (Arabidopsis thaliana Tetratrico Peptide Repeat 7) is found in the endoplasmic reticulum and contains TPR domain, which mediates protein interaction with cytosolic Hsp70 and Hsp90. In this study, recombinant AtTPR7 was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3)-RIPL cells and purified using an N-terminal His-tag. In order to study the interactions of the protein with the chaperones, we used pulldown and Western blot assays.

The objective of this research was to find the best combination of medium and plant growth regulator for in vitro growth and rooting of mangosteeen seed. Various types of explant (a whole seed; seed divided into 2, 3, and 4 cross sections; seed divided into 2, 3, and 4 longitudinal sections) were treated with five concentrations of benzyl amino purine (BAP; 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 mg/L) for shoot induction in ½ Nitrogen (N) Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. The shoots were rooted on MS and woody plant medium (WPM) media with several combinations of indole butyric acid (IBA) and naphtalene acetic acid (NAA). Treatments for root induction were applied as follows: (i) low dose, given during induction of rooting, (ii) soaking the base of the shoots in medium treated with a high dose of auxin for 5 days, and then growing the shoots in MS ½ N with 1 mg/L NAA + 1 mg/L BAP medium. Our result show that BAP positively affected mangosteen bud growth. The best medium for mangosteen shoot regeneration was found to be MS ½ N + 5 mg/L BAP. This medium induced the highest number of shoots from the seed explant cut into four cross sections. We found the best medium to induce in vitro rooting of mangosteen shoot was MS ½ N + 3 mg/L indole butiric acid (IBA) + 4 mg/L NAA medium. Some treatment negatively affected growth. Soaking the mangosteen shoot base in a medium with an overly high dose of auxin seemed to disrupt and inhibit growth of the mangosteen shoot. © 2014 Institut Pertanian Bogor","auxin; cytokinin; mangosteen; tissue culture",,"HARAHAP, F.A.U.Z.I.Y.A.H.; Department of Biology, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, State University of Medan, Jalan Willem Iskandar Psr V, Indonesia; email: fauziyahharahap@gmail.com",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

A point mutation in the mitochondrial gene Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase 1 (mtDNA ND1) gene mainly reported as the most common mutation related to T2DM. However, several studies have identified another SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) in the RNA region of mtDNA from patients from specific ethnic populations in Indonesia. Building on those findings, this study aimed to use PCR and DNA sequencing technology to identify nucleotides in RNA and ND1 fragment from 20 Gorontalonese and 20 Javanese T2DM patients, that may trigger T2DM expression. The results showed successful amplification of RNA along 294 bp for all samples. From these samples, we found two types of point mutation in Javanese patients in the G3316A and T3200C points of the rRNA and ND1 gene. In samples taken from Gorontalonese patients, no mutation were found in the RNA or ND1 region. We conclude that T2DM was triggered differently in our two populations. While genetic mutation is implicated for the 20 Javanese patients, T2DM pathogenesis in the Gorontalonese patients must be traced to other genetic, environmental, or behavioral factors. © 2014 Institut Pertanian Bogor","Gorontalonese; Javanese; mtDNA ND1 fragment gene; type 2 diabetes mellitus",,"PUSPITANINGRUM, R.I.N.I.; Department of Biology, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Universitas Negeri Jakarta, Jalan Pemuda 10 Rawamangun, Indonesia; email: rini_puspitaningrum@yahoo.com",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

Some research indicates it may play a role in increasing the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy treatment. P53 is a tumor suppressor protein that influences the cell cycle and apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the expression of Akt and p53 in cancerous tissue before chemoradiation treatment, and the clinical response to treatment of cervical cancer patients. Twenty microscopic tissue samples were taken from cervical cancer biopsies obtained from patients before cancer treatment. The tissue samples were stained with p53 and Akt antibodies via immunohistochemistry technique, to measure expression of both proteins. After completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients’ clinical response to treatment was determined using the pelvic control method. Our results revealed no correlation between expression of Akt and p53 index (P = 0.74) as well as between p53 Index and chemoradiotherapy clinical response (P=0.29). There was significant correlation between expression of Akt and cervical cancer chemoradiotherapy response (P = 0.03).

Our results showed that children living at low altitude were taller and heavier than children of the same age living at medium and high altitudes. Up until the onset of puberty, the children at medium altitude have similar stature and weight to those residing at high altitude, but they are shorter and lighter thereafter. There were significant differences in the height and weight of girls in different altitude locations, but no significant difference for boys. The effect of SES on child growth can be comparison between Sasak and other populations in Indonesia. In general, the Sasak children are shorter and lighter than children of the same age in urban populations, and relatively similar in size to the children in rural populations.

In addition, the ammonia concentration produced by strain 100A and 100D were 180.20 and 54.10 mM, respectively. These results were supported by molecular characterization using specific primers, where strain 100A and 100D positively contain genes encoding α-nitrile hydratase (α-NHase) and amidase. There was a difference at the first position of amino acid composition of the gene encoding α-NHase between strain 100A (Methionine1) and strain 100D (Glycine1), but the amino acids composition of amidase of both strain were identical. This is the first report of R. aff. qingshengii as nitrile-degrading bacterium in Indonesia. © 2014 Institut Pertanian Bogor","16S rRNA; biotransformation; nitrilases; nitrile; Rhodococcus",,"HASTUTY, A.; Microbiology Division, Research Center for Biology, Indonesian Institute of Sciences-LIPI, Jalan Raya Bogor Km 46, Indonesia; email: mima_hdy@yahoo.com",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

Aim of this research was to investigate the most suitable irradiation dose to attenuated P. berghei based on the the histological changes in the liver mouse malaria model. Histological changes in mice liver because of Plasmodium is congestion in the sinusoids and masses of hemozoin. Fourty Swiss mice were randomly assigned to four equal groups. First group of mice were inoculated with the unirradiated malaria parasites as a positive control while negative control group represented uninfected normal control. The third group of mice was inoculated with the irradiated malaria parasites with dose 175 Gy. Last group were inoculated with the irradiated malaria parasites with dose 150 Gy. Mice were sacrificed at day 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 post inoculation for liver histological study. Their livers processed for histomorphometric assessment of sinusoidal area, haemozoin area and hepatosomatic index as a quantitative measure of altered morphology. Hepatic sinusoidal area in mice infected with the unirradiated malaria parasites increased by 104% in day 24 post inoculated compared to day 6 post inoculated, whereas a smaller increase of 46% occurred in mice that were inoculated with the irradiated malaria parasites with dose 150 Gy. The difference between positive control and 150 Gy group was significant (P < 0.05). The highest average haemozoin area in all days post inoculation was in positive control whereas a smaller occurred in mice that were inoculated with the irradiated malaria parasites with dose 175 Gy, but the different was not significant (P > 0.05).

Nine male cats weighing between 3.3-4.4 kg were anesthetized using zolazepam-tiletamine. Echocardiographic examinations were taken on the right parasternal short axis view at the papillary muscle and aorta level using a 7.5 MHz transducer. Result showed that the wall thickness, left ventricular internal diameter and fractional shortening of the Indonesian DHC were similar compared with those in other cat breeds with the same average weight. The left atrium internal diameter and the aorta diameter of the Indonesian DHC were relatively smaller. However, the left atrium and aorta diameter ratio were similar to the result in other cat breeds with the same average weight. Through this study, we also could specify the left ventricular volume, stroke volume, cardiac output and ejection fraction that not yet reported before. © 2013 Institut Pertanian Bogor","heart; Indonesian domestic house cat; motion mode echocardiography; normal values",,"NOVIANA, D.E.N.I.; Division of Surgery and Radiology, Departement of Clinic, Reproduction, and Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Bogor Agricultural University, Darmaga Campus, Indonesia; email: deni@ipb.ac.id",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

A study on fish distribution was carried out in the upper Citarum River to map the effects of physio-chemical properties on habitat use. A survey was conducted to collect fish and to measure the water quality both on dry and rainy season. The result showed that distribution of the fish, in general, represented their adaptive response to physico-chemical properties. The river environment could be grouped into two categories: (i) clean and relatively unpolluted sites, which associated with high DO and water current, and (ii) polluted sites characterized by low DO, high COD, BOD, water temperature, NO3, PO4, H2S, NH3, and surfactant. Fish inhabiting the first sites were Xiphophorus helleri, Punctius binotatus, Xiphophorus maculatus, and Oreochromis mossambicus. Meanwhile, the latter sites were inhabited by Liposarcus pardalis, Trichogaster trichopterus, and Poecilia reticulata.

Systematic data on feeding and ranging behaviour were collected from August 2009 up to February 2010 for the three groups of two sympatric primate species that shared two neighbouring patches. Our results showed that seven types of habitat in CPRS were affected to both primates, particularly in plant utilization for feed and the use of vertical space patterns. If the leaf monkeys were present in the same forest patch, the Bornean white-bearded gibbons showed a reduced within-group dispersal and significantly less foraging time in a given forest patch. This might be due to the bornean white-bearded gibbons were more selective in their diet selection. When fruits were scarce, bornean white-bearded gibbons spent most of their foraging time in many types of forest ecosystem, while leaf monkey foraged within one or two types of forest ecosystem. At this period, diet and habitat overlaps between the two species were low. When the availability of fruits increased, leaf monkeys shifted their foraging range and both species became confined to the forest habitat. Consequently, the overlaps of diets and habitats were increased while the peak was at the end of the fruit season. © 2012 Institut Pertanian Bogor","Cohabitation; CPRS; Hylobates albibarbis; Presbytis rubicunda; sympatric species",,"RAHMAN, D.A.; Wildlife Ecology Laboratory, Department of Forest Resource Conservation and Ecotourisme, Faculty of Forestry, Bogor Agricultural University, Darmaga Campus, Indonesia; email: dede_fahutanipb@mail.com",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

Menarche (first event of menstruation) and spermarche (first event of nocturnal sperm emission) are usually used as indicators of gonad maturation. We found that median age at menarche of Arfak girls in Manokwari, West Papua is 12.2 years, while median age at spermarche of boys is 13.6 years. A possible factor causing young age at menarche is due to adaptation to unstable environmental conditions because of high risk of mortality by malaria disease during childhood. The events of menarche and spermarche achieved one year after the peak body height (BH) velocity, and just before or at the same time with the time of maximum growth rate of body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), and BF. The average BMI of Arfak girls was big at 21.9 kg/m2 at the time of their menarche. Bigger average BMI might be caused by prepubertal slowing down of BH growth compare to growth of BW whichis still increasing. Girls accumulate BF before puberty to be used as an energy reserve for the occurrence of menarche. At the time of development of secondary sexual characters girls use the fat reserve so it decline sharply after puberty. In boys, growth rate of BF was stopped at 11 years old, and then growing negatively presumably because boys use fat mass for the occurence of spemarche. BF growth rate reached the lowest point at the age 16 years old, and then increase linearly with age through adolescence until adulthood at age 23 years old. © 2012 Institut Pertanian Bogor","Arfak; body fat; body height; body weight; menarche; spermarche",,"KAWULUR, E.I.J.J.; Department of Biology, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, Bogor Agricultural University, Darmaga Campus, Indonesia; email: irmakawulur@yahoo.com",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

However, it is still underutilized. Tissue culture of sago through somatic embryogenesis has been developed. The plantlets derived from somatic embryos, however, are usually weak with few leaves and roots and have low survival rates during acclimatization. Carbohydrate is commonly added into culture medium as an energy source and an osmotic agent. Research was conducted to determine a suitable carbohydrate for plantlets growth in order to produce vigorous plantlets of sago. The basal medium used was a modified MS medium with a half-strength of salts. Different types of carbohydrate (sucrose, maltose, glucose, and fructose) at various concentrations (30, 45, and 60 g/l) were added into the medium. A single 2 cm plantlet derived from somatic embryo was cultured on a culture tube. Each treatment consisted of 15 plantlets. The cultures were incubated in a culture room with light intensity at 20 μmol/m2/s and temperature at 26 °C. The results show that different types and concentrations of carbohydrate influenced the growth of sago plantlets significantly, but there was no interaction between the two factors. Sucrose was better than other types of carbohydrate, and the concentration of 30 g/l was better than concentrations of 45 or 60 g/l for the growth and vigor of sago plantlets.

Corpora lutea were collected and classified into stages of early, developing, mid, late, and regressed. Messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of DBH were studied throughout the estrous cycle. Additionally, DBH protein expression was examined in cultured mid luteal cells after tumour necrosis factor alpha/interferon gamma (TNFα/IFNγ)-induced apoptosis or after treatment with NGF, IGF1, and TGFβ1. DBH mRNA and protein expressions were detected throughout the cycle without significant changes in the protein level while mRNA showed a decrease at the developing stage (P < 0.05). Interestingly, NGF, IGF1, and TGFβ1 increased DBH expression in cultured luteal cells (P < 0.05).

Histochemical stainings were observed to analysis aluminum accumulation, lipid peroxidation and the loss of plasma membrane integrity on the surface and tissue of the root apex. Enzymatic analysis was conducted to measure malate content in leaf, root and malate efflux in the medium. We used M. malabathricum as a comparison for Al-tolerance plant. J. curcas root elongation was inhibited by 0.4 mM AlCl3, while M. malabathricum root elongation was inhibited by 0.8 mM AlCl3 treatment. Inhibition of root elongation has high correlation with Al accumulation in the root apex, which caused lipid degradation and cell death. Generally, malate content in J. curcas leaf and root was higher than that in M. malabathricum. In the contrary malate efflux from the root into the medium was lower. J. curcas root has a different pattern compared to M. malabathricum in malate synthesis and malate secretion when treated with a different Al concentration.

The function of Zinc (Zn) as cofactor of several enzyme systems such as extracellular carbonic anhydrase (extracellular CA) which catalyzes the interconversion of HCO3 − and CO2. Concentrations of dissolved Zn in oligothropic waters are often very low therefore may limit the growth of zooxanthellae and their ability to fix CO2 from seawater via the carbonic anhydrase. The aim of this research is to investigate the effect of various concentrations of Zn on the growth and extracellular CA activity in zooxanthellae. Cell density was monitored daily by enumeration with hemocytometer-type chamber (0.1 mm). Extracellular CA was measured in homogenized intact whole cell by a pH drift assay. Results revealed that Zn status strongly influences the growth rate and extracelullar CA activity in zooxanthellae. The specific growth rate and cell density increased two-fold whilst extracelullar CA activity increased 10.5 times higher than that in control with increasing concentrations of Zn from 0 to 80 nM, but decreased when Zn was over 80 nM.

We developed a selective medium for quantitative in vitro activity evaluation of bacterial biocontrol agents against pathogenic Vibrio in aquaculture. Sensitivity test of bacterial biocontrol and Vibrio spp. to nine antibiotics showed that oxytetracycline inhibited the growth of Vibrio spp., but did not inhibit the growth of the bacterial biocontrol. This selective inhibition activity of oxytetracycline suggested this antibiotic might be supplemented to establish a selective medium. The MIC of oxytetracycline against V. harveyi, V. parahaemolyticus, and V. algosus were 120, 250, and 120 μg/ml, respectively. These concentration did not inhibit the growth of bacterial biocontrols. Therefore, oxytetracycline was supplemented at 250 μg/ml in Zobell agar medium. This medium was used as a selective medium to enumerate the density of bacterial biocontrol. In vitro activity test of bacterial biocontrol (RLP1) against V. parahaemolyticus showed that strain RLP1 at density of 104 and 106 cells/ml was able to kill V. parahaemolyticus during 6 h incubation. At lower density, 102 cells/ml, this bacterial biocontrol agent was able to kill the pathogenic Vibrio during 12 h incubation.

In this study, a giant gourami (Osphronemus goramy) vasa-like gene (GgVLG) was cloned and characterized for use as a molecular marker for germ cells in this species. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that GgVLG comprises 2,340 bps with an open reading frame of 1,962 bps encoding 653 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence contained 17 arginine-glycine or arginine-glycine-glycine motifs and eight conserved motifs belonging to the DEAD-box protein family. The GgVLG sequence showed high similarity to Drosophila vasa, common carp vasa homolog and tilapia vasa homolog for 66.2, 85.9, and 90.7%, respectively. In adult tissues, the GgVLG transcripts were specifically detected in ovary and testis. In situ hybridization analysis showed that GgVLG mRNA was detected in oocytes of the ovary and spermatogonia of the testis.

Subunit 8 of yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase is a hydrophobic protein of 48 amino acids encoded by the mitochondrial ATP8 gene. A dual control allotopic expression system for subunit 8 has been developed. The strategy involves maintenance of two different compatible yeast expression vectors each utilizing a different inducible promoter in the same host cells. The system thus enables cloning and allotopic expression of two different forms of subunit 8 gene. The goal of the developed strategy is to permit allotopic expression of functional wildtype subunit 8 gene under a conditional promoter system and subunit 8 variant gene under the control of a different promoter system. The system is potentially useful for accurate assessment of assembly behavior of functionally defective subunit 8 variants in vivo. The strategy relies on the ability to conditionally regulate the expression of the two genes.

The time and harvesting techniques, drying process after harvesting, and processing to make the simplicia, are the crucial role to make the good quality of the natural product. On the other hand, there is a lack of general understanding and appreciation about the processes involved in governing shoot and tree growth and development, i.e. red guava. The research objective was to evaluate the influence of leaf harvesting and growth phases on red guava for flavonoid production as antioxidant. Randomized factorial block design in time were laid out with two factors and followed by Duncan's multiple range test. The treatments were the amount of leaf harvested on tertiary branches (0, 25, 50, and 100%) and growth phases of the plant (vegetative and generative). Leaf harvesting 25% on tertiary branches significantly increased the leaf number (766.3 tree−1) and the number of new quarternary branches, decreasing leaf area index (LAI) and leaf dry weight at the end of the experiment (22 weeks of observation/WO). The highest leaf dry weight (156.94 g tree−1) and LAI (0.47) was found in harvesting 25% tertiary branches. Harvesting 100% leaf on tertiary branches in vegetative phase significantly produced the lowest flavonoid production (7.82 g tree−1). The result suggested that flavonoid production from red guava leaves should be done by harvesting 50% leaf on tertiary branches in generative phase can be used to produce the highest flavonoid (89.90 g tree−1). © 2011 Institut Pertanian Bogor","growth phases; harvest; leaf flavonoid; red guava",,"AZIZ, S.A.; Department of Agronomy and Horticulture, Faculty of Agriculture, Bogor Agricultural University, Kampus Darmaga, Indonesia; email: sandraaziz@yahoo.com",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

Zymographic analysis of secreted enzymes identified the main caseinolytic band at 54 kDa. Macelignan inhibited the expression of uPA protein and mRNA, as well uPA secretion, in KB cells exposed to P. gingivalis supernatant. Consistent with these findings, macelignan suppressed phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) in P. gingivalis supernatant-induced KB cells. The levels of c-Fos and phosphorylated c-Jun, which together form AP-1, the transcription factor that is involved in uPA gene expression, were partially reduced by macelignan. Macelignan also blocked P. gingivalis supernatant-induced AP-1 activity in these cells. These results suggest that macelignan decreased P. gingivalis supernatant-induced uPA expression by blocking AP-1 activity, which may be mediated by inhibition of phosphorylation of p38 and JNK in KB cells.

Physical interactions between yeast Pichia guilliermondii and postharvest fruit pathogen Penicillium expansum in culture were studied in detail using light and transmission electron microscope to give better understanding on their mode of antagonism. Both organisms were co-cultured for 24-hr on potato dextrose agar. Light microscopy observations on the co-culture showed that the yeast cells attached firmly on the fungal hyphae. This attachment was inhibited by several substances such as enzymes degrading protein (protease or trypsin), a respiration inhibitor (sodium azide), an acid (hydrochloric acid) or an alkali (sodium hydroxide). Although autoclaved hyphae did not affect the attachment, but boiled enzymes and autoclaved yeast cells totally abolished the attachment. These evidences suggested that the attachment might be an active process mediated by certain protein from live yeast cells. Transmission electron micrographs on the ultrastructure of the co-culture revealed that the hyphae showed abnormalities in their structure and organelles, and a degree of obvious damage.

Herbalox® supplemented diet showed no harmful effects on growth or survival of zebrafish. However, the diet could not inhibit Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) formation in zebrafish during post-mortem storage at 4 °C. Dietary Herbalox® and Vinlife® supplementation also showed no deleterious effects on growth or survival of zebrafish. The Vinlife® supplementation efficiently suppressed TBARS formation in the zebrafish but the Herbalox® supplementation. The two novel antioxidants had significant effects on catalase and glutathione S-transferase but not on glutathione peroxidase. These findings suggested that the supplementation with Vinlife® was more effective than with Herbalox® in inhibiting the formation of lipid oxidation products in zebrafish.

This research were conducted to investigate progeny, immature development period, longevity of female parasitoids of L. sativae, and to study female parasitoid behaviour in host finding. Host finding behaviour was observed by examining their visit frequency to the leaves that mined by leafminer larvae and healthy leaves. Results showed that H. varicornis produced more progenies (10.70 ± 2.58 progenies/female), but not significantly different (P < 0.05) from progenies produced by G. micromorpha (9.90 ± 3.81 progenies/female) and O. dissitus (9.60 ± 3.31 progenies/female). The immature development period of G. micromorpha (25.65 ± 0.38 days) was found to be longer than H. varicornis (16.14 ± 1.20 days) and O. dissitus (14.03 ± 0.22 days). Significant different (P = 0.1014) of adult longevity was not found among H. varicornis (9.22 ± 2.48 days), G. micromorpha (7.25 ± 1.34 days), and O. dissitus (8.74 ± 2.18 days).

The aim of this study is to determine the reproductive potential of lola snail in Saparua Island, Central Maluku. Lola snails were collected from six locations i.e Booi, Haria, Ullath, Ouw, Itawaka, and Nolloth (03.29°-03.80° LT dan 128.32°-128.43° BT). In each location a strip transect 100 × 2 m was made perpendicular to the coastline started from the lower tide level. Lola snail populations were grouped into different age classes based on the shell diameter using Bhattacharya method. The reproductive potential of lola snail was analyzed by the value of the net reproductive rate. Gonad histology analyses were made by using paraffin methods and stained by Ehrlich's Haematoxylin-Eosin. The results showed that the net reproductive rate of lola population is 226 individuals and its generation time is 2.88 years.

Untreated and matriconditioned seeds were soaked in 5 mM 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) for various time at 25 °C to studies the time course of ACC-derived ethylene production. To study the performance of the seeds at high temperature, they were planted at temperature regime of 35 °C, 12h light/27 °C, 12h dark. The ACC-oxidase activity of the seeds after incubated in ACC at 35 °C was also determined. The ACC contents in untreated and matriconditioned seeds during the 24h imbibition period at 35 °C were monitored. No ethylene was detected during soaking of pepper seeds in the absence of ACC. In 5 mM ACC detectable levels of ethylene were produced; the matriconditioned seeds producing 10-fold larger amounts than the untreated seeds at the time of germination. It is postulated that matriconditioning greatly increases the ACC-oxidase activity at the time of germination. Matriconditioned seeds imbibed at 35 °C produced larger amounts of ACC and greater ACC-oxidase activity than the untreated seeds. Thus, the basis for the thermotolerance by matriconditioned seeds may be increasing ability to synthesize ACC and to utilize it for ethylene production and stress alleviation. © 2006 Institut Pertanian Bogor","ACC-derived ethylene production; ACC-oxidase; germination; preplant conditioning",,,,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

Previous study showed that Rojolele can be cultured and regenerated in vitro. Two cry genes, cryIB-cryIAa were fused and introduced into rice cv. Rojolele in an attempt to improve resistance and to obtain durable resistance rice against the yellow stem borer. Two-week old embryogenic calli of Rojolele rice were inoculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens harbored with binary vector pCAMBIA 1301, 1303, or 1304 carrying cryIB-cryIAa hybrid gene, hygromycin resistant gene (hpt), and β-glucuronidase (gus) gene interrupted with an intron. The transformed calli were selected gradually on medium containing hygromycin (50, 100 mg/l) and regenerated on medium containing 0.5 mg/l IAA and 0.3 mg/l BAP. GUS activity in infected calli was detected by histochemical assay 3 days after inoculation. The highest (100%) transformation efficiency were obtained from calli transformed with pCAMBIA 1303 and 1304. Thirty four out of 77 transformed shoots were tested positive for the cryIB-cryIAa gene using PCR analysis. These shoots were grown in the soil to maturity and to collect the seeds. PCR analysis of the T1 progeny revealed that two out of six lines tested showed a Mendelian segregation pattern. These two lines were also potentially resistant to yellow stem borer based on bioassay in planta. © 2006 Institut Pertanian Bogor","cryIB-cryIAa hybrid gene; yellow stem borer",,"RAHMAWATI, S.; Pusat Penelitian Bioteknologi, Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia, Jalan Raya Bogor Km. 46, Indonesia; email: syamsidah_rahmawati@yahoo.com",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English; Indonesian","Hayati J.

The research was performed using fresh harvested seeds. Prestorage seed invigorations were conducted by matriconditioning with water or antioxidants solution i.e. 4.17% curcumin or 100 and 150 ppm ascorbic acid. The seeds were stored for four months at room condition (28-29 °C and 62-79% relative humidity). Observations were conducted monthly. Experiment was arranged in split plot design. The result showed that all prestorage seed invigoration treatments were not effective to enhance storability of sunflower seeds compared to control. Inefficiency exogenous antioxidants was probably due to highly endogenous antioxidants activity during storage. This was indicated by the slow deterioration rate of control seeds, or due to high concentration of curcumin which was actually potential to enhance storability of sunflower seeds.

Gassed oocytes over 22h maturation (T3) cleaved higher (72.22 ± 3.36%) than ungassed oocytes in T1 and T2, i.e., 62.12 ± 3.38% and 60.00 ± 3.00%, respectively (p&lt;0.05). Limitation of CO2 during IVM did not affect the ability of oocytes to develop to blastocysts following in vitro fertilization (IVF) and in vitro culture (IVC) (34.48 ± 2.9% vs. 33.00 ± 2.5% vs. 36.50 ± 3.0%, respectively for T1, T2, and T3; P&gt;0.05). This study suggests that it is possible to mature ovine oocytes in the absence of CO2 without loss its potensial development. It may therefore be an effective method of maturing ovine oocytes during transportation to IVP (in vitro production) laboratory. © 2005 Institut Pertanian Bogor",,,,,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English","Hayati J.

Some introgression lines derived from A. cardenasii and A. hypogaea hybridization have been introduced to Indonesia. Evaluation of their adaptability and yield potential were necessary before pursuing further utilization of these introgression lines. The objectives of this research were to determine yield potential of the introgression lines of peanut in green house and field conditions and to evaluate incidence of PStV infection in the field. Peanut plants were grown in the green house and in the field according to standard procedures for raising peanut. Results of the experiments showed that growth and developmental characters of the tested lines were similar between field and green house grown plants. The introgression lines generally exhibited higher secondary branches and longer to flower and harvest as compared to peanut cv. Gajah and Kelinci. The NC-CS30 line was identfied as having higher yield and bigger seed size as compared to standard peanut cultivars (Gajah and Kelinci). Therefore, NC-CS30 germplasm may be further developed as commercial peanut cultivar or be used as donor for peanut breeding in Indonesia. © 2005 Institut Pertanian Bogor",,,"SUDARSONO; Departemen Budi Daya Pertanian, Faperta, Institut Pertanian Bogor, Kampus Darmaga, Indonesia; email: agrspsipb@indo.net.id",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English; Indonesian","Hayati J.

The purposes of this study was to evaluate an quality of frozen-thawed sperm of garut ram which was collected from cauda epididymis and cryopreserved with modified Tris extender, i.e: Tris extender (control, KT), Tris extender + 60 mM lactose (LS), and Tris extender + 60 mM lactose + 0.05% glutathione (GL). Quality of collected sperm including concentration, motility, live sperm, abnormality, cytoplasmic droplet, intact acrosomal cap (IAC), and intact plasma membrane (IPM) were evaluated. Results showed that mean of sperm concentration, percentages of motility, live sperm, abnormality, cytoplasmic droplet, IAC, and IPM of fresh epididymal sperm were 13,993.33 million/ml, 70.83, 82.83, 10.83, 8.5, 85.83, and 81.33%, respectively. Sperm quality after equilibration for LS and GL were significantly (P<0.05) higher than KT. Mean percentages of post thawing sperm motility, live sperm, IAC, and IPM for GL (45, 54.5, 47.83, and 48.83%) were significantly (P<0.05) higher than LS (40, 49.17, 43.83, and 44.5%), and KT (35, 42.5, 39.17, and 41.5%). Mean percentages of post thawing sperm motility, live sperm, IAC, and IPM for LS were significantly (P<0.05) higher than those of KT. Hence, frozen-thawed epididymal sperm of garut ram after slaughter and cryopreserved with Tris extender + 60 mM lactose (LS) and Tris extender + 60 mM lactose + 0.05% glutathione (GL) possibly can be used for artificial insemination (AI) or in vitro embryo production program. © 2005 Institut Pertanian Bogor",,,"RIZAL, M.; Jurusan Peternakan, Faperta, Universitas Pattimura, Kampus Poka, Jalan Ir.

This technology was then applied to the preservation of embryo, oocyte, ovary and testis. The application of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) for which sperm motility is unnecessary had supported the effort to create simplified method such as freeze-drying for sperm preservation. Due to the benefit of ICSI over the conventional in vitro fertilization (IVF) the spermatozoon could be mechanically driven to pass through the zona pellucida and entering the cytoplasm of oocytes prior to fertilization. The freeze-drying method is an alternative method in sperm preservation which ignored the motility of sperm. The sperm resulted from this technique is in drying state, therefore, it might be stored in room temperature or in refrigerator. Many reports have claimed that freeze-dried sperm which is not motile but has an intact DNA was able to fertilize oocytes, even produced offspring in mouse. © 2005 Institut Pertanian Bogor",,,"SAILI, T.; Program Studi Produksi Ternak, Faperta, Universitas HaluoleoIndonesia; email: takdir69@yahoo.com",,"Institut Pertanian Bogor",19783019,,,,"English; Indonesian","Hayati J.
