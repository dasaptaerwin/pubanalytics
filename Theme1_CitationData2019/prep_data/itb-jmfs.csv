The LFO technique was built on the basis of the standard differential transform method (DTM). Illustrative examples used in demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method show that the solution method is very efficient and reliable as – unlike the variational iteration method – it does not depend on any process of identifying Lagrange multipliers, even while still maintaining accuracy. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Caputo derivative; Coupled burger equation; Exact solution; Fractional differential equations; Modified DTM,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

The cell is made by employing a lower grade (technical grade) of TiO2 as the active material. CuO powder is synthesized using a wet chemical method and mixed with TiO2 powder to give impurity to the TiO2. A layer of TiO2/CuO is then deposited onto fluorin-doped tin oxide (FTO) by spraying. Copper particles are grown on the spaces between the TiO2 and/or CuO particles by electroplating for more feasible electron migration. The TiO2/CuO/Cu solar cell is finalized by sandwiching a polymer electrolyte between the film and the counter electrode. Current-voltage measurement was performed for various parameters, such as the molarity of NaOH for producing CuO particles, the weight ratio of CuO over TiO2, and the current in the electroplating process.

HIF-1α (hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha), p53, and pRB were induced under hypoxia and correlated with cellular senescence. The localization and expression of HIF-1α, p53, and pRB in Chelonia mydas lung epithelial and dermal fibroblast cell cultures were analyzed under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (at 4 and 24 hours). Human dermal fibroblast was used for comparison purposes. Protein localization was analyzed with immunocytochemistry, while protein expression was analyzed with the Western blot and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method. HIF-1α, p53, and pRB were localized in the nuclei of the C. mydas cell cultures treated with hypoxia. The C. mydas lung epithelial cell cultures had a higher increase of HIF-1α expression than the human dermal fibroblast cell culture. The hypoxic conditions did not affect p53 expression significantly in C. mydas lung epithelial and dermal fibroblast cell cultures. Meanwhile, pRB expression changed significantly under hypoxia in the C. mydas dermal fibroblast cells. Expression of p53 and pRB in the human cell cultures was higher than in the C. mydas cell cultures.

In the long term, bioremediation is economic and feasible compared to other methods, such as physical or chemical methods. A bacterium that can efficiently reduce molybdenum blue was isolated from polluted soil. Biochemical analysis revealed the identity of the bacterium as Enterobacter sp. strain Saw-1. The growth parameters for optimal reduction of molybdenum to Mo-blue or molybdenum blue, a less toxic product, were determined around pH 6.0 to 6.5 and in the range of 30 to 37 °C, respectively. Glucose was selected as preferred carbon source, followed by sucrose, maltose, l-rhamnose, cellobiose, melibiose, raffinose, d-mannose, lactose, glycerol, d-adonitol, d-mannitol, l-arabinose and mucate. Phosphate and molybdate were critically required at 5.0 mM and 10 mM, respectively. The scanning absorption spectrum acquired to detect the development of complex Mo-blue showed similarity to previously isolated Mo-reducing bacteria. In addition, the spectrum closely resembled the molybdenum blue from the phosphate determination method. Heavy metals, including mercury, copper (II) and silver (I), inhibited reduction. Moreover, the bacterium also showed capability of exploiting the pesticide coumaphos as an alternative carbon source for growth. As the bacterium proved its ability to detoxify organic and inorganic xenobiotics, the usefulness of this microorganism for bioremediation is highlighted. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Bioremediation; Coumaphos; Enterobacter sp. strain Saw-1; Heavy metals; Molybdenum,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

There are two variations, i.e. the additive and the multiplicative method. Prior study by Vercher, et al. in [1] has shown that choosing the initial conditions is very important in exponential smoothing models, including the Holt-Winters method. Accurate estimates of initial conditions can result in better forecasting results. In this research, we propose new estimation rules for initial conditions for the Holt-Winters multiplicative method. The estimation rules were derived from the original initial conditions combined with the weighted moving average method. From the experimental results it was found that the new approach of the Holt-Winters multiplicative method can outperform the original Holt-Winters multiplicative method. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Estimation rules; Holt-Winters multiplicative method; Initial conditions; Time series analysis and forecasting; Weighted moving average,,"Hansun, S.; Computer Science Department, Universitas Multimedia Nusantara, Jl.

Through the correlation between temperature and surface gravity, it is concluded that the temperature of the inner horizon is always negative and that of the outer horizon is always positive. Since negative temperature is hotter than any positive temperature, it is predicted that particle radiation from the inner horizon will move toward the outer horizon. However, unlike temperature, entropy in both horizons remains positive. Following the definition of negative temperature in the inner horizon, it is assured that the entropy of a black hole within a closed system can never decrease. By analyzing the conditions of an extremal black hole, the third law of black hole thermodynamics can be extended to multi-horizon black holes. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Black hole radiation; Black hole thermodynamics; Entropy; Multi-horizon; Negative temperature,,"Tiandho, Y.; Department of Physics, Universitas Bangka Belitung, Kampus Terpadu UBB, Indonesia; email: yuant@ubb.ac.id",,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

The feasibility of using magnetic methods for monitoring pollution level is currently being tested in the river. Due to its location in a volcanic area, the sediments from the river are expected to be highly magnetic. In this study, sand and boulder samples from Balekambang, a relatively pristine upstream area of the river, were subjected to magnetic and geochemical characterizations to establish the baseline for unpolluted sediments. Such baseline is important for future magnetic monitoring of sediments in the river. The mass-specific magnetic susceptibility of boulder samples was found to be varied from 819.2 to 2340.5 × 10-8m3 kg-1 while that of sand samples varied from 2293.9 to 3845.3 × 10-8m3 kg-1. These high magnetic susceptibility values infer that river sediments are highly magnetic even before being contaminated by industrial and household wastes. The predominant magnetic mineral in sand samples was multi-domain magnetite while that in boulder samples was single to pseudo-single domain magnetite. These differences were supported by the results from petrographic and XRF analyses, implying that the sand and boulder samples originated from different geological formations. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Citarum River; Geochemistry; Magnetic method; Magnetic susceptibility; Volcanic area,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

However, the safe dosage of goat milk consumption has not been established previously. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safe dosage of caprine CSN1S2 protein from fresh local goat milk using acute and repeated doses (for 4 weeks) in oral toxicity studies on three month old normal Wistar rats. The CSN1S2 protein was isolated from fresh goat milk. This casein protein administered in a single oral gavage dose to 5 rat groups at a daily dose of 0, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 mg/kg BW for acute and 28-day sub-chronic toxicity testing of rats of both sexes. The result showed no evident mortality or abnormal effects. Data analysis of body weight, water and food intake, blood biochemical parameters, clinical observation and organ weight revealed no significant differences between all groups for both sexes. The weights of some organs showed differences between groups, but these values were within the normal weight ranges.

Some factors play a major role in angiogenesis, such as HIF-1α, and in metastasis, such as FAK and Wnt2. The aim of this study was to observe the effect of propolis and mangostin on the development of mammary gland cancer and on the expression of Wnt2 and FAK in Balb/C mice. Mammary gland tumors were induced in Balb/C mice by DMBA. The mice were divided into 5 treatment groups: negative control (K-); positive control treated with doxorubicin (14.04 mg/kg bw) (Dx); mice treated with propolis (0.32 mg/kg bw) (P) or mangostin (0.128 mg/kg bw) (M); and mice treated with a combination of propolis (0.32 mg/kg bw) and mangostin (0.128 mg/kg bw) (MP). Both mangostin and propolis did not affect the body weight of the mice. Treatment with propolis or treatment with propolis combined with mangostin was able to reduce tumor development activity in Balb/C mice. Moreover, the combination of mangostin and propolis was able to lower Wnt2, FAK and HIF- 1α expression. It can be concluded that the combination of propolis and mangostin has potential to inhibit cancer development through downregulation of Wnt2, FAK, and HIF1α expression. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Angiogenesis; Mammary cancer; Mangostin; Metastasis; Propolis,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

Microwave-assisted pretreatment is considered a green technology that can effectively break down lignocellulosic structures. The objective of this study was to investigate the most effective temperature for microwave-assisted oxalic acid pretreatment regarding the structural characteristic changes of oil palm empty fruit bunches (OPEFB) fibers. The fibers were subjected to microwave-assisted oxalic acid pretreatment at 160-200 °C with 2.5 minutes heating time and a liquid to solid ratio of 10. The effectiveness of the pretreatment was determined based on its delignification selectivity, morphological characteristics, and functional group changes. Microwave irradiation of OPEFB fibers at 180 ºC was effective in increasing the cellulose content by 24%. This pretreatment resulted in 1.82 delignification selectivity. More than 50% of the hemicellulose of the OPEFB was removed after this treatment, which was confirmed by a decrease of the absorption bands of functional groups at 1732 cm-1. The increase of pretreatment temperature disrupted the morphological structure of the OPEFB and removed its hemicellulose but did not change its functional groups and lignin content. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Changes of structural characteristics; Functional groups; Microwave-assisted oxalic acid pretreatment; Oil palm empty fruit bunches; Temperature,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

The equations arise from a microbial fermentation process in a metabolic system. The delay term appears due to the existence of a rate-limiting step in the fermentation pathway. We find that approximate solutions can be written as a linear combination of the Lambert function solutions in all branches. Simulations are presented for three cases of the ratio of the rate of glucose supply to the maximum reaction rate of the enzyme that experienced delay. The simulations are worked out by taking the principal branch of the matrix Lambert function as the most dominant mode. Our present numerical results show that the zeroth mode approach is quite reliable compared to the results given by classical numerical simulations using the Runge-Kutta method. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.,Cuckoo Search algorithm; Linearized delay differential system; Microbial fermentation process; The Lambert function; The zeroth mode,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

This study was conducted to examine the best medium and explants for regeneration of Phalaenopsis ‘Join Angle x Sogo Musadian’. In vitro and in vivo roots and leaves were used as explants, which were cultured in half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with various combinations of plant growth regulators (TDZ, 2,4-D, NAA, BAP and IAA). The results showed that the in vitro roots produced the highest number of PLBs (49.3 PLBs) when they were cultured in medium containing 0.5 ppm NAA, 5 ppm BAP, and 0.5 ppm IAA. The in vitro leaf explants also regenerated PLBs, however, only two PLBs developed, i.e. when they were cultured in medium containing 1 ppm TDZ and 2 ppm 2,4-D. PLB germination into plantlets was performed by culturing each PLB on MS medium without plant growth regulators.

The purpose of this research was to study the effect of vanadium dopant on the physicochemical properties of all materials obtained. Characterization of the prepared materials was carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and N2-adsorption-desorption analysis. The presence of Ti and O elements in M-TiO2 and of Ti, V and O elements in M-V doped TiO2 could be detected by SEM-EDS, while the patterns of X-ray diffraction of all the prepared samples had a well-crystalline surface of anatase type. All mesoporous vanadium-doped TiO2 (M-V-doped TiO2) materials performed in a highly transparent mode in the visible region at 554 nm (Eg= 2.24 eV) and 588 nm (Eg= 2.12 eV) for 3.3 and 4.9 wt% V doped TiO2, respectively. The Rietveld refinement method was applied to extract the structural parameters of the M-TiO2and M-V-doped TiO2 using the Fullprof program in the WinPlotr package. The prepared materials were refined in the crystal system and space group of anatase (tetragonal, I41/amd (141)). The vanadium ion was successfully doped into TiO2. The isotherm type of M-TiO2 and 2.3 wt% V doped TiO2were of type IV, with a profile of type H2 hysteresis loops, while the 3.3 and 4.9 wt% vanadium-doped TiO2 reflected isotherm type III. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) results showed a significant reduction in surface area due to increased concentrations of vanadium. The highest values of BET-specific surface area, pore volume and average pore size of M-TiO2 were 46 m2/g, 18.45 nm and 0.2572 cm3/g respectively. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Anatase; Hysteresis; Mesoporous materials; Reflux technique; Rietveld analysis,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

Stoichiometric quantities of analytical-grade MnCO3, BaCO3, Fe2O3, and SrCO3precursors with purity greater than 99% were mixed. It was found that the best phase composition, having an absorber with high performance, was Ba0.6Sr0.4Fe11MnO19. Refinement of the X-ray diffraction patterns revealed that the Ba0.6Sr0.4Fe11MnO19was single-phase and had a hexagonal structure (P63/mmc). Mechanical milling of Ba0.6Sr0.4Fe11MnO19powders produced particles with a mean size of ~850 nm. SEM images revealed the morphology of the particles as being aggregates of fine grains. The magnetic properties of the Ba0.6Sr0.4Fe11MnO19particles showed a low coercivity and a high remanent magnetization. The Ba0.6Sr0.4Fe11MnO19has certain microwave absorber properties in the frequency range of 8-14 GHz, with an absorbing peak value of -8 dB and -10 dB at frequencies of 8.5 and 12.5 GHz, respectively.

During normal conditions without IOD event, the first mode explains about 30-40% of the total variance in the western (60-65ºE) and central (75-80ºE) basin, while the second mode contributes up to 45% to the total variance in the central basin around the longitude of 82ºE. In contrast, during the 1997/98 IOD event, the fourth mode caused about 40% of the total variance in the central and eastern basin. During the 1994 IOD event, the contribution from the fourth baroclinic mode in the eastern basin caused 45% of the total variance. In the central basin, the second and the fourth baroclinic mode caused almost the same variance (~40%). The variations in the characteristics of the intraseasonal Kelvin waves are related to variations in the vertical stratification. During the IOD event, the pycnocline in the eastern basin was raised by about 50 m and the stratification at the upper level is strengthened, while it is weakened at lower levels. These changes lead to an increase in the contribution of higher-order baroclinic modes. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Indian Ocean Dipole; Interannual modulation; Intraseasonal Kelvin waves; Ocean general circulation model; Vertical baroclinic mode,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

The influence of various precursor compositions on the morphology of the ZnO nanorods, with substrate angles at 0° and 90°, was investigated. The various ratios of hexamethylenetetramine in zinc nitrate hexahydrate were used as precursors in the synthesis of ZnO. Scanning electron micrography indicated that the growth of the ZnO nanorods with a 0° substrate angle was smaller than with a 90° substrate angle. The substrate angle is defined as the angle between the plane of the substrate and the horizontal layer of an aqueous solution. When the precursor concentration of hexamethylenetetramine is not equal to the ratio corresponding to the chemical reaction, the effect of the substrate angle on the diameter size and morphology of the ZnO nanorods is evident. Grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) was used to characterize the structure of all samples.

The synthesis of zeolite ZSM-5 is usually carried out at a temperature above 100 °C using an immense amount of organic structuredirecting agents (OSDA). It is interesting to note that fine-tuning the initial gel mixture can be used to enhance the typical slow crystallization rate of ZSM-5. Herein, we report the effect of the surface-to-volume ratio of the reactor vessel on the crystallization of ZSM-5 at low temperature. The surface-to-volume ratio of the reactor vessel influences the heat-transfer during the synthesis, which further governs the crystallization of ZSM-5. It was found that the higher the surface-to-volume of the reactor, the more crystalline the resulting product. The products with the highest crystallinity exhibited a nearly spherical morphology composed of smaller ZSM-5 crystallites. This phenomenon allows the presence of inter-crystallite mesopores, which is an advantage for the catalytic reaction of bulky molecules. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Low OSDA; Low temperature; Mesopores; Surface-to-volume ratio; ZSM-5,,"Mukti, R.R.; Division of Inorganic and Physical Chemistry, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Jl.

We have investigated site response characteristics using the Horizontal-to-Vertical (H/V) Spectral Ratio method based on continuous ambient noise records from eight broadband seismometers. From the calculation results, generally, strong peaks were observed in the H/V spectral ratio curves caused by strong impedance contrast in this area. However, the BATU, LABU and DEHI sites showed relatively flat H/V spectral ratio curves caused by a lack of sharp impedance contrast beneath the site. Multiple peaks were observed at several sites, which may indicate the presence of a more highly weathered soil/clay layer on top of a more compact medium. H/V peak frequencies, which reveal the fundamental resonant frequencies of the soil sites, were generally observed in the range of 2.0 Hz-16.4 Hz. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Ambient noise; Amplification factor; Fundamental frequency; H/V spectral ratio; Simeulue Island; Site response,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

The aim of this study was to apply the multifractal technique to analyze the properties of five slices of peat soil (L1-L5). Binary images (220 x 220 pixels, with a conversion value of 9.41 μm/pixel) were made from the thin slices and then analyzed. This analysis was conducted to obtain the relationship between physical parameters and complexity parameters. The results showed that the spectrum of f(α) can describe well the pore size distribution and average size of pores correlated with the value of D(0). A high value of the average pore size is followed by a low D value and vice versa. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Complexity; Microscopic structure; Multifractal; Peat soil; Pore system,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

However, its low oral bioavailability limits the application of quercetin in therapy. Ester derivatives of quercetin have been reported to have higher bioavailability than quercetin. This research aimed to study the anti-inflammatory activities and gastric ulcer-inducing properties of tetraacetylquercetinas well as tetrapivaloylquercetin. Synthesis of tetra-acyl derivatives of quercetin was conducted using acetic anhydride or pivaloyl chloride in the presence of pyridine and the structure was confirmed by 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy as well as elemental analysis. At a dose of 20 mg/kg bw, oral administration of quercetin only showed 20% inhibition activity on carragenan induced rat paw edema, while tetraacetyl and tetrapivaloyl derivatives at equimolar dose showed 11-33% and 5-15% inhibition activity respectively. Contrary to the gastric ulcer healing-promoting action of quercetin, tetraacetylquercetin caused mild gastric ulcers. However, no gastric ulcer was observed after administration of tetrapivaloylquercetin. It was concluded that acylation enhances the anti-inflammatory activity of quercetin but causes mild gastric ulcers in the case of tetraacetylation. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Anti-inflammatory activity; Gastric ulcer-inducing property; Quercetin; Tetraacetylquercetin; Tetrapivaloylquercetin,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

The model is a host-vector model. We focussed on control of Avian influenza, where a vaccination is given to susceptible poultry, while medical treatment is given to infected humans. In the model, the human population is divided into four compartments: susceptible humans, infected humans, recovered humans, and treated humans. Meanwhile, the poultry population is divided into three compartments: susceptible poultry, infected poultry, and vaccinated poultry. To analyze the dynamical behavior of the model, we obtained the disease-free equilibrium, the endemic equilibrium, and the basic reproduction ratio. Furthermore, a model of the optimal vaccination and medical treatment schedule was constructed to know the optimal strategy for controlling Avian influenza. The model can be used to determine the minimal cost of controlling the disease. The model is solved by a genetic algorithm method. Numerical simulations showed that effective control of Avian influenza can be achieved with a combination of vaccination and medical treatment. Likewise, the optimal schedule and strategy for controlling Avian influenza are shown. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Genetic algorithm; Host-vector model; Medical treatment; Optimization; Vaccination,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

Taphonomic analysis of gastropod molluscs was used to interpret the cycle architecture of the Brown Shale (Pematang Group). Four types of shell concentrations were identified. The early transgressive deposit has a distinct erosion surface at the base, contains concretions, is formed of coarse-grained sediment with abraded and broken shells, and is interpreted as reworked deposits. The late transgressive deposit contains a hiatal concentration formed by continuing lake level rise, with many complete shells preserved in life position. The maximum transgressive deposit has complete shells in life position or that have been transported, as well as juvenile molluscs and broken shells. The early regressive deposit contains alternating shell-rich and shell-poor layers. Since the lacustrine system shows no tectonic effects and also no marine influenced indications, the seven sedimentary cycles identified in the Pesada Well are likely to have been affected by oscillations between monsoonal and dry periods. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Dry period; Lake; Molluscs; Monsoonal period; Pematang; Pesada; Sedimentary cycles; Taphonomy,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

However, a lack of continual and long time series in-situ SST data limited this study. To overcome this problem, the Sr/Ca composition in Porites coral taken from Outer Ambon Bay was used to reconstruct SST. The coral sample was sub-sampled monthly and analyzed using ICP-OES. Subsequently, the anchor point method was used to develop the chronology of the coral Sr/Ca based on ERSST v3b data. The regression equation results were Sr/Ca = -0.059 x SST + 10.32 (r = -0.699, n = 95, p < 0.05). The reconstructed SST based on these results was verified by in-situ data from May to November 2008. The difference was found to be 1.2-2.5 °C (σ = 0.05%). This results lead us to conclude that coral Sr/Ca reflects SST variation in Ambon Bay well. Based on the reconstructed SST, we found that the SST in Ambon Bay experiences an extreme seasonal variation, which is highly correlated to air temperature, wind speed, and length of sun radiation. Ambon Bay also experiences SST anomalies in some periods, which are dominantly affected by local atmospheric conditions rather than ENSO phenomena. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Ambon Bay; Coral Sr/Ca; Oceanography dynamics; Porites; Sea surface temperature reconstruction,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

It causes the solution process to halt. It is, therefore, important to deal with it to improve the resilience of the algorithms and increase their usability. In this paper, we consider restarting from a number of different approximate solutions that seem to be attractive starting points. They are: (a) the last iterate preceding breakdown, (b) the iterate with minimum residual norm found so far, and (c) the approximate solution whose entries are the median values of entries of all iterates generated by the Lanczos-type algorithm considered. Although it has been shown theoretically in the context of Arnoldi-type algorithms as well as Lanczos-type algorithms that restarting mitigates breakdown and allows the iterative process to continue and converge to good solutions, here we give an alternative theorem to that effect and a proof of it. However, emphasis is on the quality of the restarting points.

Anomalous ULF signals, possibly associated with the earthquake’s precursors, were determined by the Welch ratio SZ/SH at 0.06 Hz at the KTB station. These ULF anomalies were then compared with geomagnetic data observed from two reference stations in Darwin and Davao, to prevent misinterpretation of global geomagnetic disturbances as precursors. This study aims to analyze the relationship between earthquake magnitude and hypocenter radius, and seismic index against lead time during ULF-EM anomalies. We used the polarization ratio Welch method in terms of power spectrum density to evaluate the geomagnetic data by overlapping windows and applying fast Fourier transform (FFT). The results showed anomalous variations in onset and lead time, determined using the standard deviation controlling the SZ/SH power pattern.

The variable factors were type of board and type of resin. Two different types of board with a target density of 0.8 g/cm3 were manufactured. The boards were prepared in three layers of about 1:1:1 weight ratio in crossoriented and unidirectional pattern, using low molecular weight (LM) phenol formaldehyde (PF) resin type PL-3725 and high molecular weight (HM) PF resin type PL-2818 for impregnation and adhesive purposes. Decay resistance (white and brown rot fungi) of the MDF was evaluated to assess its biological performance. In this study, fiber orientation had no effect on the decay resistance to white and brown rot fungi of the specimens. However, a slight increase was found for the mass loss of the low molecular weight PF resin board specimens compared with the mixed low and high molecular PF resin board specimens.

Bamboo strandboards with nominal dimensions of 37 mm by 37 mm by 12 mm and target density 0.65 g/cm3 were manufactured using moso bamboo (Pyllostachys pubescent Mezel) and MDI resin to produce two types of strandlength. Two types of strand length and MDI resin were used to produce three types of strandboard. The bending properties and dimensional stability of the strandboards were evaluated according to the Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) for particleboard. The results of this experiment indicate that the bending properties and internal bond strength were affected by both board type and strand-length. The distribution of resin inside the 80 mm strandboard was less homogenous than in the 50 mm strandboard, which affects the internal bond strength. Thickness swelling of the RAND board was the highest and linear stability was affected substantially by strand alignment. The RAND board and cross-oriented 3LAY board effectively restrained linear expansion in the direction perpendicular to the strand alignment. A cross-oriented core may be the most effective way to reduce dimensional change and bending property values in perpendicular directions. © 2015, Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Bamboo; Bending properties; Board type; Dimensional stability long strand; Strandboard,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

It is sourced from the musyarakah method in Islamic Syariah law and implemented for small-scale investments of traditional-market traders. They are the common target of usurers, so they may end up poorer than they were before. The main goal of the model is to find the appropriate portion of profit share, so the investment is profitable not only for the investor but also for the trader. There are three main problems in the process of formulating the mathematical model and finding optimized results. The first problem is providing the appropriate amount of data to be implemented in the model. The second problem is determining the objective function for the optimization of the portion of profit share.

The local approach of a non-linear inverse problem has fundamental limitations, i.e. the necessity of a starting model close to the solution and possible convergence to a local rather than a global minimum solution. We studied the application of a global search approach for non-linear inversion using the guided random search method to model VES data. A quasi-2D resistivity model can be created by stitching 1D models obtained from VES data along a profile. Both vertical and lateral resistivity variations are minimized to incorporate a 2D smoothness constraint. The proposed method was applied to invert synthetic VES data as well as field data from a sedimentary environment. Both synthetic and field data inversions resulted in models that correlated well with the known synthetic model and with the geology of the study area, respectively. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",2D model; DC resistivity; Global search; Monte Carlo method; Non-linear inversion,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

The samples were investigated for their physical and radiation shielding properties. The density and hardness were measured. The results showed that the density increased with the increase of Bi2O3 content. The highest value of hardness was observed for glass sample with 30 wt% of Bi2O3 concentration. The samples were investigated under 662 keV gamma ray and the results were compared with theoretical calculations. The values of the mass attenuation coefficient (μm), the atomic cross section (σe) and the effective atomic number (Zeff) were found to increase with an increase of the Bi2O3 concentration and were in good agreement with the theoretical calculations. The best results for the half-value layer (HVL) were observed in the sample with 35 wt% of Bi2O3 concentration, better than the values of barite concrete.

Herein, alginate molecules acted as both a reducing and stabilizing agent for the preparation of the silver nanoparticles. The obtained nanoparticles were characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, particle size analysis (PSA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The pH and concentration ratio of the alginate/metal precursor salt greatly influenced the particle size and its distribution of Ag-NP. The higher the pH the higher the nucleation rate and the larger the electrostatic stabilization, while both of them were responsible for producing a smaller particle size and a narrower size distribution. A higher concentration ratio also yielded a smaller particle size and a narrower size distribution, but above the optimum ratio, the trend was conversely changed due to the reducing capability of the alginate, which was dominant above the optimum ratio, thus creating a high density of nuclei, allowing aggregation to occur. A lower ratio not only led to a higher tendency to produce larger particles, but also a higher probability of anisotropic particle shape formation due to the lack of reducing capability of the alginates. © 2015, Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Alginate; Microwave irradiation; Particle size; Reducing and stabilizing agent; Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs),,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

The results show that the sticker sensor can be used to determine the degree of beef freshness, since the color change of the litmus paper and the quality degradation of the beef during storage time had a similar trend, where the decay of the beef could be detected clearly (when the red litmus paper changed to blue). The sticker sensor reacted accurately to the beef’s freshness in terms of pH change due to beef deterioration from pH 5.61 to 6.24 and from pH 5.67 to 6.02 as shown by its color change in real time at room and chiller temperature respectively. Thus, the sticker sensor can be used as an effective tool for monitoring the microbial quality of packaged fresh meat that correlates with the increased pH of the beef, where the total viable count (TVC) of 5 x 106 cfu/g or 6.698 log cfu/g correlates with a pH of 6.24.

Therefore, we report on the development of a new breakthrough technique for the production of double seedlings from a single embryo. The technique consists of four steps, viz. (i) germination; (ii) incision; (iii) splitting; and (iv) recovery. A histological study was carried out on the development of the halved embryo into a new shoot. The best recovery process was obtained when the incised embryo was split into two and recovered into Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 2 μM IBA and 15 μM kinetin. Following this protocol, an average of 56 shoots was successfully recovered from 30 zygotic embryos. The histological study also revealed that the meristem tissue of the halved embryo was able to produce a new meristem and primordial leaf. Most of the shoots then went on to produce normal seedlings and could be acclimatized successfully after having developed 2 or 3 leaves. This protocol is useful for routine seedling production of the kopyor-type coconut. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Embryo culture; Embryo splitting; In vitro culture; Meristem; Multiplication,,"Sisunandar; Biology Education Department, University of Muhammadiyah Purwokerto, Jl.

Apart from H1 receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine (AChM) receptors are also involved in the mechanism of ileum contraction. Marmin is predicted to antagonize the AChM3 receptors. This study was aimed at determining the effect of marmin on smooth muscle contraction of isolated guinea pig ileum induced by metacholine, an AChM3 agonist. The methods used were in vitro (isolated organ) and in silico (docking PLANTS) studies. In the in vitro study, marmin exhibited a competitive antagonistic effect at a concentration of 100 μM (pA2 = 1,728) on the AChM3 receptors. A reversibility assay of the AChM3 receptors showed that by washing the ileum with Tyrode’s buffer every 6 minutes for 30 minutes, the bond of marmin to the receptors was still not completely detached. In the in silico study, marmin was observed to be bound to the AchM3 receptors (docking score: -102.086). The marmin bond was weaker than that of the native ligand of the AChM3 receptors (tiotropium, docking score: -115.107), but stronger than that of the AChM3 receptor agonist and antagonist. Based on the results, we conclude that marmin has competitive antagonist activity on AChM3 receptors.

The aim of this research was to stimulate biogenic methane formation using simple carbon as stimulant. The microcosm set-up was done using subbituminous coal at 37°C in an anaerobic chamber. Stimulation with Na- acetate, methanol, formic acid, and no additions, respectively, was carried out for 54 days; observation took place on day 2, 15, 24, 45, and54. The results of all treatments showed differences in the initial pH of the basal medium: 7.76 (Na- acetate), 6.69 (methanol), 4.06 (formic acid), and 8.95 (no stimultant), respectively. Addition of Na-acetate resulted in the highest methane formation rate (5.034 mmol/g coal on day 24 of incubation), followed by methanol (4.377 mmol/g on day 24 of incubation), formic acid (2.520 mmol/g on day 22 of incubation), and no addition (1.2 mmol/g on day 15 of incubation). Using denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) it was observed that the microbial population dynamics of the microcosm depended on the stimulant. A decrease of bands indicated that the addition of Na-acetate and methanol had caused a decrease of bacterial diversity during the stimulation process compared to the control treatment (without stimulant). © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Coal bed methane; Denatured gradient gel electrophoresis; Methanogenesis; Stimulation; Volatile fatty acids,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

Ethylene production generally increases in response to pathogen attacks and other environmental stress conditions. The synthesis of this phytohormone is regulated by two enzymes, ACC synthase (ACS) and ACC oxidase (ACO). ACC synthase is encoded by a multigene that regulates the production of ACC, after which this precursor is converted into ethylene by ACO. Pisang Ambon (Musa sp. AAA group), a banana cultivar originating from Indonesia, has nine ACS genes (MaACS 1-9) and one ACO gene (MaACO). One of the banana ACS genes, MaACS2, is stress-inducible. In this research, we have investigated the expression profile of MaACS2 in the roots and leaf tissues of infected tissue culture plants. Quantification of gene expression was analyzed using Real-Time PCR (qPCR) using Ma18srRNA and MaGAPDH as reference genes. The results showed nine-to ten fold higher MaACS2 expression levels in the infected roots tissues compared to the uninfected roots tissues.

Recalcitrance to saccharification is a major limitation for conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol. The biological process for converting lignocellulose to fuel ethanol includes delignification in order to liberate cellulose and hemicelluloses, depolymerization of carbohydrate polymers to produce free sugars, and sugar fermentation to produce ethanol. Access of plant cell wall polysaccharides to chemical, enzymatic and microbial digestion is limited by many factors, including the presence of lignin and hemicellulose that cover cellulose microfibrils. An effort to support the fuel ethanol fermentation industry using the Indonesian woody plant species Shorea uliginosa Foxw. was undertaken with regard to the established efficient bioethanol production process. This paper relates to a method for producing bioethanol from the lignocellulose of S. uliginosa Foxw. by saccharification and fermentation of xylem. A literature study of previous research on cellulose hydrolysis as a method for producing bioethanol was necessary. The objective of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of the degradation mechanisms of cellulose by enzymes through a study of previous research, which were then compared to the new method. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Enzymatic hydrolysis; Ethanol; Lignocelluloses; S. uliginosa Foxw; Xylem,,"Dwianto, W.; Research Center for Biomaterials, Indonesian Institute of Sciences, Jalan Raya Bogor km 46, Indonesia",,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

The inverse problem is formulated as a minimization of the moment of inertia of the causative body with respect to the axes of the mass concentration.

This result does not change when there is an extra Hamiltonian term. We have also applied these two scenarios in AQC to a Hadamard gate. Adding an extra Hamiltonian gives a non-trivial result compared to the normal AQC, however it does not result in a speed-up.

This study looked into related data from 2005-2010 covering eight principal parameters: PM10 (particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 10 micrometer), CO (carbon monoxide), NO<inf>2</inf> (nitrogen dioxide), SO<inf>2</inf> (sulphur dioxide), RH (relative humidity), NO (nitrogen oxide), pressure, and rainfall. Overall haze problem occurrence was calculated from a logistic regression model. Its dependence on the eight parameters stated above was determined for design conditions using the correlation coefficients with PM10. The proposed overall haze problem modeling can be used as a quantitative assessment criterion for supporting decision making to protect human health.

This process comprises mixed culture microbial activities on the cocoa bean pulp, producing metabolites that act as important precursors for cocoa flavour development. Variations in the microbial population dynamics during the fermentation process may induce changes in the overall process. Thus, the introduction of a specific microbial starter culture may improve the quality of the fermentation. This article discusses the effects of the addition of Saccharomyces cerevisae var. Chevalieri starter culture on cocoa bean fermentation. The dynamics in the yeast concentration, sugary pulp compounds and metabolic products were measured during fermentation. The alterations in the dynamic metabolite profile were significant, although only a slight difference was observed in the yeast population. A higher fermentation index was measured for the cocoa bean fermentation with yeast starter culture, 1.13 compared to 0.84. In conclusion, this method can potentially be applied to shorten the cocoa bean fermentation time. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Cocoa bean; Fermentation; Pulp degradation; Starter; Yeast,,"Penia Kresnowati, M.

However, biocompatibility and safety aspects of this material have not been reported yet. We have evaluated the mutagenicity of the raw material and the sterility of processed material of Indonesian coral Goniopora sp. as a potential candidate for osteogenic bone graft. In addition, heavy metals were also identified and determined. A mutagenicity test was conducted using the Ames test, while a sterility test was carried out based on the direct inoculation method. The heavy metals tested - including arsenic, lead, cadmium, chrome, cobalt, silver, and mercury - were analyzed by neutron activation analysis or atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The results showed that the Indonesian coral did not display mutagenic properties and proved sterile after irradiation. Arsenic, lead, cadmium, mercury, chrome, cobalt, and silver were identified at a concentration level of < 2.65, <3.60, 25.23, 1.72, 34.67, 0.51, and 44.01 ppm, respectively. Taking into account arsenic, lead, cadmium and mercury contents and their provisional tolerable daily intake (PTDI) values, the maximum daily safe exposure level of Indonesian coral Goniopora sp. was predicted to be 1 g/person. It was concluded that the coral can be developed as a potential osteogenic bone graft. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Biocompatibility; Bone graft; Coral; Goniopora sp.; Heavy metals; Mutagenicity; Sterility,,"Kartasasmita, R.

The spread of WNV in chicken populations is quite unique. Although chickens can contract the virus through a mosquito bite, they immediately build immunity to the virus and do not show physical symptoms of illness and hence chickens are only temporary carriers of the virus. Recently, experimental results have shown that mosquitoes do not change fecundity behavior, yet results indicate that resistance to infection is associated with a fitness cost in terms of mosquito survival. We constructed a host-vector type transmission model for WNV in mosquito-chicken populations. The basic reproductive ratio, R<inf>0</inf>, was obtained. From sensitivity analysis of R<inf>0</inf> it was shown that under certain conditions this ratio decrease – with an increase of the lifetime of mosquito infection. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Basic reproductive ratio; Dynamical model; Mosquito-chicken interaction; Stability analysis; WNV transmission,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

The aim of this research was to improve microwave-assisted hydrolysis of cassava pulp by using oxalic acid as a catalyst. Suspension of cassava pulp in 0.5% oxalic acid (1 g/20 mL) was subjected to microwave irradiation at 140-230°C for 5 minutes, with 4 minutes of pre-heating. One gram of fractured activated carbon made of coconut shell was added into a number of suspensions that were subjected to the same conditions of microwave irradiation. The soluble fraction of the hydrolysates was analyzed for its total soluble solids, malto-oligomer distribution, glucose content, pH value, and formation of brown compounds. The effects of the combined severity parameter at a substrate concentration of 5-12.5% on the glucose yield were also evaluated. The highest glucose yield (78% of dry matter) was obtained after hydrolysis at 180°C without activated carbon addition. Heating above 180°C reduced the glucose yield and increased the pH and the formation of brown compounds. The use of activated carbon in microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis of cassava pulp reduced the glucose yield, but suppressed the formation of brown compounds. The highest glucose yield (70-80% of dry matter) was attained at a severity parameter of 1.3-1.5. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Activated carbon; Cassava pulp; Glucose; Hydrolysis; Microwave; Oxalic acid; Severity parameter,,"Hermiati, E.; RandD Unit for Biomaterials, Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI), Jalan Raya Bogor Km 46, Indonesia",,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

Unlike the original convective stratiform technique (CST), which only utilizes infrared (IR) data, CSTm applies not only IR data but also passive microwave (PMW) data. Two major modifications contained in CSTm are: (1) the application of a variability index (VI) method that uses PMW data to perform convective and stratiform separation, and (2) the ability to determine the average extensive coverage of the new areas of each pixel point as a result of the utilization of the PMW data. In this study, rainfall estimation was conducted for 23 points spread over four major islands in Indonesia. The estimation was performed based only on IR and PMW data obtained from coincident observations. For verification, the estimation results were compared with real observations. The main verification action conducted in this study used multi-category contingency tables for 4 categories and this action was supported by the root mean square error (RMSE) method. The verification results of the hourly estimation conducted for 4 days in early November 2011 showed that CSTm can effectively improve the performance quality of CST. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Cst; Cstm; Infrared; Passive microwave; Rainfall estimation,,"Endarwin; Faculty of Earth Sciences and Technology, Institute Technology of Bandung, Jalan Ganesa No. 10, Indonesia",,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

However, the available information concerning the subsurface model and bedrock depth is insufficient for a seismic hazard analysis. In this study, a microtremor array method was applied to estimate the geometry and S-wave velocity of the sedimentary layer. The spatial autocorrelation (SPAC) method was applied to estimate the dispersion curve, while the S-wave velocity was estimated using a genetic algorithm approach. The analysis of the 1D and 2D S-wave velocity profiles shows that along a north-south line, the sedimentary layer is thicker towards the north. It has a positive correlation with a geological cross section derived from a borehole down to a depth of about 300 m. The SPT data from the BMKG site were used to verify the 1D S-wave velocity profile. They show a good agreement. The microtremor analysis reached the engineering bedrock in a range from 359 to 608 m as depicted by a cross section in the north-south direction. The site class was also estimated at each site, based on the average S-wave velocity until 30 m depth.

These internal labor regulations are in general more restrictive at Garuda Indonesia than at other airlines, so that modeling the cockpit crew rostering problem for Garuda Indonesia is challenging. We have derived mathematical expressions for the cockpit crew labor regulations and some technical matters. We model a non-linear integer programming for the rostering problem, using the average relative deviation of total flight time to the ideal flight time as the objective function. The optimization model have been tested for all classes of cockpit crews of Garuda Indonesia, using a simulated annealing method for solving the problem. We obtained satisfactory rosters for all crew members in a short amount of computing time. This shows that the optimization problem is well-defined. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Crew labor regulation; Crew pairing; Crew rostering; Crew scheduling; Optimization; Simulated annealing,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

This research was conducted in order to evaluate: the potential of different types of explants to produce somatic embryos; combinations of 2,4-D and BAP for somatic embryo induction; and the ability of BAP to act as growth regulator for the somatic embryo maturation process. Young leaf and stem nodal sections were cultured in MS media supplemented with 2,4-D and BAP. The developing calli were then transferred into media containing several concentrations of 2,4-D and BAP. The embryogenic calli were then transferred into media containing 1-5 μM BAP. The results show that MS media containing 2,5 μM 2,4-D + 5 μM BAP and μM 2,4-D + 0.5 μM BAP were the most suitable for inducing somatic embryos from leaf explants and stem nodal section explants, respectively. The somatic embryos were well-developed in the MS media supplemented with 5 μM BAP. The stem nodal section explants were able to produce a higher percentage of globular, heart and torpedo stage embryos compared with the leaf explants.

The first borehole was 39 meters deep while the second was 19 meters deep. The aim of the study was to determine the subsurface velocity and Q-factor for the region between the two boreholes for geotechnical purposes. Sources of seismic waves were produced by an impulse generator and sparker and were recorded by 12 channels of borehole hydrophones. In the tomography inversion, the pseudo-bending ray tracing method was employed to calculate travel times. The initial velocity model was a 1-D model with 1x1 m2 block dimensions. The non-linear inversion problem was solved by delay-time tomography with the LSQR method. Also, a checkerboard resolution test (CRT) was conducted to evaluate the resolution of the tomography inversion. Using the velocity structure results, a LSQR Q-tomography inversion was carried out using spectral curve fitting to obtain the attenuation structure (t* values). The resulting tomogram shows that there are 3 layers, with an unconsolidated layer (down to 8 meters), a consolidated layer (from 8 meters deep to 20 meters), and bedrock (more than 20 meters).

Block parameterization is not suitable, because it is not capable of representing the velocity model well. A large amount of blocks with a small grid size are needed to express the model well, but in that case, a ray coverage problem will be encountered. A knot-point parameterization model is better suited than a block model, because it can express the velocity model well, while the number of variables is much smaller. Ray calculation using the pseudo-bending method is not appropriate for the velocity model because of an instability problem at high velocity gradients. The crucial problem of this method involves the initial ray-path that is optimized in order to obtain the ""true"" ray, but does not satisfy the Fermat principle. These problems can be solved by applying the eikonal-solver method, because this can handle high-velocity gradients and does not need an initial ray path. Using a suitable model parameterization and appropriate ray tracing method, the inversion can obtain good results that fit the desired output. Applying a block model and the pseudo-bending method will not produce the desired output. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Eikonal-solver method; Fermat principle; Knot-point parameterization; Low velocity structure; Pseudo-bending method,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

The rapid heat and cooling process introduced a non-equilibrium condition causing changes in the microstructure as well as the chemical composition of the alloyed aluminum surface.

The model also provides an unbiased way of scheduling the nurses and thus leads to an overall higher satisfaction and fairness to the nurses and the hospital management. © 2011 Published by LPPM ITB.",Cyclical scheduling; Goal programming; Nurse scheduling,,"Jenal, R.; School of Information Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan MalaysiaMalaysia; email: ruzza@ftsm.ukm.my",,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375760,,,,English,J.

A Q-switched Nd:YAg laser was focused to induce breakdown and plasma formation. The high plasma temperature and the shock wave pressure were responsible for speeding up the laser surface alloying process. The rapid heat and cooling process introduced a non-equilibrium condition causing changes in the microstructure as well as the chemical composition of the alloyed aluminum surface. The remelted layer and molten pools were realized after the aluminum received a power density greater than 5 x 108 Wcm-2.

Dual modification of arrowroot starch using hydroxypropylation and cross-linking was carried out to overcome the lack of native arrowroot starch in food processing application. The modifications applied were: combined propylene oxide (8%, 10%, and 12%); sodium tri meta phosphate/STMP (1%, 2%, and 3%); and sodium tri poly phosphate/STPP (4%, 5%, and 6%). These modifications significantly affected the composition of the amylose and amylopectin and the amount of phosphorus in the granules. Higher amounts of phosphate salt gave a higher phosphorus content, which increased the degree of substitution (DS) and the degree of cross-link. Arrowroot starch that was modified using a concentration of 8-10% propylene oxide and 1-2% STMP: 3-5% STPP produced a starch with < 0.4% phosphorus content. A higher concentration of propylene oxide provided a higher degree of hydroxypropyl. The changed physical properties of the modified granular arrowroot starch were examined through SEM testing, and its changed crystalline patterns through X-ray diffraction measurements.

The aim of this research was to perform a numerical simulation using a nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) to obtain the compression strength of the Red Meranti (shorea spp.) timber species at an angle to the grain ranging from 12° to 80°. The material properties needed for the analysis were obtained from clear specimen tests. To investigate the validity of the numerical results, various cross grain specimens were tested under uniaxial compressive stress. It has been shown in this study that an FEA based on the distortion energy of an orthotropic material can be used to obtain the compressive strength at proportional limit for cross grain specimens. Comparison with the experimental results showed that for a cross grain angle between 12° and 80° the FEA predicted the strength to be 9.4% to 33.6% lower than the experimental results. Compared to using Hankinson's formula to predict the compressive strength at a cross grain angle, using the FEA always gave a lower value, ranging from 13.2% to 30.5%. Based on these results, an FEA incorporating Hill's yield criterion is a conservative method for predicting compressive strength at an angle to the grain. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Compression; FEA; Grain angle; Hill's yield criterion; Red meranti,Compaction; Finite element method; Compression strength; Grain angles; Non-linear finite element model; Nonlinear finite element analyses (FEA); Orthotropic materials; Red meranti; Uniaxial compressive; Yield criteria; Compressive strength,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",19783051,,,,English,ITB J.

The instrument was developed through buffer stock scheme in accordance with warehouse receipt system (WRS) and collateral management system. The public service institution for staple food buffer stock (BLUPP) is proposed as wholesaler's competitor with main responsibility to ensure price stabilization and availability of staple food. Multi criteria decision making is formulated as single objective a mixed integer non linear programming (MINLP). The result shows that the proposed model can be applied to solve the distribution problem and can give more promising outcome than its counterpart, the direct market intervention instrument. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.",BLUPP; Buffer stocks; Indirect market intervention; MINLP; Price stabilization; Staple food availability; Warehouse receipt system,BLUPP; Buffer stock; Indirect market intervention; MINLP; Price stabilization; Staple food; Instruments; International trade; Stabilization; Warehouses; Costs,"Sutopo, W.; Department of Industrial Engineering, Sebelas Maret University, Surakarta 57126, Indonesia; email: sutopo@uns.ac.id",,,19783051,,,,English,ITB J.

White rot fungi used were Marasmius sp, Trametes hirsuta, Trametes versicolor and Phanerochaete crysosporium. The solid substrates employed in this research were collected from agriculture waste which were empty fruit bunches (EFB), rice straw, corn cob, and rice husk. The objective of this research was to determine the most promising fungus, the best solid substrate and the optimal conditions for the production of laccase. The results showed that Marasmius sp. on all solid substrates displayed higher laccase activity than that of any other strain of white rot fungi. Marasmius sp. and solid substrate of rice straw demonstrated the highest laccase activity of 1116.11 U/L on day 10. Three significant factors, i.e. pH, temperature and yeast extract concentration were studied by response surface method on laccase production using Marasmius sp and rice straw. The optimized conditions were pH, temperature and yeast extract concentration of 4.9, 31oC and 0.36 g/L respectively.

The conventional technique employs a manual trial and error process to find new well locations, which proves to be time-consuming, especially, for a large field. Concerning this practical matter, an alternative in the form of a robust technique was introduced in order that time and efforts could be reduced in finding best new well locations capable of producing the highest oil recovery. The objective of the research was to apply Genetic Algorithm (GA) in determining wells locations using reservoir simulation to avoid the manual conventional trial and error method. GA involved the basic rock properties, i.e., porosity, permeability, and oil saturation, of each grid block obtained from a reservoir simulation model, which was applied into a newly generated fitness function formulated through translating the common engineering practice in the reservoir simulation into a mathematical equation and then into a computer program. The maximum of the fitness value indicated a final searching of the best grid location for a new well location. In order to evaluate the performance of the generated GA program, two fields that had different production profile characteristics, namely the X and Y fields, were applied to validate the proposed method. The proposed GA method proved to be a robust and accurate method to find the best new well locations for field development. The key success of this proposed GA method is in the formulation of the objective function. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.",Field development; Fitness function; Genetic Algorithm; Objective function; Optimization; Reservoir simulation; Vertical well placement; Well locations,Field development; Fitness functions; Objective functions; Reservoir simulation; Vertical wells; Well location; Computer simulation; Functions; Health; Oil field development; Optimization; Petroleum prospecting; Petroleum reservoirs; Wells; Genetic algorithms,"Ariadji, T.; Department of Petroleum Engineering, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung 40132, Indonesia; email: tutukaariadji@tm.itb.ac.id",,,19783051,,,,English,ITB J.

A maximum horizontal displacement of 2.11 m was observed at PRKB station, while the vertical component at BSAT station was uplifted with a maximum of 0.73 m, and the vertical component at LAIS station was subsided by -0.97 m. The method of adding more constraint on the inversion for the Bengkulu earthquake slip distribution from GPS observations can help solve a least squares inversion with an under-determined condition.

The service robot in this research is programmed to deliver a drinking cup to the recognized customer from a specified starting point. We have developed three main modules: one for face recognition, one to identify obstacles, and one to maneuver. The detection of static obstacles, which is based on information from the landmark, uses an edge-detection method and is used to generate a planned path. The speed, direction and distance of the moving obstacle are measured by using vision and distance sensors in order for the robot to make a maneuver. Algorithms for obstacle avoidance for service robots are proposed and a new geometrical model is introduced for service robots to make a good avoidance maneuver. The main aim of this research is to provide a complete mechanism for obstacle avoidance by a vision-based service robot, whereas popular obstacle avoidance methods such as PVM do not provide such a feature.

It was demonstrated that the phase-boundary catalyst system required neither stirring to make an emulsion, nor addition of a cosolvent to make a homogeneous solution to drive the reaction. However, some basic facts about them remain unclear, such as the question as to where an effective location of the active sites of PBC resides: is it on the external surface of the catalysts, or in their pores? In order to elucidate this problem, TS-1, HZSM-5 and zeolite loaded with alkylsilane-covered sulfonic acid in which the location of the active sites is mainly inside the pore system, were chosen as model catalysts. Catalytic activities of the catalysts TS-1 and HZSM-5 were examined after modification with n-octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODS). Their activities were compared with zeolite loaded with alkylsilane-covered titanium oxide particles, in which the active sites are on the external surface in reactions of 1-octene with aqueous H2O2 and cyclohexene with water as model reactions.

This molecule has been studied for many years from different points of interest with both experimental and theoretical methods. In this study, the Restricted Hartree-Fock /Configuration Interaction Single (RHF/CIS), Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT), and several semi-empirical methods (CNDO/S and ZINDO) calculations were carried out to reconstruct the UV-Vis absorption spectra of chlorophyll a. To some extent, the calculation results based on the single-molecule approach succeeded to reconstruct the absorption spectra, but they required to be rescaled to fit the experimental results. In general, the semi-empirical methods provide a better energy scaling factor. However, they lack vertical transition fine features with respect to the spectrum obtained experimentally. In this case, the ab initio calculations provided more complete features, especially the TDDFT with high-level basis sets, which also has a good accuracy with regards to the transition energies. The contribution of the ground state and excited state orbitals in the main vertical transitions is discussed based on the delocalized nature of the wave functions and the presence of solvents using the polarizable continuum model (PCM). © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.",Chlorophyll a; CIS; CNDO/S; Electronic transition; TDDFT; UV-Vis absorption spectra; ZINDO,,"Suendo, V.; Inorganic and Physical Chemistry Research Division, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Jalan Ganesha 10, Bandung, Jawa Barat 40132, Indonesia; email: vsuendo@chem.itb.ac.id",,,19783043,,,,English,ITB J.

The transfer of oxygen from blood to tissue takes place in capillaries through a diffusion process. The capillary-tissue region is usually represented by the so-called Krogh cylinder model, in which the distribution of the oxygen concentration in a tissue region leads to a diffusion equation with oxygen consumption rates following the Michaelis-Menten kinetics. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to the steady state case and solve the equation analytically by means of asymptotic expansion for a particular limit of the oxygen consumption rate. Results show that there exists a critical ratio between supply and consumption of oxygen in the tissue region in order to fulfill the cell's oxygen requirements. Above from this critical ratio, we also found a critical distance in the tissue region above which the oxygen concentration vanishes.

The misfit structure was revealed from refinement of the XRD data, with reduction of the lattice parameters while increasing the Y doping content. Compared with the (Bi,Pb)2Sr2Co2O8 parent compound system, the lattice parameter c was reduced significantly, while the misfit degree remained almost the same. The analysis of the magnetic data shows that the Cobalt ions are coupled antiferromagnetically within the CoO2 layers, with the existence of mixed valence states between Co3+ and Co4+ ions. Besides that, the effective magnetic moments of Cobalt ions are almost constant along the Y doping content. Assuming the orbital quenching as commonly found in most transition metal ions, the data are best fitted by taking the low-spin state of Co3+ ions and intermediate spin state of Co4+ ions. We argue qualitatively, that the spin-state transition across the gap are induced by the shrinkage of the charge transfer energy gaps between O 2p and Co eg levels due to reduction of the ionic spaces between Co and O ions. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.",Antiferromagnetic; Mixed valence states; Spin state; Thermoelectric materials,,"Sutjahja, I.

The observations indicate the presence of upwelling equatorial waves and westward near-surface zonal currents along the equator during the activation phase of the event in August 2006. These upwelling equatorial waves (negative sea surface height anomalies) and westward zonal current anomalies contributed to significant sea surface cooling in the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean. The model results reveal that the upwelling equatorial waves and westward near-surface zonal currents were mainly generated by wind-forced Kelvin waves associated with the easterly wind anomalies. On the other hand, anomalous easterly winds along the equator during June caused downwelling waves (positive sea surface height anomalies) in the off-equatorial region which propagated westward and elevated sea levels in the western region. The model further shows that a complex interplay of wind-forced and boundary-generated Rossby waves elevated sea levels in the western equatorial Indian Ocean during the activations phase of the 2006 IOD event. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.",Indian Ocean Dipole; Kelvin waves; Rossby waves; Sea surface height; Zonal current,,"Iskandar, I.; Fakultas MIPA, Universitas Sriwijaya Kampus Inderalaya, Jln.

In this study, the process is assumed to be a one-dimensional pseudohomogeneous model and takes place with a certain reaction rate in which thewhole process ofthereactor is still workable. Thus, the reaction rate can proceed at a fixed temperature. Under these conditions, we can restrict ourselves to solving the equations for the conversion only. From the available data, it turns out that the ratio of the diffusion term to the reaction term is small. Hence, this ratio is considered as a small parameter in our model and this leads to a singular perturbation problem. Numerical difficulties will be found in the vicinity of a small parameter in front of a higher order term. Here, we present an analytical solutionby means of matched asymptotic expansions.

Mixing was carried out using urea powder and natural zeolite powder (UZ) of three varying particle sizes (50- 60, 60-80 and 80 mesh). Power consumption was calculated from the measured torque of orbit and screw, obtained from computerized records. It was found that the mixing process in the modified orbiting screw mixer with air injection required a lower power consumption for each particle-size group when compared to mixing without air injection. With UZ mixing in MOSM with air injection, the lowest E was obtained for the 60-80 mesh particle-size group (4,297 Joule/kg-1), whereas when mixing without air injection, the value was 10,296 J/kg. The best mixing operation in this experiment was achieved at NFr = 1.18x10-3 and in the range of values NRe ≈ 8.77x107 to 2.63x108.

Square-confined concrete columns without longitudinal reinforcement were designed, and tested under concentric axial compression. The columns were made of concrete with a compressive strength ranging between 30 MPa and 70 MPa. The test parameters in the study are concrete compressive strengths and confining steel properties, i.e. spacing, volumetric ratios and configurations. The effects of these parameters on the strength and ductility of square-confined concrete were evaluated. Of the specimens tested in this study, the columns made with higher-strength concrete produced less strength enhancement and ductility than those with lower-strength concrete. The steel configurations were found to have an important role in governing the strength and ductility of the confined high-strength concrete.

However, installation of a confining reinforcement with a 135-degree hook is not easy. Therefore, in practice, many construction workers apply a confining reinforcement with a 90- degreehook (non-code compliant). Based on research and records of recent earthquakes in Indonesia, the use of a non-code compliant confining reinforcement for concrete columns produces structures with poor seismic performance. This paper presents a study that introduces an additional element that is expected to improve the effectiveness of concrete columns confined with a non-code compliant confining reinforcement. The additional element, named a pen-binder, is used to keep the non-code compliant confining reinforcement in place. The effectiveness of this element under pure axial concentric loading was investigatedcomprehensively.The specimens tested in this study were 18 concrete columns,with a cross-section of 170 mm x 170 mm and a height of 480 mm. The main test variables were the material type of the pen-binder, the angle of the hook, and the confining reinforcement configuration.The test results indicate that adding pen-binders can effectively improve the strength and ductility of the column specimens confined with a non-code compliant confining reinforcement. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.",Column; Confinement; Hook; Non-compliance; Pen-binder,Column specimen; Concentric loading; Concrete column; Construction workers; Earthquake-resistant buildings; Indonesia; Non-compliance; Pen-binder; Seismic Performance; Columns (structural); Concrete construction; Earthquake resistance; Earthquakes; Hooks; Loading; Plasma confinement; Reinforced concrete; Strength of materials; Binders,"Kristianto, A.; Department of Civil Engineering, Maranatha Christian University, Jalan Suria Sumantri 65, Bandung 40164, Indonesia; email: anang.kristianto@gmail.com",,,19783051,,,,English,ITB J.

However, according to several studies, the ozonation disinfection process could form undesired by-products. One of the by-products potentially affecting human life is bromate produced from bromide ionic-containing water. This study was carried out to examine the effect of raw water characteristics and pH on bromate formation. Also, the performance of bromate formation for a period of exposure time was analyzed. Raw waters taken from four different areas around Bandung were exposed to ozone introduced to a reactor with a flow rate of 2 L/min. The pH of the raw waters varied from 4, 7 to 10. The results show that there was no evidence of an initial bromide ion concentration, whereas a change in pH value gives a significantly different outcome. In acidic condition (pH of 4) the bromate formation tends to decrease, whereas when the pH value increases to a pH of 10, the bromate formation increases. Therefore, for drinking water with a neutral pH, when bromide ions are detected in the raw water, the drinking water may be toxic due to the presence of bromate. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.",Bromate; Disinfection; Groundwater; Ozonation; PH,Acidic conditions; Bromate; Bromate formation; Bromide ions; Disinfection process; Exposure-time; Human lives; Neutral pH; Ozonation process; Pathogenic bacterium; pH value; Raw water; Bromine compounds; Disinfection; Groundwater; Ozone; Ozonization; pH; Ozone water treatment,"Syafila, M.; Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Institut Teknologi Bandung Jalan Ganesha 10 Bandung, Jawa Barat 40132, Indonesia; email: mindri@ftsl.itb.ac.id",,,19783051,,,,English,ITB J.

The results showed that when BPH or BHT was added at a concentration of 100 ppm, the oxidation induction period of the neat CME samples increased from 5.53 h to 6.93 hand 6.14h, respectively. Comparing both antioxidants, BPH proved to be more effective in increasing the oxidation resistance when both antioxidants were added at the same concentration. Furthermore, the oxidation induction time decreased linearly with the storage time. It was shown that the oxidation occurred rapidly in the first 8 weeks of storage.

This work is a preliminary evaluation of the feasibility of miscible flare gas injection based on phase behavior computations of a model oil (43%n-C5H12: 57%n-C16H34) and a model flare gas (91%CH4: 9%C2H6). The computations employed the multiple mixing-cell model with Peng-Robinson and PC-SAFT equations of state, and compared the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) value in the cases of flare gas injection and CO2 injection. For CO2 injection, both equations of state produced MMP values close to the measured value of 10.55 MPa. Flare gas injection MMP values were predicted to be 3.6-4.5 times those of CO2 injection. This very high MMP implies high gas compression costs, and may compromise the integrity of the reservoir.

In this research, a treatment control design in a lab-scale was controlled by a microcontroller circuit. The developed system combined anaerobic digestion, aeration and filtration process. Its logic control algorithm was designed by using Signal Interpreted Petri Net. In the logic verification, six analysis properties were satisfied: conflict free (logical process had no conflict behavior), termination (the process could be terminated from any state), non-contradictory outputs, live (any process state could always be reached from other state), deadlock-free, and reversible (the process could always back to initial condition). In the design evaluation, the average value of transparency metrics was 0.984 close to 1 as the best value. The system performance was evaluated by pollutant removal efficiency. The highest removal efficiencies were obtained when each anaerobic and aeration treatment were performed for three days respectively and followed by filtration.

The architecture is based on a lossless compression algorithm called Rice coding, which is optimal for an entropy range of 1.5 < H < 2.5 bits per sample. The architecture incorporates a word-splitting scheme to extend the entropy coverage into a range of 1.5 < H < 7.5 bits per sample. We have designed a data structure in a form of independent code blocks, allowing more robust compressed bitstream. The design focuses on an RTL computing model and architecture, utilizing 8-bit buffers, adders, registers, loader-shifters, select-logics, down-counters, up-counters, and multiplexers. We have validated the architecture (both the encoder and the decoder) in a coprocessor for 8 bits/sample data on an FPGA Xilinx XC4005, utilizing 61% of F&G-CLBs, 34% H-CLBs, 32% FF-CLBs, and 68% IO resources. On this FPGA implementation, the encoder and decoder can achieve 1.74 Mbits/s and 2.91 Mbits/s throughputs, respectively. The architecture allows pipelining, resulting in potentially maximum encoding throughput of 200 Mbit/s on typical real-time TTL implementations. In addition, it uses a minimum number of register elements. As a result, this architecture can result in low cost, low energy consumption and reduced silicon area realizations. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.",Counter-based coder; Hardware architecture; Lossless compression; RTL,Bit stream; Co-processors; Code blocks; Computing model; Counter-based coder; Encoding throughput; Entropy coders; FPGA implementations; Hardware architecture; Lossless compression; Lossless compression algorithm; Low costs; Low energy consumption; Register transfer level; Rice coding; RTL; Silicon area; Architectural design; Data structures; Energy utilization; Hardware; Image compression; Entropy,"Langi, A.

Applicable requirements also differ from country to country and government agencies and private enterprises have their own specifications. Assuming such temperature and relative humidity conditions, the present study is an attempt at evaluating the properties of hot weather concrete in fresh state with using a method of ready-mixed concrete. The fresh concrete was mixed and agitated at varying concrete and ambient temperatures. Three groups of the component materials, each material having such temperature as to bring resulting temperature of the fresh concrete to about 20°C, 30°C, 35°C, were chosen. The temperature of cement was conditioned to about20°, 40°C and 60°C for each of groups respectively. The aggregate was made warm enough to simulate the condition of outdoor pile in ready-mixed concrete plant. The temperature of tap water was always 20 °C as it was easily controlled and unlikely affected by outdoor temperature. With the fresh concrete prevented from evaporation, slump loss is caused solely by increased temperature of concrete. During agitation, the slump loss increases rapidly during the first 30 minutes but moderately during the remaining period. Concrete-placing temperature (upon arrival at the work site) could be estimated by a proposed formula derived from this study. Besides the freshly mixed concrete temperature, this formula also takes into consideration the ambient temperature, agitating time in transit and hydration heat. The achievement as described in this study may be useful to control concrete quality in terms of strength, shrinkage and other properties of concrete to be placed in hot-humid environment. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB &amp; PII.",Ambient temperature; Formula; Fresh concrete temperature; Ready-mixed concrete; Slump loss,Component materials; Concrete quality; Formula; Fresh concrete; Government agencies; High temperature; Hot weather; Hydration heat; Increased temperature; Mixed concrete; Outdoor temperature; Private enterprise; Properties of fresh concrete; Ready mixed concrete plants; Slump loss; Tap water; Temperature and relative humidity; Temperature range; Tropical countries; Work sites; Concrete mixers; Concrete placing; Piles; Quality control; Ready mixed concrete; Temperature; Mechanical properties,"Sampebuli, V.; Faculty of Engineering, Department of Architecture, HasanuddinUniversityIndonesia; email: vicsam@indosat.net.id",,,19783051,,,,English,ITB J.

In Indonesia, East Kalimantan province is one of the experiencing land area degradation due to intensive exploitation of natural resouces since 1970. The degradation model proposed in this study is modeled using a combination of ASTER and Landsat ETM+ imagery, both taken on February 27, 2001. The model composed of both two aspects: erosion aspect and vegetation aspect. Vegetation aspect is a function of suppression of vegetation from Crippen and Blom method and spectral angle a of Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) algorithm. The erosion aspect is calculated from erosion prediction and depends on the constant factors of b as well, and the latter is said as a function of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) value. Based on the validation using spectral based degradation map and Land Degradation Index of Chikhaoui et al, our model proves the ability to map land degradation, especially to better distinguish the classification of land degradation at very-slightly to very-severe intensity and the ability to differentiate water body, swamp or river.

The synthetic seismograms are constructed from an earth model, the CMT solution of the earthquake and station locations. The calculation is based on the GEMINI method, and the corner frequency is set at 20 mHz. Using deconvolutions of the station instruments responses, the measured and synthetic seismogram can be compared with the same units. The seismogram comparison indicates discre-pancies between recorded data and synthetic seismograms calculated from the anisotropic PREM model, in the travel times of Rayleigh and Love surface wave, as well as the S and core reflected ScS and ScS 2 body waves. Discrepancies of Love wave travel time and the number of oscillations are explained by changes in the crustal velocity model and by setting the positive gradient of β h in the upper mantle. While for Rayleigh waves and arrival times of body waves, corrections to the zero order coefficients of p are needed at layers in the mantle. The interpretation of the results of the waveform analyses indicates strong anisotropy in the upper mantle.

The results showed that the average oxidative stress index was highest in the Blank group (0.95 ± 0.24, 0.63 ± 0.23, 0.81 ± 0.27, respectively). Meanwhile, the concentration of α-Synuclein had decreased in all groups (0.09 ± 0.03, 0.15 ± 0.03, and 0.13 ± 0.02 ng/mg tissue, respectively). Correlation analysis showed that the oxidative stress index was inversely proportional to the concentration of α-synuclein. Our conclusion is that the midbrain of Wistar rats treated with rotenone indicated oxidative stress and led to an accumulation of α-synuclein protein. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.",Antioxidant; Neurodegeneration; Oxidative stress; Rotenone; α-synuclein,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",19783043,,,,English,ITB J.

Investigation of protein expression due to 2-ME was performed using primary antibodies Vimentin and GFAP. The amount of protein expressed was measured by immunodot blot and densitometry techniques. The results show that the average total change in Vimentin protein levels was higher (22.24% at gestation day 17 and 18) than in GFAP protein levels (15.10% on gestation day 12) in the treatment group. The 2-ME disrupted translation of Vimentin and increased the level of GFAP expression due to the cellular response to toxic materials. It can be concluded that the Vimentin protein is essential for the development of the brain, especially to stimulate cell proliferation for cell repair. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.",2-Methoxyethanol; Brain; Cell repair; Cell response; Disruption; GFAP; Proliferation; Protein translation; Vimentin,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",19783043,,,,English,ITB J.

The purpose of this study is to determine the role of trypsin in the internalization process of the influenza H1N1 virus in Vero and MDCK (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney) cells; to see whether trypsin can trigger the endocytosis route via receptor-mediated endocytosis or non-receptor-mediated endocytosis. The viruses were inoculated into Vero and MDCK cells under three conditions: (1) without trypsin in the medium (VVi and MVi); (2) with medium containing trypsin (VTVi1 and MTVi1); and (3) cells washed with trypsin prior to virus inoculation and incubated with medium containing trypsin (VTVi2 and MTVi2). Advance cytopathic effects (CPE) could only be observed in the MDCK cells. HA (hemagglutination) titer on the MDCK cells was higher than that on the Vero cells. Moreover, HA titer on MTVi1 was higher than MVi, and the lowest was found on MTVi2. Trypsin supported the internalization of the influenza virus by the cleavage of HA glycoprotein into HA1 and HA2. However, trypsin could halt the internalization of the influenza virus when the MDCK cells were washed with trypsin before virus inoculation. Trypsin could digest transmembrane protein containing sialic acid that is important for the virus internalization. Conversely, trypsin did not affect the internalization of the influenza virus in the Vero cells based on HA titer. This result was also supported by TEM observation, which showed that the ability of Vero cellsto internalize the influenza virus is very low. We suggest that a limited amount of sialic acid (α-2,6)-containing receptor on the membrane of the Vero cells can halt influenza virus internalization. On the other hand, active internalization of the virus was seen in all groups of MDCK cells (MVi, MTVi1, and MTVi2). However, trypsin could not trigger the internalization of the influenza virus in Vero and MDCK cells via non-receptor-mediated endocytosis. From this study it can be concluded that trypsin enhanced the internalization of influenza virus into MDCK cells by cleavage of the hemagglutinin (HA) of the virus, but did not improve the ability of the host cells to internalize the virus, especially via non-receptor-mediated endocytosis. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.",Influenza; MDCK cell; Trypsin; Vero cell,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",19783043,,,,English,ITB J.

One approach for controlling hyperglycemia is to use natural compounds derived from plants, such as Sansevieria trifasciata leaves, which are presumed to contain hypoglycemic agents. Sansevieria trifasciata leaves are widely used by the Sabah community in Malaysia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a decoction of Sansevieria trifasciata leaves on blood glucose levels and the density of granules in pancreatic β cells in alloxan-induced hyperglycemic rats. This study used a completely randomized design and 30 male Wistar rats that were 2 months old, and had a body weight in the range of 150-200 gram. The rats were divided into a group of normal rats as the control group and five groups of alloxan-induced hyperglycemic rats, each with 5 animals per group. The five groups of hyperglycemic rats were administered by aquadest, respectively: saline, as a diabetic control; 5mg/kg bw glibenclamide; 100 mg/kg bw, 150 mg/kg bw, and 200 mg/kg bw of the S.trifasciata leaf decoction, using 1 ml per 200 g body weight for 30 days. Histological examination of the pancreas was performed by paraffin section and Victoria Blue staining. The results of this study show that all doses of the Sansevieria trifasciata leaves decoction decreased the level of blood glucose and increased the granule density in the β cells of the islets of Langerhans of the alloxan-induced hyperglycemic (diabetic) rats. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.",Alloxan diabetes; Blood glucose; Sansevieria trifasciata; β granule cells,,"Qomariyah, N.; Department of Biology, Universitas Negeri SurabayaIndonesia; email: nurq.biounesa@yahoo.com",,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",19783043,,,,English,ITB J.

This antibody inhibits the EGF protein receptor, which is over-expressed on cancer cells in cancers such as colorectal, brain, pancreas, prostate, non-small cell lung, oesophagus, cervical and breast cancer. In order to obtain a higher efficacy agent for therapy of the above-mentioned cancers, nimotuzumab was labeled with beta particle- and gamma-emitter 177Lu. This report discusses the results of our in vitro and in vivo tests, which included cytotoxicity, clearance, imaging and biodistribution tests. The cytotoxicity test of 177Lu-DOTA-nimotuzumab on A 549 cell lines (lung carcinoma) was found to kill more cancer cells compared to that of unradiolabeled nimotuzumab. The clearance test of 177Lu-DOTA-nimotuzumab on normal rats showed that the residues of radioactivity were excreted mostly via the urine. The biodistribution and image tests showed that post injection of 177Lu-DOTA-nimotuzumab there was still some radioactivity in a number of organs, such as the kidney, liver and bone. Although the state of radioactivity post injection of 177Lu-DOTA-nimotuzumab in the above-mentioned organs was nearly the same as or slightly lower compared to other radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, precautions still have to be observed when this product is going to be tested on cancer patients. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.",Anti EFGR radiolabeled monoclonal antibody; In vitro; In vivo tests,,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",19783043,,,,English,ITB J.

These conditions motivate many researchers to look for alternative sources for insulating oil. One of the alternative liquid is palm oil. To verify the suitability of using palm oil as an insulating liquid, it is important to make dielectric properties comparison with the commonly used insulating liquid. This paper presents comparison of temperature effect on dielectric properties of palm oil with mineral type insulating liquid and silicone oil. The measured parameters were breakdown voltage, dissipation factor (tan δ), and dielectric constant. Breakdown voltage measurement was performed in accordance with IEC 156 standard, whereas, the dissipation factor and dielectric constant measurement were conducted based on IEC 60247 standard test methods. The results showed that variations of dielectric properties of palm oil to the temperature change, in general, have the same tendency with those of commonly used insulating liquids i.e. mineral oil and silicone oil. Breakdown voltages and dissipation factors of all tested oils were increased, while their dielectric constants were slightly decreased with the increase of temperature. © 2011 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.",Breakdown voltage; Dielectric constant; Dissipation factor; Insulating liquid; Palm oil,Alternative source; Dissipation factor; Dissipation factors; Insulating liquids; Measured parameters; Palm oil; Silicone oil; Standard test method; Temperature changes; Temperature variation; Biodegradation; Dielectric properties of liquids; Electric breakdown; Insulation; Mineral oils; Permittivity; Silicones; Vegetable oils; Liquids,"Rajab, A.; School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia; email: rajabdri@students.itb.ac.id",,,19783051,,,,English,ITB J.

Seismic refraction method has been proven as a useful geophysical tool for investigating shallow landslides. The objective of this study is to introduce a new workflow using neural network in analyzing seismic refraction data and to compare the result with some methods; that are general reciprocal method (GRM) and refraction tomography. The GRM is effective when the velocity structure is relatively simple and refractors are gently dipping. Refraction tomography is capable of modeling the complex velocity structures of landslides. Neural network is found to be more potential in application especially in time consuming and complicated numerical methods. Neural network seem to have the ability to establish a relationship between an input and output space for mapping seismic velocity. Therefore, we made a preliminary attempt to evaluate the applicability of neural network to determine velocity and elevation of subsurface synthetic models corresponding to arrival times. The training and testing process of the neural network is successfully accomplished using the synthetic data. Furthermore, we evaluated the neural network using observed data. The result of the evaluation indicates that the neural network can compute velocity and elevation corresponding to arrival times. The similarity of those models shows the success of neural network as a new alternative in seismic refraction data interpretation. © 2011 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.",GRM; Neural network; Refraction tomography; Shallow landslide,Arrival time; General reciprocal methods; Geophysical tools; GRM; Input and outputs; Landslide mechanism; Observed data; Seismic refraction; Seismic refraction data; Seismic velocities; Shallow landslide; Synthetic data; Synthetic models; Training and testing; Velocity structure; Data processing; Landslides; Refraction; Seismology; Tomography; Velocity; Neural networks,"Sompotan, A.

However, the conventional DTC which is based on hysteresis controller has major drawbacks, namely high torque ripple and variable inverter switching frequency. This paper presents an improved switching strategy for reducing flux and torque ripples in DTC of PMSM drives; wherein the torque hysteresis controller and the look-up table used in the conventional DTC are replaced with a constant frequency torque controller (CFTC) and an optimized look-up table, respectively. It can be shown that a constant switching frequency is established due to the use of the CFTC while the reduction of torque and flux ripples is achieved mainly because of the selection of optimized voltage vector (i.e. with an optimized look-up table). This paper also will explain the construction of DTC schemes implemented using MATLAB-Simulink blocks.

The presence of steel reinforcement in the beam was taken into consideration in the developed model. The models were verified by test carried out on other 9 beams. Those beams subjected to various-point loads and compressive strength. The results of investigation revealed that crack moment of inertia increased with the increased tensile reinforcement ratio. Thus, the reinforcement ratio significantly affects the value of effective moment of inertia of reinforced lightweight concrete beam. All the beam test results produced considerable deflection in comparison to that obtained using current Codes either ACI or SNI.

It is made of metallic wire formed to individual orthodontic cases. A specific geometry results in a set of force system, consisting of forces and moments, that provides specific movement effect when it is pre-activated to the adjacent teeth. Currently, orthodontists select its geometry depending on their knowledge and experience. It is based on separate and less-than-comprehensive literatures that not all orthodontists have access to. It may result in inaccuracies in treating individual tooth retraction case.

Castigliano method is used as the analytical approach, whilst finite element method is used as the numerical approach. The two simulation approaches were compared to the experiments to obtain the best simulation model. The behavior of the simulation models agree well with those of experiments.

Initial thickness is built by bandpass filtering the amplitude display of a zero-phase seismic. The filter removes the non minimum and or non maximum and left the maximum and or the minimum of seismic amplitude. The unresolved below-tuning thickness is then corrected by zero-INTENS-difference (z-i-d) attribute. INTENS is integrated energy spectra, an attribute which can be derived from spectral analysis. z-i-d attribute is zero difference of INTENS between the seismic and its synthetic. The method generates INTENS difference profile by subtracting seismic INTENS and its synthetic INTENS iteratively. The iteration is controlled by dipole space shifting from distance to closer or vice versa. The true thickness is derived by locating z-i-d which laid in INTENS different profile. It has found that, for free noise true seismic and perfect-wavelet (a wavelet which only approximately similar with wavelet which constructing the true seismic) synthetic seismic, in INTENS different profile, the z-i-d location always corresponds to true dipole space or thickness. The method could resolve all thickness of a wedge-modeled seismic with three different dominant frequencies. When the synthetic seismic is constructed with imperfect wavelet, slightly different analysis is needed to locate z-i-d attribute and the result is not as perfect as when perfect wavelet constructing synthetic seismic. A quiet similar result is got when the method is implemented for noisy wedge-modeled seismic. Bad thickness estimation is resulted for 20% noise seismic. The method algorithm is extended for similar dipole polarity model and multilayer model to bring the method to real seismic data nearer. The extension is done by estimating thickness of every layer of a stacked-wedge-modeled seismic. The algorithm then generalized for estimating layers thickness with several thickness combinations. The method was able to delineate shallow channel of Stratton Field by providing good pseudo-acousticimpedance (pseudo AI) map.",Below tuning; Integrated energy spectra; Intens; Seismic attribute; Seismic inversion; Seismic resolution; Spectral analysis; Thin layer,,"Purnomo, E.

This work develops a simple test method to evaluate the performance of agglomeration-resistant coating for granulated Buton asphalt, consisting of water-based polymeric primary coating and mineral-based secondary coating. The method uses a static load cell to measure the agglomerated granule count fraction under simulated storage conditions. A 2 4-1 fractional factorial experiment with two replications is employed to evaluate the effect of coating drying temperature, drying time, asphalt to secondary coating mass ratio, and secondary coating type on the agglomerated count fraction at ambient temperature and 60°C. The test is able to measure a statistically significant increase in agglomeration resistance when the coating is applied, with an agglomerated fraction of 17.5% at 60 °C. The test identifies asphalt to secondary coating weight ratio as a significant factor, with an ANOVA p-value much lower than other effects. A decrease in this mass ratio from 5:1 to 5:2 increases the agglomeration, which is hypothesized to be attributed to the hydrated cementitious phase between granular external surfaces.

The smaller the coefficient, the better the performance of the breakwater. A physical modeling on the proposed breakwater was conducted to identify the coefficient of Perforated Skirt Breakwater (PSB). The PSB model was tested in 2-D wave flume at Ocean Wave Research Laboratory FTSL ITB, to obtain the effectiveness of PSB for short-period waves (prototype periods, Tp= 4 second and smaller). The scaling of PSB models applies the principle of Froude Similarity, where the Froude number in model equals to the Froude number in prototype (Frm=Frp). The flume is equipped with 5 resistance-type wave probes and 8-channel DAS (Data Acquisition System). Wave heights (H) and wave periods (T) data were observed both manually by visual observation and wave probes readings (processed later with method of ""zero mean up-crossing"" technique). The incoming wave heights (Hi) and transmitted wave heights (Ht) were measured and processed to obtain the transmission coefficient (KT). The relationships between KT and non-dimensional variables (skirt draft/incident wave height, S/Hi) are analyzed and the calculated effectiveness of the PSB for varied environmental condition is obtained to be up to 70%.",Non-dimensional variables; Perforated skirt breakwater; Short-period waves; Transmission coefficient,,"Ajiwibowo, H.; Ocean Engineering Program, Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Bandung Institute of TechnologyIndonesia; email: ajiwibowoh@yahoo.com",,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",19783051,,,,English,ITB J.

Remote sensing provides a viable means to meet the requirement of improved regional-scale data set of paddy rice fields, such as phenological stages. A number of methods have been developed for detecting seasonal vegetation changes by using satellite images. Development of such methods to paddy fields with complex cropping pattern is still challenging. In this study, we developed a method for remotely determining phonological stages of paddy rice that uses time series of two vegetation indices (EVI and LSWI) obtained from MODIS data. We ran the algorithm to determine the planting date, heading date, and harvesting date of paddy rice in 5 districts of West Java Province, using the 8-day composite MODIS Surface Reflectance products (500-m spatial resolution) in 2004. Estimated harvesting dates were then used to calculate paddy rice harvested area. We validated the performance of the method against statistical data in 13 subdistricts. The root mean square errors of the estimated paddy rice harvested area against the statistical data were: 851 Ha for monthly data, 1227 Ha for quarterly data, and 2433 Ha for yearly data. Sub district-level comparisons of paddy rice harvested area between the MODIS estimation and statistical data showed moderate correlation, with coefficient of determination (r2) 0.6, 0.7, and 0.6 for monthly, quarterly and yearly data, respectively. The results of this study indicated that the MODIS based paddy rice phenological detection algorithm could potentially be applied at large spatial scales to monitor paddy rice agriculture on a timely and frequent basis.",Cropping pattern; MODIS; Paddy rice phenology; Remote sensing,,"Sari, D.

The specimen is to examine the behavior of shear link by using diagonal stiffener on web part under static monotonic and cyclic load. The cyclic loading pattern conducted in the experiment is adjusted according to AISC loading standards 2005. Analysis was carried out using non-linear finite element method using MSC/NASTRAN software. Link was modeled as CQUAD shell element. Along the boundary of the loading area the nodal are constraint to produce only one direction loading. The length of the link in this analysis is 400mm of the steel profile of WF 200.100. Important parameters considered to effect significantly to the performance of shear link have been analyzed, namely flange and web thicknesses, thickness and length of web stiffener, thickness of diagonal stiffener and geometric of diagonal stiffener. The behavior of shear link with diagonal web stiffener was compared with the behavior of standard link designed based on AISC 2005 criteria. Analysis results show that diagonal web stiffener is capable to increase shear link performance in terms of stiffness, strength and energy dissipation in supporting lateral load. However, differences in displacement ductility's between shear links with diagonal stiffener and shear links based on AISC standards have not shown to be significant. Analysis results also show thickness of diagonal stiffener and geometric model of stiffener to have a significant influence on the performance of shear links. To perform validation of the numerical study, the research is followed by experimental work conducted in Structural Mechanic Laboratory Center for Industrial Engineering ITB. The Structures and Mechanics Lab rotary PAU-ITB. The experiments were carried out using three test specimens with model and dimension identical to the model in the numerical study. Experimental testing apparently has shown results of the same behavior as predicted in the numerical study.

The work piece used was ductile cast iron FCD500 grade and the cutting tool was DNMA432 series (tungsten, uncoated carbide tool, SCEA = 0; and radius angle 55 deg). The analysis of results show that, the increase in the rake angle from negative to positive angle, causing the decrease in cutting force, effective stress and total Von Misses strain. The minimum of the cutting force, effective stress and total Von Misses strain were obtained at rake angle of +15 deg. Increasing the rake caused higher temperature generated on the edge of carbide cutting tool and resulted in bigger contact area between the clearance face and the workpiece, consequently caused more friction and wear. The biggest deformation was occurred in the primary deformation zone, followed by the secondary deformation zone. The highest stress was also occurred in the primary deformation zone. But the highest temperature on the chip usually occurs in secondary deformation zone, especially in the sliding region, because the heat that was generated in the sticking region increased as the workpiece was adhered by the tool and later it was sheared in high frictional force.",Cutting force; Deform-3D; Effective stress; Finite element method; Orthogonal cutting; Rake angle; Total Von Misses strain,,"Yanda, H.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Andalas Universityemail: hendri.yanda@ft.unand.ac.id",,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",19783051,,,,English,ITB J.

The Machang plain is covered with Quaternary fluvial sediments overlying granite bedrock. The drainage system is dendritic with the main river flowing into the South China Sea. In this study, the area was divided into two sites. Site-1 is the non-fertilized site, and Site-2 is the regularly-fertilized site. At shallow depth from the surface to depths of 75 cm a lower average geoelectrical resistivity values were obtained from the regularly fertilized site which has not been fertilized for the last ten months prior to the survey. The average resistivity values were around 0.366 times less in unfertilized sites. Residual nitrate and chloride were still present at the regularly chemically fertilized sites. At sites where no chemical fertilizer was added, the nitrate and chloride concentration were also found. These are due to the faces excretion of from the farm animals. The presence of nitrate and chloride content in pore water reduced the resistivity values. Thus despite low moisture content, the resistivity values to remain low.

The double sampling (DS) control chart is aimed at improving the capability to detect any small shift out-of control condition by observing the second sample without interruption. The capabilities of DS control chart were measured as the expected sample size (as a measure of inspection cost) or the control chart power (as a measure for customer risk). Optimization of these criteria is used to determine the control limits. In this paper, we optimize both producer and customer risks under a certain expected number of sample sizes as the constraint.

Aggregate gradation characteristic is important to avoid the premature cracking. The present study discusses a relationship between the characteristic of aggregate gradation and crack resistance of wearing course mixtures. Asphalt mixture specimens were prepared using different types of aggregate gradation. The Bailey method was employed in order to recognize the characteristic of aggregate gradations. Notched semi circular bending test was conducted to obtain the critical J integral (J c). The coarse aggregate (CA) ratio and the fine graded fine aggregate coarse (FG FA c) ratio defined by the Bailey method were introduced to recognize the effect of aggregate gradation type on J c. The result was decreasing the J c value with increasing the CA ratio and FG FA c ratio. Satisfying the current Bailey criterion on the CA ratio for stone mastic asphalt mixtures and setting FG FA c of fine graded HMA mixtures near 0.4 seem useful in order to obtain HMA mixtures with a high J c.

This development has negative impact to the environment. Considerable amounts of nutrient waste in dissolved and particulate form were released by intensive fish farming into the environment through feed excess, soluble fish excretion and faeces production. One of the first steps to avoid the dangerous environmental impacts is careful site selection to minimize environmental impacts arising from the farming activities (sustainability) as well as to guarantee adequate conditions from the operational point of view (suitability).The paper focuses on the development of a Decision Support System (DSS) as a tool for the appropriate selection of mariculture site location. The DSS is based on physical, chemical and sediment criteria as well as on data of conflicting coastal use. The GIS analysis results in a map indicating the suitable areas for the improved method of offshore cage mariculture. In this study, emphasis was placed on finfish species; however the methods and results may be employed for other species as well following some modifications. The DSS was applied for the western part of Java Sea, Indonesia. The data were acquired from direct field measurement, numerical modeling and existing information from particular agencies. Numerical modeling was used to obtain spatial and temporal distributions of hydrodynamic parameters (i.e. current velocities and water levels). The Delft3D modeling system (Delft Hydraulics, The Netherlands) was employed for this purpose. The DSS was developed under GIS application of ESRI® ArcGIS TM using weighted overlay method.

In this research, the Cu/ZnO/Al 2O 3 catalyst prepared by the dry impregnation was used. The specific surface area of catalyst was 194.69 m 2gram. The methanol steam reforming (SRM) reaction was carried out by means of the injection of gas mixture containing methanol and water with 1:1.2 mol ratio and 20-90 mL/minute feed flow rate to a fixed bed reactor loaded by 1 g of catalyst. The reaction temperature was 200-300 °C, and the reactor pressure was 1 atm. Preceding the reaction, catalyst was reduced in the H 2/N 2 mixture at 160 °C. This study shows that at 300 °C reaction temperature, methanol conversion reached 100% at 28 mL/minute gas flow rate. This conversion decreased significantly with the increase of gas flow rate.

To gain high values of TSS and fruit fresh weight, it is important to consider the concentration of nutrient solution, which is commonly represented by Electrical Conductivity (EC) value. Generally, the increasing of EC value not only increases the number of TSS, but also decreases fruit fresh weight. Therefore, it is important to optimize the EC value for both indicators of quality of tomato fruits. The objective of this research is to optimize the EC value of nutrient solution on each generative stage using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Algorithms (GA). ANN was used to identify the relationship between different EC value treatments with TSS value and fruit fresh weight. GA was applied to determine the optimal EC value in generative growth, which is divided into three stages. Results showed that the optimal EC values in the flowering stage, the fruiting stage and the harvesting stage were 1.4 mS/cm, 10.2 mS/cm and 9.7 mS/cm, respectively.",Artificial neural network; Genetic algorithm; Hydroponics; Tomato fruits quality,,"Suhardiyanto, H.; Department of Agricultural Engineering, Bogor Agricultural University, Bogor, Indonesia; email: herrysuhardiyanto@ipb.ac.id",,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",19783043,,,,English,ITB J.

Monitoring mangrove is therefore required to maintain a balance between economy and conservation and provides up-to-date information for rehabilitation. Optical remote sensing data have delivered such information, however ever-changing atmospheric disturbance may significantly decrease thematic content. In this research, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) fully polarimetric data were evaluated to present an alternative for mangrove mapping. Assessment using three statistical trees was performed on both tonal and textural data. It was noticeable that textural data delivered fairly good improvement which reduced the error rate to around 5-6% at L-band. This suggests that insertion of textural data is more important than any information derived from decomposition algorithm.",Mangrove; Mimika; Polarimetric decomposition; SAR polarimetry; Textural occurrence measures,,"Trisasongko, B.

One of the most interesting potential applications is in term of nanoelectronic device. Carbon nanotubes heterojunction has been modeled, which was built from two different carbon nanotubes, that one is metallic and the other one is semiconducting. There are two different carbon nanotubes metal-semiconductor heterojunction. The first one is built from CNT(10,10) as metallic carbon nanotube and CNT (17,0) as semiconductor carbon nanotube. The other one is built from CNT (5,5) as metallic carbon nanotube and CNT (8,0). All of the semiconducting carbon nanotubes are assumed to be a pyridine-like N-doped. Those two heterojunctions are different in term of their structural shape and diameter. It has been calculated their charge distribution and potential profile, which would be useful for the simulation of their electronic transport properties. The calculations are performed by using self-consistent method to solve Non-Homogeneous Poisson's Equation with aid of Universal Density of States calculation method for Carbon Nanotubes. The calculations are done by varying the doping fraction of the semiconductor carbon nanotubes The electron tunneling transmission coefficient, for low energy region, also has been calculated by using Wentzel-Kramer-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. From the calculation results, it is obtained that the charge distribution as well as the potential profile of this device is doping fraction dependent.",Carbon nanotube hetejunction; Doped carbon nanotubes; Molecular devices; Potential profile,,"Sukirno; Laboratory for Physics of Electronic Material, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB), Jl.

The comprehensive unit process performances are generated by a CFD engine. The CFD engine can simulate the unit process performances at whatever conditions. Both design geometry and operating variables were used on the CFD simulation. The burden on a simplified process was taken out from CFD simulation. A complex geometry of a unit process is represented by a secondary reformer. A secondary reformer has a conical chamber as a space to undergo a combustion reaction before entering a catalyst bed. This complexity is added by the boundary on a porous solid surface as the top surface of the catalyst bed. The conical angle affects the flow pattern inside the conical chamber having a porous solid surface as its base. The conical angle above 65° results the disappearing of the recirculation flow. The inlet distance from the porous solid surface also can exhibit different characteristics of recirculation flow. The closer the distance to the porous solid surface, the stronger the recirculation is. The inlet velocity values have no significant effect on the flow pattern. The introduction of a solid volume inside the geometry creates distortion in the flow pattern. In the application, the inserted solid volume is equivalent to a burner. It means that the use of the burner inherently produces some problems of the flow distribution.",CFD technique; Conical chamber; Geometry optimization,,"Bindar, Y.; Chemical Engineering Research Group on Energy and Processing System, Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Industrial Technology, Institut Teknologi BandungIndonesia; email: dhiebindar@yahoo.com",,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",19783051,,,,English,ITB J.

For the design purpose, the present study was intended to incorporate some important factors of the riser conditions (i.e. bidirectional vibration, free-end condition, and spanwise variation of response amplitude) for investigating its dynamics characteristics. An experimental investigation on time-dependent motion of a flexible free-hanging circular cantilever subjected to uniform cross-flows has been carried out. The free-end condition cantilever has a 34.4 aspect ratio and a low mass ratio of about 1.24. The cylinder freely oscillates in both inline and transverse to the flow. Reynolds number varied from 10,800 to 37,800. The ""jump phenomenon"" was found in the inline motion of the cylinder that agrees well with an existing comparable work. At high flow velocities, the 3rd higher harmonic frequencies of the cylinder transverse response became predominant that produce quite different motion characteristics compared to the other existing comparable works with 2-dimensional bottom-end condition. Generally, the results suggested that the flexible free-hanging cantilever generate different vortex wake mode than either, a uniform (a short-rigid flexibly-mounted cylinder) or a linear amplitude variation along the span case (a pivoted cylinder).",Bidirectional motion; Free-end condition; Free-hanging cantilever; Vortex wake mode; Vortex-induced vibration,,"Prastianto, R.
