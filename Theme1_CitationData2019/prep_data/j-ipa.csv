The quasi-experimental study was carried out with 82 form three (age 15 years old) students of a secondary school in Aceh Besar, Indonesia. The first author had randomly chosen two classes as the experimental group and two other classes as the control group. Independent samples t-test analysis was conducted to determine the difference between the physics teaching and learning module which integrated the five steps of engineering design process and the existing commonly used science “Pudak” teaching and learning module. The results of the independent samples t-test analysis showed that the use of the physics teaching and learning module which integrated the five steps of engineering design process was more effective compared to the use of the existing “Pudak” module in increasing the students’ skills in solving physics problems. The findings of the study suggest that the science learning approach is appropriate to be applied in the teaching and learning of science to enhance science problem-solving skills among secondary school students. In addition, it can be used as a guide for teachers on how to implement the integration of the five steps of engineering design process in science teaching and learning practices. © 2018 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semarang.","Engineering design; Magnetic field; Physics teaching and learning module; Science problem solving",,"Syukri, M.; Syiah Kuala UniversityIndonesia; email: syukri.physics@unsyiah.ac.id",,"Universitas Negeri Semarang",23391286,,,,"English","J.

Besides, it is a powerful approach to estimate technical efficiency when outliers contaminate the data set. Statistical data from general senior secondary schools in the period 2015/2016 is analyzed, using 34 provinces as decision-making units (DMUs), with eight input and six output variables. The results indicate that the average efficiency score of Indonesia’s major political subdivisions in managing high school education is 0.936. Furthermore, as many as 32.35 percents of provinces achieve efficient performances, with an efficiency score equal to one, while 17 provinces have above average efficiency scores. The results also indicate that efficiency scores from robust data envelopment analysis provide better accuracy.

The instruments were 17 modified questions which were developed from Pruneau’s framework. There are three linear perceptions regarding climate change. First, greenhouse effect causes global warming and global warming causes climate change. Second, ozone leakage causes global warming and global warming causes acid rain. Third, greenhouse effect causes ozone leakage and ozone leakage causes global warming; then it causes climate change and other climatic phenomena. Both pre-service science teachers and science teachers argue that climate change is caused by global warming. Actually, climate change is not only global warming but also global cooling. Those phenomena occur because of interactions among climate system components. They do not believe that education is able to change human attitudes in saving environmental sustainability from global climate change disasters. They believe that media give stronger effects than teachers in shaping those perceptions.

The Indonesian research project used paper and pencil tests and interviews to investigate students’ argumentation skills, while the Australian research project analysed videos of the lessons. The Indonesian study finds that there is no significant different between two types of schools and gender. The Australian classroom showed shifts in creative dispositions that include the argumentation processes but not a consistent pattern between classes. The Australian teachers actively required students to make claims, explore the robustness of these claims, transferred these claims to new settings and to think of alternative explanations that encouraged students to construct more coherent arguments.
