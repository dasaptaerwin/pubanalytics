Most of the real-world problems consist of constrained problem that is significantly important in modern engineering design and must be considered in order to perform any optimization task. Therefore, it is essential to compare the performance of the algorithm in diverse level of difficulties in constrained region.

The kind of traffic transmitted over the network was also considered. Riverbed Modeler Academic Edition was used to simulate two replicas of the library network. One of the simulated networks was logically segmented by implementing Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN). Statistics like traffic dropped, traffic forwarded, traffic received, broadcast traffic dropped and traffic sent in bits/sec or packets/sec were collected from both simulations and the results were analyzed and compared. The results from the simulations showed that the application of VLAN immensely enhanced the network performance by about 75%(depending on the size of the network) because the logical segmentation increased the number of broadcast domain while reducing each of the broadcast size.

A mesh-structure of electrodes is commonly used in substations to increase the contact to the surrounding earth with lower ground resistances. It is aimed to produce a layer with small and even voltage gradient over the soil surface. This paper focuses on the mesh-electrode grounding system. The electrodes are made of 8-mm diameter of stainless steel, whereas the lattice dimension of the mesh is 50cm ×50cm. Four variations of lattice number have been considered: 1-, 2-, and 4-lattice mesh structure. The structure was driven into the ground depth of 80-cm, being parallel to a surface of 20-cm thickness of grinded charcoal of coconut shells. The horizontal distance of each mesh-side to the surrounding earth wall was 10-cm. The influence of charcoal-layer thickness on the resulted grounding resistances has been investigated. Two soil conditions have been considered; dry soil and that with 50% of moisture content. Resistance measurements have been undertaken on each 10-cm layer addition upwards until the layers above the mesh-electrode reaching the surface level of earth. The ground field measurement results showed that each 10-cm charcoal-layer addition could lower the grounding resistance of the mesh-electrode system. The dry charcoal media produced the most effective decrease of resistance at the thickness of 60cm. The values of resistance obtained using 10cm thickness of charcoal layer in a mesh consisting of 1-, 2-, and 4-lattices are 268, 131, and 78 ohms consecutively. The addition of layer up to 80-cm resulted in a resistance decrease of 48%, 33%, and 44%. Using damp charcoal, the 10cm layer produced 26,5, 17,5, and 14,8ohms and a resistance decrease of 25%, 10%, and 3,6% subsequently for 1-, 2-, and 4-lattice mesh structure if the layer thickness became 80cm. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Coconut shell charcoal; Grounding media; Grounding resistance; Mesh-electrode",,"Dhofir, M.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Brawijaya UniversityIndonesia; email: dhofir@yahoo.com",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Due to its simplicity to collect, speech can be used as one of the input. The emotion information gathered from speech can be used to measure driver behavior state based on the hypothesis that emotion influences driver behavior. However, the massive amount of driving speech data may hinder optimal performance of processing and analyzing the data due to the computational complexity and time constraint. This paper presents a silence removal approach using Short Term Energy (STE) and Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR) in the pre-processing phase to reduce the unnecessary processing. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) feature extraction method coupled with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier are employed to get the driver behavior state recognition performance. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach can obtain comparable performance with accuracy ranging between 58.7% and 76.6% to differentiate four driver behavior states, namely; talking through mobile phone, laughing, sleepy and normal driving.

The recovery is performed on files that have been deleted from a file system. However, in order to recover a deleted file, some considerations should be taken. A deleted file is potentially modified from its original condition because another file might either partly or entirely overriding the file content. A typical approach in recovering deleted file is to apply Boyer-Moore algorithm that has rather high time complexity in terms of string searching. Therefore, a better string matching approach for recovering deleted file is required. We propose Aho-Corasick parsing technique to read file attributes from the master file table (MFT) in order to examine the file condition. If the file was deleted, then the parser search the file content in order to reconstruct the file. Experiments were conducted using several file modifications, such as 0% (unmodified), 18.98%, 32.21% and 59.77%. From the experimental results we found that the file reconstruction process on the file system was performed successfully. The average successful rate for the file recovery from four experiments on each modification was 87.50% and for the string matching process average time on searching file names was 0.32 second. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Aho-Corasick algorithm; Digital forensic; File recovery; File undelete; Finite state automata",,"Sitompul, O.S.; Department of Information Technology, Universitas Sumatera Utara, Kampus USU, Jl.

The contamination may lead to flashover voltage. As a result, flashover voltage could lead to service outage and affects negatively the reliability of the power system. This paper presents a dynamic model of ac 50Hz flashover voltages of polluted hydrophobic polymer insulators. The models are constructed using the regression tree method, artificial neural network (ANN), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy (ANFIS). For this purpose, more than 2000 different experimental testing conditions were used to generate a training set. The study of the ac flashover voltages depends on silicone rubber (SiR) percentage content in ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber. Besides, water conductivity (μS/cm), number of droplets on the surface, and volume of water droplet (ml) are considered. The regression tree model is obtained and the performance of the proposed system with other intelligence methods is compared. It can be concluded that the performance of the least squares regression tree model outperforms the other intelligence methods, which gives the proposed model better generalization ability. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Adaptive neuro-fuzzy (ANFIS); Artificial neural network (ANN); EPDM rubber; Flashover voltage; Regression tree",,"Abo-Elyousr, F.K.; Electrical Eng.

It has led to the addition of malicious circuitry known as Hardware Trojan. In this paper, a transition probability based node reduction technique for faster and efficient Hardware Trojan (HT) detection has been attempted. In the proposed method, the fact that the least controllable and observable nodes or the nodes with least transition probability are more vulnerable as Trojan sites is taken into consideration. The nodes that have lesser activity than the threshold are the candidate nodes. At each candidate node, segmentation is done for further leakage power analysis to detect the presence of Trojans. Experimental results observed on ISCAS'85 and ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits illustrate that the proposed work can achieve remarkable node reduction upto 78.81% and time reduction upto 58.7%. It was also observed that the circuit activity can be increased by varying the input probability. Hence, for further reduction in the Trojan activation time, the weighted input probability was obtained. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Hardware security; Hardware trojans; Segmentation; Transition probability; Weighted input probability",,"Devi, M.N.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amrita School of Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amrita UniversityIndia; email: m_nirmala@cb.amrita.edu",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Further, the process of extracting the masses in mammogram represents a challenging task facing the radiologists, due to problems such as fuzzy or speculated borders, low contrast and the presence of intensity inhomogeneities. Aims to help the radiologists in the diagnosis of breast cancer, many approaches have been conducted to automatically segment the masses in mammograms. Towards this aim, in this paper, we present a new approach for extraction of tumors from region-of-interest (ROI) using the algorithm of Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) setting two clusters for semi-automated segmentation. The proposed method meant to select as input data the set of pixels that enable to get the meaningful information required to segment the masses with high accuracy. This could be accomplished through eliminating unnecessary pixels, which influence on this process through separating it outside of the input data using an optimal threshold given by monitoring the change of clusters rate during the process of threshold decrementing.

Using this system and the generalized chaos synchronization (GCS) theorem constructs an 8-dimensional discrete generalized chaos synchronization (8DBDGCS) system. Using the 8DBDGCS system designs a 216-word chaotic PRNG. Simulation results show that there are no significant correlations between the key stream and the perturbed key streams generated via the 216-word chaotic PRNG. The key space of the chaotic PRNG is larger than 21275. As an application, the chaotic PRNG is used with an avalanche-encryption scheme to encrypt an RGB image.

The signal is disturbed by multiplicative noise where the number of segments is unknown. A Bayesian approach is proposed to estimate the parameter. The parameter includes the number of segments, the location of the segment, and the amplitude. The posterior distribution for the parameter does not have a simple equation so that the Bayes estimator is not easily determined. Reversible Jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is adopted to overcome the problem. The Reversible Jump MCMC method creates a Markov chain whose distribution is close to the posterior distribution. The performance of the algorithm is shown by simulation data. The result of this simulation shows that the algorithm works well. As an application, the algorithm is used to segment a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signal.

Thus, this makes the present instrument feasible for teaching support media in developing countries. The effectiveness of the present spectrophotometer for analyzing solution concentration (i.e. curcumin) was also demonstrated. Interestingly, the present spectrophotometer is able to measure the concentration of curcumin precisely with an accuracy of more than 90%. Different from commercially available standard UV-visible spectrophotometers that have limitations in the analysis of concentration of less than 50 ppm, the present system can measure the concentration with no limitation since the measurement is based on the LED light being penetrated. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Arduino; Concentration analysis; Curcumin; Light emitting diode; Spectrophotometer",,"Nandiyanto, A.B.D.; Department Kimia, Universitas Pendidikan IndonesiaIndonesia; email: nandiyanto@upi.edu",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

The secret message could not be revealed unless the recipients exchange and collect shares to reconstruct the actual message. Even though the attacker obtain shares shadow during the share exchange, it would be impossible for the attacker to understand the correct share. There are few algorithms have been developed for secret sharing, e.g. secret splitting, Asmuth-Bloom secret sharing protocol, visual cryptography, etc. There is an unanswered question in this research about which method provides best level of security and efficiency in securing message. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of three methods, i.e. secret splitting, secret sharing, and recursive threshold visual cryptography for handwritten image security in terms of execution time and mean squared error (MSE) simulation. Simulation results show the secret splitting algorithm produces the shortest time of execution.

To address this problem, probabilistic latent variable models have been used to perform face recognition across poses. Although these models have demonstrated outstanding performance, it is not clear whether richer parameters always lead to performance improvement. This work investigates this issue by comparing performance of three probabilistic latent variable models, namely PLDA, TFA, and TPLDA, as well as the fusion of these classifiers on collections of video data. Experiments on the VidTIMIT+UMIST and the FERET datasets have shown that fusion of multiple classifiers improves face recognition across poses, given that the individual classifiers have similar performance. This proves that different probabilistic latent variable models learn statistical properties of the data that are complementary (not redundant).

The filter utilized two operating bands centered at 2.45 GHz and 5 GHz widely used for wireless local area network applications. The filter consists of T-shaped sections of step impedance resonator. The structure is an even symmetrical around electrical or magnetic wall, so the operation mechanism of the filter can be analyzed by an evenand odd-mode transmission line theory. The resonator structure is parallel coupled to a pair of 50 O input/output ports. Proper feeding and coupling structures can realize at least two transmission zeros around each of the operating band. To enhance the spurs rejection in the out of the band response of the filter, additive transmission zero at 10 GHz was created by adding stub of quarter guided wavelength at a selected distant from the output port edge. The filter is designed and optimized using the full wave Electromagnetic simulator. The center frequency of the designed bands can be easily refined by the filter dimensions. The overall dimension of the filter is 0.3λg ×0.48λg (where λg is the guided wavelength at the frequency of 2.45 GHz) corresponding to 14.3 mm x 22 mm. © 2017 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Dual-band filter; Microstrip bandpass filter; SIR resonator; WLAN applications",,"Ahmed, E.S.; Department of Communication Engineering, University of TechnologyIraq; email: 30029@uotechnology.edu.iq",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

A process mining algorithm can generally discover the process model of an organization without considering the detailed process models of the departments, and the relationship among departments. The exchange of messages among departments can produce asynchronous activities among department process models. The event logs from departments can be considered as multi-source logs, which cause difficulties in mining the process model. Discovering process models from multi-source logs is still in the state of the art, therefore this paper proposes a hierarchy high-to-low process mining approach to discover the process model from a complex multi-source and heterogeneous event logs collected from distributed departments. The proposed method involves three steps; i.e. firstly a high level process model is developed; secondly a separate low level process model is discovered from multi-source logs; finally the Petri net refinement operation is used to integrate the discovered process models. The refinement operation replaced the abctract transitions of a high level process model with the corresponding low level process models. Multi-source event logs from several departments of a yarn manufacturing were used in the computational study, and the results showed that the proposed method combined with the modified time-based heuristics miner could discover a correct parallel process business model containing XOR, AND, and OR relations.","Double timestamp event log; Multi source log; Petri net; Process discovery; Process mining; Refinement operation; Time based heuristics miner; Time-based interval",,"Sarno, R.; Jurusan Teknik Informatika, Fakultas Teknologi Informasi, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember Kampus ITS Sukolilo, Jalan Raya ITS, Indonesia; email: riyanarto@if.its.ac.id",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Satellite images are captured using high quality cameras. These images are captured from space using on-board cameras. Wrong ISO setting, camera vibrations or wrong sensory setting causes noise. The degraded image can cause less efficient results during visual perception which is a challenging issue for researchers. Another reason is that noise corrupts the image during acquisition, transmission, interference or dust particles on the scanner screen of image from satellite to the earth stations. If quality degraded images are used for further processing then it may result in wrong information extraction. In order to cater this issue, image filtering or denoising approach is required. Since remote sensing images are captured from space using on-board camera which requires high speed operating device which can provide better reconstruction quality by utilizing lesser power consumption. Recently various approaches have been proposed for image filtering. Key challenges with these approaches are reconstruction quality, operating speed, image quality by preserving information at edges on image. Proposed approach is named as modified bilateral filter. In this approach bilateral filter and kernel schemes are combined. In order to overcome the drawbacks, modified bilateral filtering by using FPGA to perform the parallelism process for denoising is implemented.","Bilateral filter; Filtering; FPGA; Noise; PSNR; Satellite image",,"Sendamarai, P.; Nagarjuna College of Engineering and TechnologyIndia; email: sendamarai17@gmail.com",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

There is always a lack or inappropriate so that the harvest is not optimal or even harvest failure. Based on the background that has been described, we tried to create a toolkit that can be used to calculate success rate of the broiler harvest. With this toolkit, broiler farm owners are expected to have a guide and can make the right move in the period of broiler development. To calculate the success rate of broiler harvest, we used a model based on the performance index calculation. Toolkit that created running on local network environment using an Apache web server. The Toolkit uses JavaScript library to display the calculation results in the form of charts that are easier to understand. Based on the results of testing that has been done, this toolkit can perform calculations in a relatively short time, present the results of calculations with accurate information. The accuracy of success rate calculation toolkit reached 90%. It is obtained by comparing the performance index and the total weight of broiler that obtained when harvested.","Broiler harvest; Success rate; Toolkit",,"Sanmorino, A.; Universitas Indo Global Mandiri, Jl.Jend Sudirman No.629 Km.4, Indonesia; email: sanmorino@uigm.ac.id",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Recently, there has been growing interest in the area of recommender systems (RSs), specifically in context-aware recommender systems (CARS). Methods for generating context-aware recommendations were classified into pre-filtering, post-filtering, and contextual modelling approaches. While there exists a substantial amount of research on CARS, little attention has been paid to compare the three different contextualization paradigms. In this paper, we present the several novel approaches of the different variant of each of these three contextualization paradigms and present a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art comparisons across contextual pre-filtering, contextual post-filtering, and contextual modelling approaches. We then identify key challenges that need to be addressed by the current RS researchers.

Therefore, a gateway device will be needed to bridge the IP and non-IP network transparently since an IoT user is more likely to concern on the service provided by the IoT device, rather than the complexity of the network or device configuration. Since today ubiquitous computing needs to hide the architectural level from it users, the data & information centric approach was proposed. However, the data & information centric protocol is having several issues and one of them is device and service discovery protocol over IP & non-IP network. This paper proposed a pervasive device and service discovery protocol that able to work in interoperability of the IP and non-IP network. The system environment consists of a smart device with XBee Communication as the non-IP network that will send the device and service description data to the IP network using WebSocket. The gateway will able to recognize the smart device and sent the data to the web-based user application. The user application displayed the discovered devices along the services and able to send the control data to each of the smart devices. Our proposed protocol also enriched with the smart device inoperability detection by using keep-alive tracking from the gateway to each of the smart devices. The result showed that the delay for the user application to detect the smart device in the XBee network is around 10.13 ms delay, and the service average delay requested by the user application to each of the devices is 2.13 ms.","Interoperability; Pervasive; WebSocket; XBee",,"Akbar, S.R.; Faculty of Computer Science, University of Brawijaya, Jl.

Based on the gene expression measurements, microarray technology have proven powerful in gene expression profiling for discovering new types of diseases and for predicting the type of a disease. Enhancement, Gridding, Segmentation and Intensity extraction are important steps in microarray image analysis. This paper presents a noise removal method in microarray images based on Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD). VMD is a signal processing method which decomposes any input signal into discrete number of sub-signals (called Variational Mode Functions) with each mode chosen to be its band width in spectral domain. First the noisy image is processed using 2-D VMD to produce 2-D VMFs. Then Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) thresholding technique is applied to each VMF for denoising. The denoised microarray image is reconstructed by the summation of VMFs. This method is named as 2-D VMD and DWT thresholding method. The proposed method is compared with DWT thresholding and BEMD and DWT thresholding methods. The qualitative and quantitative analysis shows that 2-D VMD and DWT thresholding method produces better noise removal than other two methods.","Discrete Wavelet Transform; Empirical Mode decomposition; Image enhancement; Microarray images; Variational Mode Decomposition",,,,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

The proposed method selects the most suitable mode using thresholds (cluster energy consumption and new device acceptance) and cluster energy expectation.

This work describes a detector system of formalin presence in food which employs a series of polymer-based gas sensor and uses a neural network detection method. The sensors are the polymer-carbon composite which made of the polymer mixed with active carbon. There are four types of polymer used, i.e. Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) 6000, PEG200, PEG20M, and PEG1450. The polymer-carbon composite provided a unique characteristic when it is exposed to vapor of food with or without formalin. The resistance of each polymer is different for each detected vapor. The combination of those sensors gives a pattern of voltage output on the sensors when they are exposed certain gas so that every gas has its unique output pattern. The method of detection uses an algorithm of back-propagation of the neural network. That voltage pattern of sensors serves as input to an artificial intelligence program.

This research implements searching methods, namely Bloom Filter and Sequential Search algorithms, to find objects in a set of data. It aims to improve our system getting a proper item. Due to the possibility of False-Positive existence as a result of Bloom filter technique, there is a potentially inaccurate representation to object sought. Some parameters are influencing False-Positive, namely the number of objects, available bits, and the number of mapped-bit. A Combination of those parameters could decrease the level of False-Positive and improve their accuracy and faster accessibility. In this research, we use three data object variations with the biggest object size of 2000000. Cached objects used in our experiments are between 2 - 20% of variation from the generated objects.

With the increasing number of load demand, this condition is getting worse in recent years. Hence, utilizing addition devices to maintain and mitigate the oscillatory condition of power system is crucial. This paper proposed a method to mitigate power system oscillation by installing one of the flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices called solid phase shifter (SPS) and energy storage devices called capacitor energy storage (CES). To analyze the performance of power system with SPS and CES, the eigenvalue and damping ratio analysis are used. Time domain simulation is also investigated to analyze the dynamic behaviors of power system considering SPS and CES. Furthermore, increasing number of load demand is carried out to analyze how much load can be increased without increasing power to the grid. From the simulation, it is found that SPS and CES can mitigate low-frequency oscillation on power system indicated by highest damping, smallest overshoot, and fastest settling time. It is also found that load demand can be increased significantly when SPS and CES installed to the system.","CES; Damping ratio; Eigenvalue; Oscillatory condition; SPS",,"Wijanarko, R.S.; Departmen Teknik Elektro, Universitas Pertamina, Jl Teuku Nyak Arief, Indonesia; email: rahmat.sw@universitaspertamina.ac.id",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Next, the effect of fiber loss and higher order dispersion coefficients such as fourth and sixth-order dispersion coefficients were studied. It is found that RK4 gives a smaller error and the gain reduces while the bandwidth remains same in presence of fiber loss. The fourth-order dispersion coefficient broadens the bandwidth a bit while maintaining the gain and there are two narrow-band gains generated to the left and right-side of the broad-band gain.

Conventional mapping exploration methodologies analyse application-specific graphs by estimating its runtime behaviour using analytical or simulation models. However, the former does not replicate the actual application run-time performance while the latter requires significant amount of time for exploration. To map applications on a specific MPSoC platform, the application behaviour on cycle-accurate emulated platform should be considered for obtaining better mapping quality. This paper proposes an application mapping methodology that utilizes a MPSoC prototyped in Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).

However, the composition of LDPE polymer and boron nitride (BN) as nanofiller has neither been well understood nor producing a convenient result. Similarly, the dielectric spectroscopy measured at ""sub-hertz"" frequency has been of little interest among researchers since it is often influenced by ""conduction-like"" effect. This research identified the dielectric properties of LDPE nanocomposites filled with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanofillers by using dielectric spectroscopy technique. The dielectric loss and relative permittivity for three different filler concentrations were investigated under ""sub-hertz"" frequency ranges at room temperature. The cylindrical electrode with guard ring configuration was used to conduct the experiment, in accordance to the ASTM D150 standard. The results revealed that 5 wt% filled polymer has lower loss tangent and permittivity compared to the unfilled polymer, due to the strong interaction between nano-particle and the polymer. This strong interaction is believed to limit the movement of the polymer chain. The decrease in loss tangent also indicates lower quasi-DC at low frequency. However, further increase in the filler loading has recorded an increment in the value of permittivity and loss tangent. This higher effective permittivity is mainly due to the influence of the filler permittivity. © 2017 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Boron nitride (BN) nanofillers; Dielectric spectroscopy; Low density polyethylene (LDPE); Permittivity; Tangent delta",,"Ahmad, M.H.; Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MalaysiaMalaysia; email: mohdhafizi@utm.my",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Sequential pattern mining is the process to obtain sequential patterns from database. However, large amount of data with a variety of data type and rapid data growth raise the scalability issue in data mining process. On the other hand, user needs to analyze data based on specific organizational needs. Therefore, constraint is used to impose limitation in the mining process. Constraint in sequential pattern mining can reduce the short and trivial sequential patterns so that the sequential patterns satisfy user needs. Progressive mining of sequential patterns, PISA, based on single constraint utilizes Period of Interest (POI) as predefined time frame set by user in progressive sequential tree. Single constraint checking in PISA utilizes the concept of anti monotonic or monotonic constraint.

The degree of membership is designed with reference to the system response, in which ultrasonic sensor with 1cm resolution is used. Moreover, the rule base is determined and optimized to deal with microcontroller processing speed. In order to cater for the windup phenomenon, proportional and integrated antiwindup elements are integrated into the TSK-FLC model. This control strategy consumes less memory and is expected to increase the time response of the control system. The experiment and analysis is done on the actual forkloader unit of MHeLFAGV system.

In this paper, we present a confidence coefficient of base station based on a gridding approach to get a relative accurate NBS during the offline phase, and proposed a novel algorithm with Longest Common Subsequence Matching Degree (LCSMD) of base station vector (BSV), which uses the relative order of NBS sorted according to their RSS. To evaluate our proposed method, we collect the realistic data from GSM network. Results show that the method based on LCSMD improves the positioning accuracy compared to the original method. © 2017 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Confidence coefficient; GSM; LCSMD; Received signal strength",,"Hu, E.; Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Road No.10, Xitucheng, China; email: owen.hu@bupt.edu.cn",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

This cause is considerable economic loss to global media players since digital contents, once legitimately obtained, can be illegitimately shared through file sharing services on the Internet. Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems have been proposed to support the protection of copyrighted digital contents. Even though such systems have been widely adopted and promoted by global media players, they are based on proprietary mechanisms that usually work only in closed, monolithic environments. In this regard, systems based on watermarking technologies appear more suited to protect digital copyrighted content. This paper describes the implementation scheme of a DRM system able to ensure the copyright protection of digital content according to an innovative buyer-friendly watermarking protocol. The DRM system has been implemented by exploiting a cloud environment in order to improve the overall performance of the system. In particular, cloud behaves as a service infrastructural provider, since the content provider involved in the watermarking protocol uses cloud to speed up the watermark embedding process and to save storage and bandwidth costs needed to store and to deliver protected contents. © 2017 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Cloud environment; Digital copyright protection; Digital rights management",,"Frattolillo, F.; Department of Engineering, University of Sannio, Corso Garibaldi 107, Italy; email: frattolillo@unisannio.it",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

The routing algorithm, topology and switching technique are significant because of the most influential effect on the overall performance of Network-on-Chip (NoC). Designing of large scale topology alongside the support of deadlock free, low latency, high throughput and low power consumption is notably challenging in particular with expanding network size. This paper proposed an 8x8 XX-Torus and 64 nodes XX-Ring topology schemes for Network-on-Chip to minimize the latency by decrease the node diameter from the source node to destination node. Correspondingly, we compare in differences on the performance of mesh, full-mesh, torus and ring topologies with XX-Torus and XX-Ring topologies in term of latency. Results show that XX-Ring outperforms the conventional topologies in term of latency. XX-Ring decreases the average latency by 106.28%, 14.80%, 6.7 1%, 1.73%, 442.24% over the mesh, fully-mesh, torus, XX-torus, and Ring topologies. © 2017 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Network latency; Network-on-chip; Ring topology; System-on-chip; Torus topology",,"Phing, N.Y.; School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University Malaysia Perlis, Pauh Putra Main CampusMalaysia; email: nyenphing@gmail.com",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Earlier identification of this pervasive disorder could provide assistance in diagnosis and establish rapid quantitative clinical judgment. This paper presents an automated approach which can be applied to identify ASD gait patterns using three-dimensional (3D) ground reaction forces (GRF). The study involved classification of gait patterns of children with ASD and typical healthy children. The GRF data were obtained using two force plates during self-determined barefoot walking. Time-series parameterization techniques were applied to the GRF waveforms to extract the important gait features. The most dominant and correct features for characterizing ASD gait were selected using statistical between-group tests and stepwise discriminant analysis (SWDA). The selected features were grouped into two groups which served as two input datasets to the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier. This study demonstrates that the 3D GRF gait features selected using SWDA are reliable to be used in the identification of ASD gait using KNN classifier with 83.33% performance accuracy. © 2017 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Autism spectrum disorders; Gait classification; Ground reaction force; K-nearest neighbor; Stepwise discriminant analysis",,"Hasan, C.Z.C.; Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARAMalaysia; email: zawiyah.hasan@gmail.com",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Automatic image annotation refers to the process of automatically assigning relevant text keywords to any given image, reflecting its content. In the past decade many automatic image annotation methods have been proposed and achieved promising result. However, annotation prediction from the methods is still far from accurate. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose an automatic annotation method using relevance model and scene information. CMRM is one of automatic image annotation method based on relevance model approach. CMRM method assumes that regions in an image can be described using a small vocabulary of blobs. Blobs are generated from segmentation, feature extraction, and clustering. Given a training set of images with annotations, this method predicts the probability of generating a word given the blobs in an image. To improve annotation prediction accuracy of CMRM, in this paper we utilize scene information incorporate with CMRM. Our proposed method is called scene-CMRM. Global image region can be represented by features which indicate type of scene shown in the image. Thus, annotation prediction of CMRM could be more accurate based on that scene type. Our experiments showed that, the methods provides prediction with better precision than CMRM does, where precision represents the percentage of words that is correctly predicted. © 2017 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Automatic image annotation; CMRM; Scene information",,"Sahertian, J.; Departement of Informatics Engineering, University of Nusantara PGRI Kediri, Kampus 2, Mojoroto Gang I, No.6Indonesia; email: juliansahertian@unpkediri.ac.id",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Reclamation is carried out by heating a mixture of waste cooking oil and Fuller's Earth adsorbent and followed by filtration. Propyl gallate antioxidant is then added into the filtered oil. Four oil samples are investigated in this study: (1) new cooking oil (NCO), (2) waste cooking oil (WCO), (3) reclaimed oil (RWCO) and (4) reclaimed oil with propyl gallate antioxidant (RWCOPG). The AC breakdown voltage, moisture content and total acid number is measured for all oil samples according to the ASTM D1816, ASTM D1533 and ASTM D974 standard test method, respectively. The results show that the AC breakdown voltage is highest for the RWCOPG sample (28.08 kV), which is 0.4% higher than the standard requirement of 20 kV. The moisture content for this sample is 180.60 ppm, which is still below the allowable limit of 200 ppm. However, the total acid number is highest for the RWCOPG sample which suggests that it has high acidity. It is indicated that the antioxidant-reclaimed waste cooking oil has potential to be used as an insulating liquid for oil-immersed power transformers, but much work is still needed to reduce the total acid number of this oil. © 2017 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Breakdown voltage; Moisture content; Propyl gallate antioxidant; Reclaimed waste cooking oil; Total acid number",,"Chairul, I.S.; High Voltage Engineering Research Laboratory, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknikal Malaysia MelakaMalaysia; email: imransc@utem.edu.my",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

The approach combines the advantages of two state-of-the-art fusion techniques, namely Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Chebyshev Poly-nomial Analysis (CPA) fusion. Fusion using ICA performs well in transferring the salient features of the input images into the composite output, but its performance deteriorates severely under mild to moderate noise conditions. CPA fusion is robust under severe noise conditions, but eliminates the high frequency information of the images involved. We pro-pose to use ICA fusion within high activity image areas, identified by edges and strong textured surfaces and CPA fusion in low activity areas identified by uniform background regions and weak texture. A binary image map is used for selecting the appropriate method, which is constructed by a standard edge detector followed by morphological operators. The results of the proposed approach are very encouraging as far as joint fusion and denoising is concerned.

The theory obtains data sampling points while achieves data compression. The main content of this thesis is reconstruction algorithm. It's the key of the compressed sensing theory, which directly determines the quality of reconstructed signal, reconstruction speed and application effect. In this paper, we have studied the theory of compressed sensing and the existing reconstruction algorithms, then choosing three algorithms (OMP, CoSaMP, and StOMP) as the research. On the basis of summarizing the existing algorithms and models, we analyze the results such as PSNR, relative error, matching ratio and running time of them from image signal respectively. In the three reconstruction algorithms, OMP algorithm has the best accuracy for image reconstruction. The convergence speed of CoSaMP algorithm is faster than that of the OMP algorithms, but it depends on sparsity K quietly.

This proposed four element dualband MIMO antenna occupies a 270 × 210 × 100 mm3 of FR 4 substrate.

Cornered spatial groundplane pattern yields a largest bandwidth (VSWR ≤ 2) 282 MHz or 15.24% of center frequency at low frequency. Full groundplane pattern creates 135.2 MHz at high frequency. In addition, cornered spatial groundplane pattern also generates a lowest VSWR that is valued 1.21 at both low frequency and high frequency. The S parameters, basically both cornered spatial and full groundplane pattern produce a better return loss than two others.

An experimental model is presented in this paper for the diurnal variability of UWAN of the acoustic underwater channel in tropical shallow water. Different segments of data are measured diurnally at various depths located in the Tanjung Balau, Johor, Malaysia. Most applications assume that the noise is white and Gaussian. However, the UWAN is not just thermal noise but a combination of turbulence, shipping and wind noises. Thus, it is appropriate to assume UWAN as colored rather than white noise. Site-specific noise, especially in shallow water often contains significant non-Gaussian components. The real-time noise segments are analyzed to determine the statistical properties such as power spectral density (PSD), autocorrelation function and probability density function (pdf). The results show the UWAN has a non-Gaussian pdf and is colored. Moreover, the difference in UWAN characteristics between day and night is studied and the noise power at night is found to be more than at the day time by around (3-8dB). © 2017 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Colored noise; Non-gaussian statistics; Underwater acoustic noise",,"Al-Aboosi, Y.Y.; Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MalaysiaMalaysia; email: alaboosiyasin@gmail.com",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Accordingly, rule-based selection method is common used to predict user purchase behavior by the call center. Unfortunately, rule-based approach not only ignores the user's previous behavior information entirely, and it is difficult to make use of the existing interaction records between users and products. Consequently, it will not get desired results if we just use the basic selection method to predict user purchase behavior directly, because the problem is that the features straightly extracted from the interaction data records are limited. In order to solve the problem above, this paper proposes a two-stage algorithm that based on K-Means Clustering Algorithm [2] and SVM [3, 4] Classification Algorithm. Firstly, we get the potential category information of products by K-Means Clustering Algorithm, and then use SVM Classification Model to predict users purchasing behavior. This two-stage prediction model not only solves the feature shortage problem, but also gives full consideration to the potential features between users and product categories, which can help us to gain significant performance in call center product recommendation field. © 2017 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Call center; K-Means; Purchase prediction; SVM",,"Shuang, K.; State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing Universiy of Posts and TelecommunicationsChina; email: shuangk@bupt.edu.cn",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Because streaming interactivity for VoD service causes frequent video lookup, the video lookup performance of MP2P-based VoD systems is significant for system quality of service (QoS) and user quality of experience (QoE). In this paper, we propose a novel Clustering Tree-based Video Lookup strategy for supporting VCR-like operations in MANETs (CTVL). CTVL builds the binary tree composed of chunks with high popularity by investigation of playback and switchover frequency of users for video chunks. Based on the built binary tree, CTVL designs a construction method of node community to group nodes into different communities in terms of cached chunks and defines the logical links between communities, which reduces maintenance cost of community structure and achieves high system scalability. CTVL also designs a video chunk lookup strategy, which makes use of the logical links between communities to achieve fast video chunk lookup. Extensive tests show how CTVL achieves much better performance results in comparison with other state of the art solutions. © 2017 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Binary tree; Community; Video chunk",,"Guo, Y.; Academy of Information Technology, Luoyang Normal University, 6# jiqing RD, China; email: 307806@qq.com",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

The research of speech recognition in Indonesia is relatively limited. This paper has studied methods of feature extraction which is the best among the Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for speech recognition in Indonesian language. This is important because the method can produce a high accuracy for a particular language does not necessarily produce the same accuracy for other languages, considering every language has different characteristics. Thus this research hopefully can help further accelerate the use of automatic speech recognition for Indonesian language. There are two main processes in speech recognition, feature extraction and recognition. The method used for comparison feature extraction in this study is the LPC and MFCC, while the method of recognition using Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The test results showed that the MFCC method is better than LPC in Indonesian language speech recognition. © 2017 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Linier predictive coding; Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients; Speech recognition",,"Endah, S.N.; Informatics Department, Faculty of Science and Mathematics, Universitas Diponegoro, Jl.

In this work, several simulations were performed and discussed for both schemes. In the first simulation, the device energy consumption is examined. After that, the number of devices that get rejected is studied. The device discovery processes in multi cluster head scenario, which is cluster head rotation, are examined in this paper.

The problem is raised when the number of instances of one class far exceeds the other. In the previous research, our DNA barcode-based Identification System of Tuna and Mackerel was developed in imbalanced dataset. The number of samples of Tuna and Mackerel were much more than those of other fish samples. Therefore, the accuracy of the classification model was probably still in bias. This research aimed at employing Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to yield balanced dataset. We used k-mers frequencies from DNA barcode sequences as features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as classification method. In this research we used trinucleotide (3-mers) and tetranucleotide (4-mers). The training dataset was taken from Barcode of Life Database (BOLD). For evaluating the model, we compared the accuracy of model using SMOTE and without SMOTE in order to classify DNA barcode sequences which is taken from Department of Aquatic Product Technology, Bogor Agricultural University. The results showed that the accuracy of the model in the species level using SMOTE was 7% and 13% higher than those of non-SMOTE for trinucleotide (3-mers) and tetranucleotide (4-mers), respectively.

One of the requirements is an active component selection (e.g. Op Amp). As an ideal communication system, VLC system has to be able to provides wide bandwidth access with minimum noise. The Transimpedance amplifiers (TIAs) is one of main components in optical system which is placed in the first stage of receiver system. It is used to convert the current output from photodiode to voltage. We have designed a 1 MHz fGBW TIA with low noise (in μVrms range). This paper aims to explain the design and implementation of TIA circuit with photovoltaic topology which cover empirical calculations and simulation of TIA's bandwidth and its noise sources, i.e. resistor feedback noise, current noise, voltage noise and total noise based on RSS. The OP-AMP is chosen from Texas Instruments product, OPA 380, and photodiode is chosen from OSRAM, SFH213, then simulated by TINA-TI SPICE® software. The noise in TIA circuit is analyzed clearly.

As an alternative, our lab developed a new type of speech detection system using bio-radar. This novel speech detection method may effectively compensate for the shortcomings of the traditional microphone because of the special features of bio-radar. However, the detected radar speech is also corrupted by specific electromagnetic and ambient noises. Therefore, this study proposes a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) short-time spectral amplitude estimate algorithm to enhance radar captured speech. Because the proposed approach employs an optimal spectral amplitude estimator as well as a method to minimize the mean-square error of the log-spectra in enhancing noisy speech, this algorithm significantly reduces the colored residual noise. The enhanced radar speech was evaluated by both subjective and objective quality evaluation methods. The results demonstrate that the bio-radar can successfully detect speech signal and the proposed speech enhancement algorithm can improve radar captured speech quality.","94 GHz; Millimeter wave; Radar; Speech enhancement",,"Li, S.; College of Science, Xijing UniversityChina; email: sheng@mail.xjtu.edu.cn",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

The separations between the plates are supported by four rectangular Teflon block and 1 mm of groove is proposed at the center of the upper plate to maintain the measurement repeatability. The groove enables the samples which are slightly higher than 2 cm to be fitted well between the plates without introducing extra force to the plates. The performance of both parallel plates has been compared in the frequency range from 100 MHz to 1.1 GHz. It is found that the upgraded parallel plate offers better return loss and insertion loss above 500 MHz compared to the previous parallel plate. It is reported from this work that the return loss of the parallel plate must be lower than -15 dB in order to achieve accurate dielectric constant. However, the insertion loss of the parallel plates does not influence the real permeability significantly. The upgraded TEM parallel plate produces a consistent reading with a standard deviation of less than 0.05 above frequency 200 MHz. The dielectric measurement of Polypropylene (PP) has proven the capability of this upgraded TEM parallel plate.","Dielectric constant; Dielectric measurement; Transverse electromagnetic parallel plates",,"Yee, S.K.; Center for Applied Electromagnetic, Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn MalaysiaMalaysia; email: skyee@uthm.edu.my",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

A facial watermark is embedded into fingerprint image using a method of singular value replacement. First, the DWT is used to decompose the fingerprint image from the spatial domain to the frequency domain and then the facial watermark is embedded in singular values (SV's) obtained by application of SVD. In addition, the original fingerprint image is not required to extract the watermark.

This paper proposes energy detector-based distributed sequential cooperative spectrum sensing over Nakagami-m fading, as a tool to solve the hidden node problem. The derivation of energy detection performance over Nakagami-m fading channel is presented. Since the observation represents a random variable, likelihood ratio test (LRT) is known to be optimal in this type of detection problem. The LRT is implemented using the Neyman-Pearson Criterion (maximizing the probability of detection but at a constraint of false alarm probability). The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated both by numerical analysis and simulations. The effect of cooperation among a group of CR nodes and system parameters such as SNR, detection threshold and number of samples per CR nodes is investigated.

Therefore, an integrity monitoring system is an inseparable part of aviation navigation system. Failures or faults due to malfunctions in the systems should be detected to keep the integrity of the system intact. In order to solve the problem that least squares method detects and isolates a satellite fault for GPS integrity monitoring, in this paper, a weighted least squares algorithm is proposed for satellite fault detection and isolation. The algorithm adopts the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix of GPS measurement equation as the weighted factor. Firstly, the weighted least squares approach for satellite fault detection establishes the test statistic by the sum of the squares of the pseudo-range residuals of each satellite for GPS. Then, the detection threshold is obtained by the false alarm rate of the fault detection, probability density function and visiable satellite number.The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated in a problem of GPS (Global Positioning System) autonomous integrity monitoring system. Through the real raw measured GPS data,based on least squares RAIM method and the weighted least squares RAIM approach, the performance of the two algorithms is compared. The results show that the proposed RAIM approach is superior to the least squares RAIM algorithm in the sensitivity of fault detection and fault isolation performance for GPS integrity monitoring.","BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS); Fault detection; Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS); Global Positioning System (GPS); Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM); Weighted Least squares method",,"Wang, E.; Shenyang Aerospace UniversityChina; email: wes2016@126.com",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Unlike rough set approach that uses similarity approach, the novelty of this approach uses a co-occurrence approach of soft set. We compare the proposed approach and rough set approaches on computational complexity and cluster purity. The results show that the proposed soft set approach achieves lower computational complexity with the improvement of more than 100% and higher cluster purity as compared to rough set-based approaches.","Clustering; Rough set theory; Soft set theory; Web user transactions",,"Sutoyo, E.; Department of Information Systems, Telkom UniversityIndonesia; email: edisutoyo89@gmail.com",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Hence, for each step of tuning the fuzzy domain, about 20% of imprecision and inaccuracy had been added automatically into the variable universe fuzzy, while the control input was bound via scaling gain. Furthermore, the simulation results showed that the tuning of universe fuzzy parameters could increase the performance of the system from the aspects of response time and error for steady state through better control of inaccuracy. Besides, the domains of universe fuzzy input [-4,4] and output [0,6] exhibited good performance in inching towards zero values as the steady state error was about 1% for x(t) position, 0.02% for y(t) position, and 0.16% for Θ(t) orientation, whereas the posture error in the given reference was about 0.0002% .","Fuzzy logic controller; Kinematic model; Non-holonomic system; Posture error; Variable universe of discourse",,"Nurmaini, S.; Computer Engineering Department, Universitas SriwijayaIndonesia; email: sitinurmaini@gmail.com",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

By using a non-linear approach, the prediction of precipitation produces more accurate results. Genetic algorithm (GA) functioning chooses precipitation period which forms the best model. To prevent early convergence, testing the best combination value of crossover rate and mutation rate is done. To test the accuracy of the predicted results are used Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as a benchmark. Based on the RMSE value of each method on every location, prediction using GA-Non-Linear Regression is better than Fuzzy Tsukamoto for each location.

Finally, the averaging results of that segments, was the feature extraction of the input signal.

This method is based on the even-harmonic characteristic of the circulating current and the potential feature of repetitive control that it has an internal integration part. The pole diagram of the closed loop transform function of the proposed control system proves the stability of the proposed method.

This is an important step, since the binarization outcome determines the success rate of the optical character recognition (OCR). In ancient documents, that are commonly noisy, binarization becomes more difficult. The noise can reduce binarization performance, and thus the OCR rate. This paper proposes a new binarization approach based on an assumption that the histograms of noisy documents consist of multipeaks. The proposed method comprises three steps: histogram calculation, histogram smoothing, and the use of the histogram to track the first valley and determine the binarization threshold. In our simulations we used a set of Jawi ancient document images with natural noises. This set is composed of 24 document tiles containing two noise types: show-through and uneven background. To measure performance, we designed and implemented a point compilation scheme. On average, the proposed method performed better than the Otsu method, with the total point score obtained by the former being 7.5 and that of the latter 4.5. Our results show that as long as the histogram fulfills the multipeak assumption, the proposed method can perform satisfactorily.","Global thresholding; Image binarization; Multipeak histogram; Noisy document; OCR",,"Arnia, F.; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Syiah Kuala University, Jl.

This study describes a method of diagnosis for IGBT open-circuit faults in MVD whose topology is cell series of multi-level. This method combines wavelet transform (WT) and support vector machine (SVM). The wavelet transform is used to extract fault features and SVM is used to classify the fault states of a single power unit. Then, the trained SVM classifier is used to scan all power units of MVD sequentially. Results of simulation on the platform of MATLAB/Simulink show that this method has a good diagnosis capability.

In order to test the low resource features, we also conducted experiments for the system without employing the word list feature and the word normalization. Our results indicated that different treatment of different types of machine learning algorithms with low resource features can lead to a good accuracy score. Here, we tried Naïve Bayes, C4.5, Random Forest and SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization) algorithms using Weka as the machine learning tools. For the Naïve Bayes, due to the data distribution based of the class probability, the best accuracy was achieved by removing data duplication. For C4.5 and Random Forest, SMOTE gave higher accuracy result compared to the original data and the data with data duplication removal. For SMO, there is no significant difference among various sizes of training data. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Indonesian Entity Tagger; Labor strike tweets; SMOTE; Supervised learning; Word level feature; Word window feature","Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Learning systems; Optimization; Probability distributions; Sodium; Supervised learning; Indonesian Entity Tagger; Labor strikes; SMOTE; Word level; Word window feature; Learning algorithms","Purwarianti, A.; School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Bandung Institute of Technology, Jl.

To extend the applicability of the system, a coordinated trajectory tracking of mixed type of mobile robots is considered. We prove that if a certain type of wheeled mobile robot is able to individually track its own reference, then coordination in tracking with other type of robots can be achieved simply by sharing individual tracking errors. Using two types of wheeled mobile robots, namely unicycle types (a nonholonomic mobile robot) and omni wheels type (a holonomic mobile robot), a coordinated control algorithm can achieve a global asymptotically stable condition of the error dynamics of the systems. Under bidirectional communication between robots as a constraint, the group is able to maintain individual tracking while coordinating the movements with other robots regardless occurring perturbations in the system and delays in communication channels. Simulation results suggest that information sharing between the robots increase the robustness in coordinating individual trajectories. Results also show that delays cause drop in performance similar to the case of no information sharing. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Coordinated trajectory tracking; Lyapunov function; Omni wheels robots; Time delays; Unicycles","Information analysis; Information dissemination; Lyapunov functions; Mobile robots; Time delay; Trajectories; Vehicles; Wheels; Asymptotically stable; Bi-directional communication; Communication delays; Non-holonomic mobile robots; Omni-wheel; Trajectory tracking; Unicycles; Wheeled mobile robot; Robots","Adinandra, S.; Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Industrial Technology, Universitas Islam Indonesia, Gedung K.H.

Another strategy is to substitute the absent personnel member in orderto keep the number of attendees above the quorum, namely the substitution strategy. This paper adapts amechanism design approach, which is Clarke Tax Mechanism, in order to implement incentivecompatibility and individual rationality principle in meeting scheduling. By using the unassignment strategyand substitution strategy, the meetings can still be held simultaneously according to the schedule withoutthe need for rescheduling.

Taking sixtyfour switch states into consideration, the operational states of hybrid clamped three-level inverter and different current circuits in different switch states were detailed derived. Optimal modulation algorithm was proposed based on the neutral small vectors by different combination, which can realize the automatic balancing of the neutral-point voltage with few switching cycles and did not need to measure the voltage of the clamped capacitors. The proposed modulation algorithm was also capable of restraining the turn-offover-voltage of the power switching devices effectively. Simulation results were given to verify the feasibility and correctness.

Failures or faults due to malfunctions in the systems should be detected and isolated to keep the integrity of the GNSS intact. Because the pseudorange residual noise of navigation satellites does not follow the Gaussian distribution perfectly, and the performance of traditional filtering algorithms, such as the Kalman filter, might degrades for non-Gaussian noise. The particle filter algorithm has great advantage to handle the nonlinear and non-Gaussian system. Therefore, in this paper, the particle filter algorithm is employed to GNSS receiver autonomous integrity monitoring(RAIM) to detect the fault of navigation satellite. The log-likelihood ratio(LLR) test is established. By checking the consistency between the state estimate of the main particle filter and that of the auxiliary particle filters, the fault of navigation satellite will be effectively detected. And then, the novel RAIM algorithm is undertaken by field programmable gate array(FPGA). Moreover, the modules of the proposed RAIM algorithm is implemented. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated in a problem of GPS (Global Positioning System) autonomous integrity monitoring system.

The goal of this research is to determine the most optimal of HPC infrastructure to solvehigh complexity problem. For this reason, we chose Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a case studyand Genetic Algorithm as a method to solve TSP. Travelling Salesman Problem is belonging often thecase in real life and has a high computational complexity. While the Genetic Algorithm (GA) belongs areliable algorithm to solve complex cases but has the disadvantage that the time complexity level is veryhigh. In some research related to HPC infrastructure comparison, the performance of multi-core CPUsingle node for data computation has not been done. The current development trend leads to thedevelopment of PCs with higher specifications like this. Based on the experiments results, we concludethat the use of GA is very effective to solve TSP. the use of multi-core single-node in parallel for solvinghigh complexity problems as far as this is still better than the two other infrastructure but slightly belowcompare to multi-core single-node serially, while GPU delivers the worst performance compared to othersinfrastructure. The utilization of a super computer PC for data computation is still quite promisingconsidering the ease of implementation, while the GPU utilization for the purposes of data computing isprofitable if we only utilize GPU to support CPU for data computing. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

Classification problem especially for high dimensional datasets have attracted many researchers in order to find efficient approaches to address them. However, the classification problem has become very complicated and computationally expensive, especially when the number of possible different combinations of variables is so high. Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been proven to perform much better when dealing with high dimensional datasets and numerical features. Although SVM works well with default value, the performance of SVM can be improved significantly using parameter optimization. We applied two methods which are Grid Search and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the SVM parameters. Our experiment showed that SVM parameter optimization using grid search always finds near optimal parameter combination within the given ranges. However, grid search was very slow; therefore it was very reliable only in low dimensional datasets with few parameters. SVM parameter optimization using GA can be used to solve the problem of grid search. GA has proven to be more stable than grid search. Based on average running time on 9 datasets, GA was almost 16 times faster than grid search. Futhermore, the GA's results were slighlty better than the grid search in 8 of 9 datasets. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Genetic algorithms; Parameter optimization; Support vector machine","Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Problem solving; Support vector machines; Average running time; Classification performance; Data classification problems; Default values; High dimensional datasets; Low dimensional; Numerical features; Parameter optimization; Classification (of information)","Syarif, I.; Politeknik Elektronika Negeri SurabayaIndonesia; email: iwanarif@pens.ac.id",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

This technique is better than Digital Signatures and other methods because it does not increase overhead. Watermarking adds the additional requirement of robustness. To improve the robustness of digital image watermarking method based on the image frequency, this paper adopts the intermediate frequency to embed the watermarking and proposes an digital image watermarking algorithm based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) and discrete cosine transform (DCT). Firstly, the high frequency part and the low frequency part of the image are extracted by the RPCA algorithm. Because the high frequency part has complex statistical characteristics, this paper processes the high frequency part with ""8×8"" DCT method to obtain intermediate frequency coefficients and then the watermarking information is embedded into the obtained intermediate frequency coefficients.

Clustering is a technique for enhance the network lifetime in WSN. Here in this paper we propose a new multi-objective adaptive swarm optimization (MASO) technique for clustering and computes the maximum number of clusters, which is best suited for the network. Each cluster has cluster head and cluster members and performed the task of local information extraction. Cluster head gathers all the extracted information from member nodes and send it to the base station, where base station performed global information extraction from all the cluster head nodes and generate some useful result. In MASO technique, object is used to find the best global position for the node and compare with existing position value. If new value is better than the old value, than node moves to a new position and object update their table for this new position. We are considering error probability in transmission of data packet in one hop communication. Here obtained the results are compared with other research in terms of overall network lifetime and effect on network lifetime when the size of the network is changed.

Therefore, we need to identify significant components which have great impact on the system reliability.

However, error propagation is also an important factor on the system reliability. To attack the problem, we propose an improved component ranking framework, named DCR, to identify significant components in cloud applications. DCR employs two individual algorithms to rank the components twice and determines a set of the most significant components based on the two ranking results.

On a shrimp pond, water conditions are very vital because it has a very strict threshold. Unstable water conditions will affect growth and condition of shrimps, eat passion of shrimps, until their ability to survive greatly affect the survival of the shrimps. The percentage of farmers harvesting shrimps if the water did not have good conditions then the farmers will suffer significant losses if yields were not as expected, began from the amount of shrimp that was reduced due to death or the quality of the shrimp were judged from the size of the shrimp. So the authors wanted to do research on how to maintain the quality of the water in shrimp pond so that the water quality is maintained. To overcome this, we need to monitor water conditions based on the level of salinity and turbidity of water in order to stay in good condition. In this case, the researchers used fuzzy logic to monitor the amount of water quality and water volume.

For its shortcomings such as low positioning accuracy, vulnerable to wormhole attack and block attacks, a new location algorithm for wireless sensor network security SDV-HOP is proposed. Firstly, a password-based symmetric encryption and authentication solutions are added in the distance vector exchange protocol to defend against masquerade attacks. In the key agreement phase, nodes and neighbor nodes generate a key set of common for communication through their respective key. Beacon node authentication is in communication process of encryption and transmission. Because initial key is distributed randomly, even if an attacker hijack a part of the node, it still cannot infer the key the rest of keys between nodes; Second, for attacks against the wormhole attack and blocking the safe handling, an average hop-based distance estimation algorithm is introduced. The appropriate distance value for each hop is selected by judging and comparing hop distance. And an effective jump distance is obtained by using the weighted average method .So it can avoid errors caused by wormhole attacks. Simulation experiments on Matlab simulation platform show that the security algorithm not only has high accuracy but also can effectively prevent and resist external attack, so the new algorithm has high security. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

Then, the residual errors of the pending pixel with respect to each atom are evaluated and considered as the criteria for classification, namely, the ultimate class can be obtained according to the atoms with the least residual error.

Internet of Things (ITs) consists of large semantic nodes which can be used in many new producing fields like community. In this paper, a Hierarchy based reasoning semantic standard has been proposed for community fields. So it is important in the first place to avoid learning as much as possible and in cases when learning escaping is not possible, to control the learning. The proposed standard which is called ENDE avoids learning in the first step using multi-way. We discriminate between observant, non-observant and control communication, and service the input communication based on their importance and quality of service requirements. In cases where input communication rate increases and learning cannot be avoided, it relieves learning by using a best learning control method. The proposed AQS method uses single assumed rank's condition on a single practical rank to accept or drop the imputing packages. The performance of ENDE was assessed using the imitation semantic system. Imitation results indicated that ENDE achieves its goals. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

However, with DC transmission access, the power system must have a strong ability of reactive power support to cope with the possibility of transient voltage problem. At the same time, regional power oscillation issue also can't be ignored. Considering that the STATCOM device, as a type of parallel FACTS, can only provide dynamic reactive power to support the system voltage and cannot undertake active regulation and control to damp system power oscillation problem, STATCOM with energy storage is presented in this paper to solve both problem of transient voltage and power oscillation in AC-DC hybrid system. In view of the central China province power grid planning, possible serious faults of the system were analyzed.

HAPS is envisaged to be a novel technology for communication, broadcasting, internet backbone, earth observation and surveillance, and also for navigation. One of upcoming technologies for communication is a long term term evolution (LTE) of a cellular forth generation (4G). Many techniques have been developed to make LTE come into real in the environment of cellular terrestrial. However, LTE that deployed through HAPS is a challenging due to different its geometry and channel. This paper aims at evaluating the performance of a pilot-based channel estimation for uplink LTE using SC-FDMA over Ricean HAPS communication channel. Pilot-based channel estimation is used to estimate an uplink channel of LTE users who transmit the data to HAPS as a base transceiver station (BTS). Analysis is performed to determine the effect of user's elevation angle with respect to user position inside HAPS coverage, LTE channel bandwidth, modulation type, and the Doppler frequency shift effect. We found that user's elevation angle contribute major effect to the pilot-based channel estimation of LTE SC-FDMA performance. System capability to overcome fading effect that users with low elevation angle would be needed to increase the performance. In particular to keep an acceptable performance, in this paper we compensate the channel bandwidth, changing modulation type, and limit the Doppler Effect through vehicle speed limitation. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","High altitude platforms; Long term evolution; Pilot-based channel estimation; Ricean fading channel; SC-FDMA","Acoustic bulk wave devices; Bandwidth; Channel coding; Channel estimation; Doppler effect; Fading channels; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Modulation; Network security; Radio transceivers; Wireless telecommunication systems; Acceptable performance; Base transceiver station; Doppler frequency shift; High altitude platform; High altitude platform systems; Ricean fading channel; SC-FDMA; Wireless technologies; Frequency division multiple access","Iskandar; School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Bandung Institute of Technology, Jalan Ganesha No. 10, India; email: iskandar@stei.itb.ac.id",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Energy production process in the digester is however sometimes hard to be monitored due to manual measurement, otherwise it needs a high technology requiring a high cost budget. This paper presents a low cost technology to monitor the process by using Android based smart phones which can easily be integrated in human daily activity. A program was built by using Eclipse in order to give send/receive command to/from the hardware and display the measurement data on the registered smart phones. The measurement controller was put at the anaerobic digester to record temperature and Relative Humidity (RH) data to memory card and to transmit the data to smart phones. In the experiment with 20 data samples, mean errors were repectively -0.317 oC, 0.932 oC, and 1,378 % for temperature sensor LM35, and temperature and RH sensor using SHT11. Mean squared error for LM35 was 0.373 oC and for SHT11 was 1.117 oC and 2.629 % for temperature and RH respectively. The system has been also implemented in the real anaerobic digester.

Present AP localization systems are working on specially designed Wi-Fi units, and their algorithms using radio signal strength (RSS) exhibit (relatively) high errors, so industry looks more precise and fast adaptable methods. A new model considering/eliminating strong RSS levels in addition to close distance error elimination algorithm (CDEEA) combined with median filters has been proposed in order to increase the performance of conventional RSS based location systems. Collecting local signal strengths by means of an ordinary WiFi units present on any laptop as a receiver is followed by the application of CDEEA to eliminate strong RSS levels. Median filter is then applied to those eliminated values, and AP based path loss model is generated, adaptivelly. Finally, the proposed algorithm predicts locations within a maximum mean error of 2.96m for 90% precision level.

In the process of appearance quality inspection of lens module, it is a problem that the inspection accuracy depends mainly on manual workers. To save the time and amount of this quality detection labor, it's necessary for us to design the lens module's appearance quality automatic inspection system. This paper proposes a subpixel-accurate edge detection algorithm based on wavelet transform with the cubic spline interpolation for the lens module's appearance quality inspection system. Firstly, calculate the wavelet modulus maximum, and detect a pixel-accurate edge. Then apply the cubic spline interpolation to obtain subpixel-accurate edge at the side of the pixel-accurate edge. Finally, an industrial measurement method using this subpixel-accurate edge detection algorithm is studied, and some experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the lens module's appearance quality inspection system.

Consequently, interference alignment (IA) as an effective interference management approach has been implemented to D2D communications for the frequency sharing. However, the measurement of channel state information (CSI) between transmitter and receiver of a D2D pair and cross-channel state information (C-CSI) among D2D pairs are the major issues that need to be resolved for the implementation of IA from theory to practical. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an effective D2D discovery scheme to overcome this problem, which can measure the CSI and C-CSI based on the discovery messages. Simulation results show that, under perfect conditions, even though the proposed D2D discovery scheme increases the needed time slots to establish D2D communications by 6.2% compared with the conventional D2D discovery without considering IA, it increases the throughput up to 50% than the conventional D2D without considering IA, i.e., it improves the spectrum efficiency. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Channel state information; D2D; D2D discovery; Interference alignment","Cochannel interference; Frequency bands; Channel measurements; D2D communications; D2D discovery; Frequency sharing; Interference alignment; Interference management; Spectrum efficiency; Transmitter and receiver; Channel state information","Li, Y.; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Mobile Communication Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (CQUPT)China; email: liyunpeng229@163.com",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Also the control delay of the algorithm is compensated. Finally, simulation experiments of three-level AFE converter under steady-state and dynamic conditions are provided.

Recently, a new method named compressed sensing (CS) has been proposed to estimate sparse channel, which greatly improves the spectrum efficiency. However, it is difficult to realize it due to its high computational complexity. Although the proposed Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) can reduce the complexity of CS, the efficiency of OMP is still low because only one index is identified per iteration. Therefore, to solve this problem, more efficient schemes are proposed. At first, we apply Generalized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (GOMP) to channel estimation, which lower computational complexity by selecting multiple indices in each iteration. Then a more effective scheme that selects indices by least squares (LS) method is proposed to significantly reduce the computational complexity, which is a modified method of GOMP. Simulation results and theoretical analysis show the effectivity of the proposed algorithms. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

The problem in robot navigation is that a robot has incapability of finding the shortest path while moving to the goal position and avoiding obstacles. Hence, a modification of several algorithms is proposed to enable the robot to reach the goal position through the shortest path. The algorithms used are fuzzy logic and cell decomposition algorithms, in which the fuzzy algorithm which is an artificial intelligence algorithm is used for robot path planning and cell decomposition algorithm is used to create a map for the robot path, but the merger of these two algorithms is still incapable of finding the shortest path. Therefore, this paper describes a modification of the both algorithms by adding potential field algorithm that is used to provide weight values on the map in order for the quadrotor to move to its goal position and find the shortest path.

The graph based DNA sequence assembly, that is used to handle these big data in assembly step, is very sensitive to DNA sequencing errors. This problem can be solved by performing an error correction step before the assembly process. This research proposed fuzzy inference system based spectral alignment method which can detect and correct DNA sequencing errors. The spectral alignment method was implemented as a pre-processing step before the DNA sequence assembly process. The evaluation was conducted using Velvet assembler. the total nodes yielded by the Velvet assembler become a measure of the success of error correction. The results showed that the fuzzybased spectral alignment method generated small total nodes for k = 53. It was concluded that the fuzzybased spectral alignment method is successfully able to detect and correct DNA sequencing errors. © 2016.","DNA sequencing errors; Fuzzy inference system model; Next generation sequencing; Spectral alignment method","Alignment; Assembly; Big data; DNA; Error correction; Errors; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Gene encoding; Graphic methods; Silk; Alignment methods; Assembly process; DNA sequence assembly; DNA Sequencing; Fuzzy inference systems; Next generation sequencers; Next-generation sequencing; Pre-processing step; DNA sequences","Kusuma, W.A.; Bioinformatics Research Group, Bogor Agricultural University, Department of Computer Science, Jl.

Clustering mechanism divides the WSN into different sub-regions called clusters. Individual cluster is consisting of cluster head (CH) and member nodes. The main research challenges behind clustering mechanism are to optimize network overheads with efficient data delivery. Sensor nodes are operated by batteries and practically it is not feasible to replace them during sensing the environment so energy should be effectively utilized among sensors for improving overall network performance. This research paper presents an improved energy aware cluster based data routing (i-ECBR) scheme, by dividing the network regions into uniform sized square partitions and localized CH election mechanism.

This radar network was developed for surveillance at the Sunda strait. The radar network monitors the sea traffics and activities at the Sunda strait, which an international shipping route. There were three radars installed for this network. All these radars in this research use FMCW (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) technology. This FMCW has an advantage of low power consumption, low cost of operational, longer life time and high reliability. Another important feature of this radar is the LPI (Low Probability of Intercept) capability, where the signal transmission of this radar cannot be easily detected by a radar detector (Electronic Support Measure) so that this radar can be used for a covert operation. Detected targets by radars are shown on the display and on the web based display for the radar network. These three radars on the remote sites can be monitored and controlled via an internet connection from the control room in our Bandung office, which is 300 KMs away. The results of this research and development show the Indonesian capability to build a complex system such as a chain of coastal surveillance radar network.

As is the case in many countries, Iraq is home to a collection of remote villages. Since it is uneconomical to connect these villages to the existing grid, the installation of standalone electrical power generators has become common practice. As a result, diesel stand-alone power generators see widespread use in these remote locales, which, whilst fit for their intended purpose, unfortunately suffer from several drawbacks, including instability in regards to everyday oil prices and a number of environmental issues. The implementation of a PV/FC hybrid power system could be one potential alternative to help solve these problems. Therefore, this paper will present PV/FC system control strategies alongside information relating to the performance of such system components, based on a case study that was conducted in Al-Gowair, Iraq. This study is especially important in terms of envisioning the future energy supply needs of Iraq. The HOMER simulation results showed that by using the proposed control strategies and suggested components of a PV/FC system, it was able to produce a satisfactory outcome. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Diesel generator; Fuel cells; Hybrid power system.; photovoltaic; Remote area.","Fuel cells; Hybrid systems; Rural areas; Diesel generators; Electrical energy supply; Electrical power generators; Environmental issues; Hybrid power systems; Performance analysis; Photovoltaic; Remote areas; Energy resources","Sidik, M.A.B.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universitas SriwijayaIndonesia",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

The high electric field generated due to the ultra high voltage causes the increase and reduction in the size of the plants. Numerous research has been carried out to investigate the effect of electric field on the plants. However, the knowledge in term of quantitative analysis on the effect of electric field on the growth of vegetables is not entirely understood. Thus, this paper presents a study conducted to investigate the effect of high voltage DC electric fields on the young vegetable growth namely 'Choy Sam' and bean sprout. The experimental setup was designed which composed of two parallel plate electrodes. An electric field intensity of 38 kV/m was supplied between those two plate electrodes, and it was applied to the young vegetables. This research was focused on the percentage of germination and growing rate of young vegetables. The experiment was divided into two parts. The first part was to test whether there was an effect towards young vegetables exposed to or not exposed to electric fields. The second part of the experiment was to test the effect of electric fields treated water towards young vegetables. The numbers of seed, temperature and relative humidity were controlled. The changing of vegetables was observed for 8 hours per day for two weeks (Choy Sam) and one week (bean sprout). The growth of the young vegetables during exposure was calculated by using statistical methods. The analysis of the results showed that the electric fields and the electric fields treated water have influenced the germination rate and height of stems of both young vegetables causing the increase in stem height. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

The method used to select sentences from the source document would determine the quality of the summary result. One of the most popular methods used in weighting sentences was by calculating the frequency of occurrence of words forming the sentences. However, choosing sentences with that method could lead to a chosen sentence which didn't represent the content of the source document optimally. This was because the weighting of sentences was only measured by using the number of occurrences of words. This study proposed a new strategy of weighting sentences based on sentences distribution to choose the most important sentences which paid much attention to the elements of sentences that were formed as a distribution of words. This method of sentence distribution enables the extraction of an important sentence in multi-document summarization which served as a strategy to improve the quality of sentence summaries. In that respect were three concepts used in this study: (1) clustering sentences with similarity based histogram clustering, (2) ordering cluster by cluster importance and (3) selection of important sentence by sentence distribution. Results of experiments showed that the proposed method had a better performance when compared with SIDeKiCK and LIGI methods. Results of ROUGE-1 showed the proposed method increasing 3% compared with the SIDeKiCK method and increasing 5.1% compared with LIGI method.

However some problems i.e the inability to discover OR, noise and event log incompleteness are emmerged while determining right model of business process. First, OR relation is often discovered as AND relation. Second, noise problem is occured when there are truncated and low frequency traces in event log. Thus control-flow pattern is used to solve issues of same noise relation frequency hence it discovers relation based on transaction function of activity. Consequently, it can refine non noise relation in business process model. Third, incompleteness leads to incorrect discovery of parallel process model; therefore we used Timed-based Process Mining which utilized non-linear dependence to solve the incompleteness. Finally this paper proposed combination of Timed-based Process Mining and control-flow pattern to discover OR and handle same frequency noise and incompleteness.

As the high performance computing devices are increasingly common, more and more modern commodity machines have the capability of parallel concurrent computing. A new implementation of sorting algorithms is proposed to harness the power of newer SIMD operations and multi-core computing provided by modern CPUs. The algorithm is hybrid by optimized bitonic sorting network and multi-way merge. New SIMD instructions provided by modern CPUs are used in the bitonic network implementation, which adopted a different method to arrange data so that the number of SIMD operations is reduced. Balanced binary trees are used in multi-way merge, which is also different with former implementations. Efforts are also paid on minimizing data moving in memory since merge sort is a kind of memory-bound application. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm is twice as fast as the sort function in C++ standard library when only single thread is used. It also outperforms radix sort implemented in Boost library. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","AVX; Bitonic network; Merge sort; SIMD","Binary trees; Program processors; Sorting; Balanced binary tree; Bitonic networks; Concurrent computing; High performance computing; Memory-bound applications; Multi-core computing; SIMD; Standard libraries; Algorithms","Xu, M.; Computer School of Wuhan UniversityChina; email: xuming@whu.edu.cn",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

By default, the systems use the signal-timing plans to control the vehicle flow. To accommodate the traffic variations, a new method of vehicle detection has been built. The method calculated an intensity histogram standard deviation of the image representing a detection area to determine traffic density of each intersection lane.

The tested area is designed to represent most common environment in which LTE will be deployed. We use 30 MHz frequency bandwidth in the simulation to evaluate intra-band and interband CA technique performance. Two CCs is allocated for primary serving cell (PCell) and secondary serving cell (SCell). Simulation result shows for the downlink, BLER tend to increase, as the frequency configuration is increase. However, for the uplink BLER is zero. We found that for CA configuration with wider PCell bandwidth resulting better throughput. In CA intra-band, the throughput of non-contiguous CA is better than CA contiguous.

It has has become an important issue for various remotes sensing (RS) problems such as land classification, change detection, object identification, image segmentation, map updating, hazard monitoring, and visualization purposes. When applied to remote sensing images, a common problem associated with existing fusion methods has been the color distortion, or degradation in the spectral quality. The main proposed of this research is to evaluate the quality of fused images for object identification. We examine the effectiveness of the following techniques multiresolution analysis (MRA) and component substitution (CS) fusion. In order to improve this situation, the second purpose of this work is to establish an automatic and reliable way for the evaluation of the fused images, on the basis of both qualitative and quantitative metrics. In this result, It is found that the CS fusion method provides better performance than the MRA scheme. Quantitative analysis shows that the CSbased method gives a better result in terms of spatial quality (sharpness), whereas the MRA-based method yields better spectral quality, i.e., better color fidelity to the original MS images. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Fast Fourier transform (FFT)-enhanced IHS (FFT-E); Image fusion; Multispectral; Object identification; Panchromatic","Fast Fourier transforms; Hazards; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Image resolution; Image segmentation; Object detection; Quality control; Remote sensing; Component substitution; High spatial resolution; Multi-spectral; Object identification; Panchromatic; Panchromatic (Pan) image; Remote sensing applications; Remote sensing images; Image fusion","Yuhendra; Department of Informatics, Faculty of Engineering, Padang Institute of TechnologyIndonesia; email: yuhendrasan@gmail.com",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Thus it has been proven stabler for VANETs than conventional routing. However, the frequently changed topology and nodes density could break the path a packet is following. Thus designing a robust multi-hop routing in VANET is challenging.

In case of network parameters hop length between nodes can be derived without complicated computation and further optimized using Kalman filtering in which guarantees robustness even in complicated environment with random node communication range. Especially sensor fusion techniques used has well gained robustness, accuracy, scalability, and power efficiency even without accurate distance or angle measurement which is more suitable in nonlinear conditions and power limited WSNs environment.

This checking algorithm can determine the maximum power first before the P &amp; O algorithm takes place to identify the voltage at MPP (VMPP), which is needed to calculate the duty cycle for the boost converter. To test the effectiveness of the algorithm, a simulation model of PV system has been carried out using MATLAB/Simulink under different level of irradiation; or in other words partially shaded condition of PV array. The results from the system using the proposed approach prove to have faster response and low ripple. Besides, the results are close to the desired outputs and exhibit an approximately 98.25% of the system efficiency.

However, it is easy to fall into local optimal solution, which leads to poor classification. In order to improve the accuracy of classification, this paper, based on the improved marked watershed segmentation, puts forward a fuzzy c-means clustering optimization algorithm. Because the watershed segmentation and fuzzy c-means clustering are sensitive to the noise of the image, this paper uses the adaptive median filtering algorithm to eliminate the noise information. During this process, the classification numbers and initial cluster centers of fuzzy c-means are determined by the result of the fuzzy similar relation clustering. Through a series of comparative simulation experiments, the results show that the method proposed in this paper is more accurate than the ISODATA method, and it is a feasible training method. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Adaptive median filtering; Fuzzy C-Means clustering; Fuzzy similarity relation; Marked watershed segmentation","Adaptive filters; Copying; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy systems; Image classification; Image reconstruction; Image segmentation; Information filtering; Median filters; Optimization; Remote sensing; Accuracy of classifications; Adaptive median filtering; Fuzzy C means clustering; Fuzzy C-means algorithms; Fuzzy similarity relation; Remote sensing image classification; Watershed segmentation; Watershed transformations; Clustering algorithms","Zhao, C.; School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hebei University of TechnologyChina; email: 36872763@qq.com",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

In this research, we found the critical condition of Cu defficient in CIAS by preparing and analyzing the CIAS thin film absorbers. The thin film precursors were tailored using PLD system with a certain stacking order of layer-by-layer elemental film deposition and then selenized via a solid state reaction to form CIAS phases.

The results show that CIAS thin film absorber in Cu-deficient condition still can be performed in single phase structure until 18 at.% of Cu/CIAS with high band gap energy, high charge carrier concentration, and good morphology.

Most of network flows are short and carry very few packets, and the number of large flows is small. Traditional random sampling tends to sample more large flows than short ones. However, many applications depend on per-flow traffic other than just large flows. A flow fair sampling based on multistage Bloom filters is proposed. The total measurement interval is divided into n child time intervals. In each child time interval, employ multistage Bloom filters to query the incoming packet's flow whether exists in flow information table or not. If exists, sample the packet with static sampling rate which is inversely proportional to the estimation flow traffic up to the previous time interval; if not, that is it's a new flow's first packet, create the flow information, insert it into the multistage Bloom filters and sample the packet with 100% probability.

Consequently, Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcasting (DTMB) is one of the digital television standards that is currently used by China and Hong Kong. DTMB standard consists of various configuration parameters that can be chosen for different applications. Therefore, DTMB system was designed in this research based on standard GB20600-2006 and was validated using computer program named Simulink. The parameters used for the design were FEC with code rate of 0.4, 4QAM mapping, interleaving mode 1 and single carrier mode. Those parameters were chosen based on low implementation complexity thus generates good results. The input for DTMB system was MPEG-2 audio and video Transport Stream (TS) structure. DTMB system consists of two important things such as the existence of FEC and TDS-OFDM. DTMB system uses concatenated codes in FEC. They are BCH as the outer codec and LDPC as the inner codec. DTMB system uses TDS-OFDM because it provides better picture quality when the receiver is in motion. Simulation results shows that DTMB is able to receive video with identical quality compared to the original video when the value of SNR=11 dB for static video and SNR=12 dB for dynamic video. It is shown that the number of bit errors decrease as the value of SNR increase when the process passes from LDPC to BCH. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Broadcasting; Digital TV; DTMB; Simulation; Simulink","Broadcasting; Concatenated codes; Digital television; Forward error correction; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Television broadcasting; Television standards; Television systems; Configuration parameters; Digital TV; DTMB; Implementation complexity; Multimedia broadcasting; Performance analysis; Simulation; Simulink; Digital multimedia broadcasting","Haryatmi, E.; Universitas Gunadarma, Jl.

The experiment result of benchmark function shows that the method of this paper can maintain solution diversity, effectively avoid premature convergence and enhance the global search ability of DE algorithm. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Adaptive crossover; Adaptive mutation; Differential evolution; Niche algorithm","Bioinformatics; Biology; Health; Optimization; Adaptive crossovers; Adaptive mutation; Crossover and mutation probabilities; Differential Evolution; Differential evolution algorithms; Local optimal solution; Pre-mature convergences; Random search algorithm; Evolutionary algorithms","Wang, H.; Electron and Information Department, Zhenjiang CollegeChina; email: fl@dnzs.net.cn",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

In order to handle the problem of scalable nodes deployment, we therefore, propose a dynamic nodes deployment algorithm where every node in the network is assigned a location in the quick and efficient way without needing any localization scheme. It provides an option to handle the heterogeneous types of nodes, distribute topology and mechanism in which new nodes are easily added to the network without affecting the existing network performance.

The micro-actuator device consists of an NdFeB permanent magnet, thin silicon membrane and planar micro-coil which fabricated using simple standard MEMS techniques with additional bonding step. Two planar coils designs including planar parallel and spiral coil structure with various coil geometry are chosen for the study. Analysis of the device involves the investigation of electromagnetic and mechanical properties using finite element analysis (FEA), the measurement of the membrane deflection and functionality test. The measurement results show that the thin silicon membrane is able to deform as much as 12.87 μm using planar spiral micro-coil. Reasonable match between simulation and measurement of about 82.5% has been revealed. The dynamic response test on actuator driven by parallel planar coil shows that silicon membrane effectively deformed in 40 s for an input electrical power of only 150 mW. It is also concluded that planar parallel coil is considered for the simple structure and easy fabrication of the actuator system.

CS theory certifies that signals can be recovered from fewer samples than Nyquist rate. On this paper, the compressive sensing technique is applied for data compression on our weather monitoring system. On this weather monitoring system, compression using compressive sensing with fewer samples or measurements means minimizing sensing and overall energy cost. Our focus on this paper lies in the selection of matrix for representation basis under which the weather data are sparsely represented.

Musical genres are the main top-level descriptors used to organize digital music files. Most of work in labeling genre done manually. Thus, an automatic way for labeling a genre to digital music files is needed. The most standard approach to do automatic musical genre classification is feature extraction followed by supervised machine-learning. This research aims to find the best combination of audio features using several kernels of non-linear Support Vector Machines (SVM). The 31 different combinations of proposed audio features are dissimilar compared in any other related research. Furthermore, among the proposed audio features, Linear Predictive Coefficients (LPC) has not been used in another works related to musical genre classification. LPC was originally used for speech coding. An experimentation in classifying digital music file into a genre is carried out. The experiments are done by extracting feature sets related to timbre, rhythm, tonality and LPC from music files. All possible combination of the extracted features are classified using three different kernel of SVM classifier that are Radial Basis Function (RBF), polynomial and sigmoid. The result shows that the most appropriate kernel for automatic musical genre classification is polynomial kernel and the best combination of audio features is the combination of musical surface, Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC), tonality and LPC. It achieves 76.6 % in classification accuracy. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Audio Features; Linear Predictive Coefficients; Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients; Support Vector Machine","Artificial intelligence; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Radial basis function networks; Speech recognition; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Audio features; Classification accuracy; Linear predictive coefficients; Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients; Music information retrieval; Musical genre classification; Radial Basis Function(RBF); Supervised machine learning; Audio acoustics","Mutiara, A.B.; Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Gunadarma UniversityIndonesia; email: amutiara@staff.gunadarma.ac.id",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

In the past, a wide range of learning methods and features has been proposed for this task. We provide a systematic comparison of the performance of these learning methods and features in terms of prediction accuracy and feature importance. Specifically, from each previously published approach we take the best performing features and group these into two sets: user features and tweet features. In addition, we contrast five learning methods, both linear and non-linear. On top of that, we examine the added value of a previously proposed time-sensitive modeling approach. To the authors' knowledge this is the first attempt to collect best performing features and contrast linear and non-linear learning methods. We perform our comparisons on a single dataset and find that user features such as the number of times a user is listed, number of followers, and average number of tweets published per day most strongly contribute to prediction accuracy across selected learning methods. We also find that a random forest-based learning, which has not been employed in previous studies, achieves the highest performance among the learning methods we consider. We also find that on top of properly tuned learning methods the benefits of time-sensitive modeling are very limited. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Machine learning algorithms; Performance; Retweet prediction","Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Forecasting; Learning systems; Average numbers; Learning methods; Model approach; Nonlinear learning; Performance; Prediction accuracy; Prediction tasks; Random forests; Learning algorithms","Bunyamin, H.; Department of Informatics, Maranatha Christian University, Jl.

Therefore, the primary aim of this paper was to design a control system to maximize output efficiency during a normal operation by maintaining the heater/absorber temperature at the highest safe operating point and preventing excessive range of threshold to prevent damage to the heater material. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Concentrating Solar Power (CSP); Control systems; Heater; Highest safe operating point; Parabolic dish stirling engine system","Control systems; Efficiency; Solar energy; Stirling engines; Concentrating solar power; Engine systems; Heater; High thermal; Normal operations; Operating points; Parabolic dishes; Working gas; Engines","Ab Ghani, M.R.; Faculty of Electrical Enginering, Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM)Malaysia; email: dpdruddin@utem.edu.my",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Therefore, the feature extraction plays a significant role in biometrics computational. In this research, a novel approach to extract the features is proposed for facial image recognition. Four criteria of the Discriminant Analysis have been modeled to find the dominant features. For each criterion is an objective function, it was derived to obtain the optimum values. The optimum values can be solved by using generalized the Eigenvalue problem associated to the largest Eigenvalue. The modeling results were employed to recognize the facial image by the multi-criteria projection to the original data. The training sets were also processed by using the Eigenface projection to avoid the singularity problem cases.

Overlay networks with multipath transmission is the promising solution to address the above problems. But in wireless networks the maintenance of overlay networks induce additional overheads affecting the bulky and delay sensitive delivery of multimedia data. To minimize the overheads, this work introduces the Error Compensated Data Distribution Model (ECDD) that aids in reducing end to end delays and overheads arising from packet retransmissions. The ECDD adopts mTreebone algorithm to identify the unstable wireless nodes and construct overlay tree. The overlay tree is further split to support multipath transmissions. A sub packetization mechanism is adopted for multipath video data delivery in the ECDD. A forward error correction mechanism and sub-packet retransmission techniques adopted in ECDD enables to reduce the overhead and end to end delay. The simulation results presented in this paper prove that the ECDD model proposed achieves lower end to end delay and outperforms the existing models in place.

In such DSRC-based vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication systems, because of the extremely time-varying characteristic of wireless propagation channels, accurate channel estimation is essential for reliable information exchange between vehicles. In this paper, the characteristics of the propagation channel and several traditional channel estimation schemes for V2V communications are reviewed. Then, a delay-based channel-frequency-response decomposition scheme is proposed to estimate and predict the double-selective V2V channel while adhering to the IEEE 802.11p standard. The proposed method achieves a more favorable performance than the traditional methods in V2V scenarios by combining the least square estimation in the frequency domain with the linear prediction in time domain. The performance advantages of the proposed scheme are verified by the simulation results from three typical scenarios.

However, the FMEA method has several flaws; for example, the non-differential analysis of evaluation index and the impossibility of evaluating the actual risk among risk priority number (RPN) values that on the surface are equal.

To settle these deficiencies, this paper has proposed an adaptive chaos particle swarm optimization (ACPSO) based on the idea of chaos optimization after analyzing the basic principles of PSO.

Moreover, since sensor nodes have restricted transmission range, multiple hops are needed by the node in order to forward the packets from one node to the other and this raises very challenging issues when designing routing protocols. Most of the proposed single path routing schemes use a periodic low-rate flooding of data in order to recover from path failures, which causes higher consumption in sensor node resources. So multipath routing is an optimal approach to enhance the network lifetime. In this paper, a robust path construction for a reliable data transmission in node-disjoint multipath routing (RNDMR) is proposed for WSNs. The proposed RNDMR has the ability to provide a low overhead path construction as well as provide data transmission reliability by using XORbased coding algorithm, which entails low utilization of resources, such as low storage space and lesser computing power. In the proposed RNDMR, the procedure involves the splitting up of all transmitted messages into many different segments of equal size, before adding the XOR-based error correction codes and distributing it among multiple paths simultaneously in order to boost reliable data transmission and to be assured that the essential fragment of the packet arrives at the sink node without any additional consumption of energy and undue delay. By using simulations, the performance of RNDMR was assessed and compares it with ReInForm routing. The results illustrate that RNDMR attains low energy consumption, records low average delay and routing overhead, as well as increased packet delivery ratio when compared with ReInForm Routing. © 2015 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Forward error correction; Node-disjoint multipath routing; Reliability; Robust path construction; Wireless sensor network","Data communication systems; Data transfer; Digital storage; Electric power transmission; Energy utilization; Error correction; Forward error correction; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Reliability; Routing protocols; Telecommunication networks; Wireless sensor networks; Consumption of energy; Error correction codes; Low energy consumption; Node-disjoint multipath routing; Path construction; Reliable data transmission; Utilization of resources; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes","Almazroi, A.A.; Department of Computer sciences, Faculty of Computing, Universiti Technologi MalaysiaMalaysia; email: maaaal2@live.utm.my",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

The pornographic image recognition is defined as a process to classify the image containing and showing genital elements of human body from any kinds of images. This process is hard to be performed because the images have large variability due to poses, lighting, and background variations. The skin probability and holistic feature, which is extracted by YCbCr skin segmentation and PCA, is employed to handle those variability problems. The function of skin segmentation is to determine skin Region of Interest (ROI) image and skin probability. While the function of PCA is to extract eigenporn of the skin ROIs images and to project the skin ROI vector using the obtained eigenporns to holistic features. The main aim of this research is to optimize the accuracy and false rejection rate of the skin probability and fusion descriptor based recognition system. The experimental result shows that the proposed method can increase the accuracy by about 4.0% and decreases the FPR 20.6% of those of pornographic recognition using fusion descriptors, respectively.

Thus, the alignment algorithm needs to be parallelized to be able to align them in a shorter time. Many previous researches have parallelized PA algorithm using various data partitioning schema, but it is unknown which one is the best. The data partitioning schema is important for parallel PA performance, because this algorithm uses dynamic programming technique that needs intense inter-thread communication. In this paper, we compared four partitioning schemas to find the best performing one on shared memory system. Those schemas are: blocked columnwise, rowwise, antidiagonal, and blocked columnwise with manual scheduling and loop unrolling. The testing is done on quad-core processor using DNA sequence of 1000 to 16000 bp as the input. The blocked columnwise with manual scheduling and loop unrolling schema gave the best performance of 89% efficiency.

Multiplexed Binary Offset Carrier (MBOC) is the final implementation of Galileo E1 and GPS L1C, which is the multiplexing of BOC (1,1) and BOC (6,1). Therefore, it is helpful to satisfy the demand that the new signals must be compatible with GPS BPSK signal. BOC (kn,n) modulation will provide better track performance and higher positioning accuracy. However, the main drawback of the BOC modulated signal is that its autocorrelation has multiple side peaks around the main peak. This paper will focus on a family of signals: sine-phased BOC (kn,n). We are trying to explore a new method to cancel the side peaks of BOC (kn,n) autocorrelation, making use of two kinds of correlation functions. One is the correlation of the incoming signal and the sine-phased BOC (kn,n) modulated spreading code(PRN code multiplied by subcarrier), and the other is the correlation of the incoming signal and the PRN code only. Two kinds of correlation function are separated into several sub-correlations. Sub-correlations have less side peaks which are in different code delays. Corresponding parts of two sub-correlations will be combined to cancel the side peaks separately, and finally the new function without side peaks will be acquired after several correlations added together. Simulation results will be given. It is shown that the proposed method is contributed to the side peaks cancellation for unambiguous sine-phased BOC (kn, n) signal acquisition.","Combined correlation functions; Sine-Phased BOC (kn,n) signal; Unambiguous acquisition","Autocorrelation; Codes (symbols); Mergers and acquisitions; Signal analysis; Binary offset carriers; Correlation function; Modulated signal; Positioning accuracy; Signal acquisitions; Spreading codes; Sub correlations; Unambiguous acquisition; Signal processing","Yue, X.; Beijing University of Posts and TelecommunicationsChina",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

There are some components that affect the effectiveness of LPS. One of the components is the lightning air terminal. With reference to the facilities requiring lightning protection the position, the apparent height, and the angle of protection of lightning air terminals determines the collection volume (CV) of the protected area. The CV of direct strike lightning air terminals can change because of the facility is affected by natural disasters such as seismic tremor and flood. If such natural disasters do happen, there are possibilities that the facilities will not be fully protected from direct lightning strikes. The building and structure could be misalignment after the seismic tremor and flood related to earth movement. So for the safety of equipment and personnel, lightning protection system efficacy assurance is necessary. Therefore, there should be a technique and device to monitor the variation of collection volume afforded by every lightning air terminal on buildings and structures after the occurrence of a natural disaster. This paper presents a new technique as well as a new device to monitor the collection volume variation. A part of the device was obtained from a recycled moveable television antenna. This approach is not only practical, portable and cost effective but also incorporating the idea of environmental protection and recycling of used plastic materials.","Collection volume; Flood; Lightning; Lightning protection system; Seismic","Conservation; Cost effectiveness; Disasters; Environmental protection; Floods; Lightning protection; Recycling; Seismology; Television antennas; Direct lightning strikes; Fully protected; Lightning air terminal; Lightning protection systems; Natural disasters; Plastic materials; Seismic; Volume variation; Lightning","Ahmad, H.; Institute of High Voltage and High Current (IVAT), Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MalaysiaMalaysia",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

However, the implementation in tropical area faces transmission problems which degrade signal reception, such as heavy rain. This paper examines the performance of heterogenous traffics in LMDS in a rainy environment. Some techniques to tackle rain ploblems were implemented and the effects were assesed. It was proven that PHY and MAC layers contribute to performances enhancement on rainy environment as long as the system uses the suitable scheduler. A packet-based scheduler was proposed by considering packet impact on quality.

The level of safety when driving can be improved by reducing driver (human) error. An auxiliary device is required by the driver to avoid an accident. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs) are systems designed to help the driver in the driving process. The Overtaking Assistance System (OAS) is a subsystem of an ADAS that functions by assisting the driver in the overtaking process. This paper presents a decision-making system based on fuzzy logic for the OAS. The inputs in a decision-making system are the distance of the ego vehicle and the vehicle that will be overtaken as well as the distance of the ego vehicle and the vehicle in the other lane. The decisions involved in a decision-making system concern the vehicle performing the approaching, tailgating, and overtaking. The results from hardware simulation using a remote control car show that the decision-making system algorithm can work according to the design.","Advanced driver assistance system; Fuzzy logic; Overtaking assistant system; Overtaking decision making","Automobile drivers; Data storage equipment; Decision making; Design; Fuzzy logic; Remote control; Vehicle performance; Vehicles; Assistance system; Auxiliary device; Decision-making systems; Hardware simulation; Level of safeties; Overtaking assistant system; Advanced driver assistance systems","Basjaruddin, N.C.; School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Bandung Institute of Technology, Jl.

Despite significant advantages and tremendous applications, WSN is vulnerable to variety of attacks. Due to resource constraint nature of WSN, applicability of traditional security solutions is debatable. Although cryptography, authentication and confidentiality measures help in preventing specific types of attacks but they cannot safeguard against node misbehavior attacks and come at significant cost. To address this problem, we propose a Trust Based Secure Routing Protocol (TBSRP) which relies on distributed trust model for the detection and isolation of misbehaving nodes. The TBSRP aims to establish shortest path that contain all trusted nodes, identify packet forwarding misbehavior caused by malicious and faulty nodes and reroute the traffic to other reliable paths. The performance of TBSRP is evaluated in terms of packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay and normalized routing load. Simulations results show that TBSRP can achieve both high delivery ratio and throughput in presence of various numbers of misbehaving and faulty nodes.","Faulty nodes; Node misbehavior; Security; Trust; Wireless sensor networks","Routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks; Average end-to-end delays; Distributed Trust Model; Faulty node; Node misbehavior; Normalized routing loads; Security; Trust; Trust-based Secure Routing; Sensor nodes",,,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

In the image registration, because of the problems that the image information is complicated, they have strong correlation and incompleteness, inaccuracy and non-construction occur in different levels in the processing, to apply the method of computational intelligence information processing in the image registration can have better results than the traditional computation methods. This paper proposes an image registration method based on wavelet decomposition and ant colony optimization, which divides the process of image registration into coarse registration and refined registration through wavelet decomposition technique. In the coarse registration, the transformation parameter value of the image approximation component is acquired through ant colony optimization while the changing parameter value of the original image is obtained by the ant colony search method in the refined registration. The simulation experiment shows that this registration method has the characteristics of anti-noise, fast speed, high accuracy and high registration success rate.","Ant colony optimization; Image registration; Wavelet transform","Algorithms; Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Image processing; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; Changing parameter; Coarse registration; Computation methods; Decomposition technique; Registration methods; Shooting conditions; Strong correlation; Transformation parameters; Image registration","Li, J.; Educational Administration Department, Henan Vocational and Technical InstituteChina",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

The system states will be updated by the preset maps. The hierarchical-map updating process is just for the upper map and the lower map is updated after a certain running term. In the calculation, the state data of the upper map is far less than that of the lower map.

The performance of power efficiencies, bandwidth efficiency, BER and SNR for the four modulation schemes have studied and compared in this paper include On-Off keying (OOK), Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK) and Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) without atmospheric turbulence.

When take intensity scintillation under Gamma-Gamma turbulence channel into consideration and the average BER is derived with Meijer- G function, BER performances of BPSK and QPSK scheme approximate the same.

Cluster Based Routing Protocol (CBRP) is a robust and scalable routing protocol for MANETs. Clustering formation algorithm used in CBRP is a variation of simple lowest-ID algorithm in which the node with a lowest ID among its neighbors is elected as the Cluster head. Neglecting mobility and energy for selecting cluster head is one of the weakness points of the algorithm. In order to increase stability of the network and to prevent re-clustering an adaptive energy-aware Cluster Based Routing Protocol (AECBRP) is proposed. Two algorithms have been introduced in AECBRP as enhancement to the CBRP: improving the cluster formation algorithm by considering relative mobility, residual energy and connectivity degree metrics, and add in an efficient cluster maintenance algorithm based on the aggregate energy metric of cluster head. Using NS-2 we evaluate the rate of cluster-head changes, the normalization routing overhead and the packet delivery ratio.

The MMA7361L is an analog accelerometer with maximum sensitivity of 800 mV/g.

By using certain techniques in the design of signal conditioning circuits, then the MMA7361L can used to detect 3-axis vibration and 2-axis tilt angle at the same time. To accommodate the 5-signals from output of the sensor system, is constructed a data acquisition system based on PIC16F876 microcontroller, which provides 5-channels internal ADC with 10 bits resolution. Thus, the resulting integrated sensor system becomes very simple and inexpensive. Results of experiment show that the developed sensor system has proven having good performance. For the vibration sensor, voltage gains can be set up to 60 dB (800 V/g) with low-level noise. While the tilt sensor is capable of detecting up to ± 30 angle on the non-linearity of 4.5% (max), with average resolution of about 0.06 degrees.","Integrated sensor; MEMS-Accelerometer; Tilt-Angle; Vibration","Accelerometers; Data acquisition; Signal conditioning circuits; Data acquisition system; Integrated sensor system; Integrated sensors; Maximum sensitivity; MEMS accelerometer; Tilt angle; Vibration; Vibration sensors; Vibrations (mechanical)","Santoso, D.R.; Division of Instrumentation, Physics Department, Brawijaya University, Jl.

Multiple base stations in a given area serve each terminal after precoding, which can coordinate the inter-cell interference and achieve higher performance.

However, the requirements on backhaul signaling and computational power scales rapidly in large and dense networks, which usually make such fully centralized approaches impractical.

Unfortunately majority of the students are having difficulties in coping with these subjects. Malaysia is ranked third lowest in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) for mathematics and science. An emotionally disturbed student seems to have problem coping with the learning of mathematics and science thus it is important to identify the demotivating factors affecting the performance of such students. In this paper, itanalyze the correlation of precursor emotion towards student interest in learning mathematics and science using electroencephalogram (EEG) device. This correlation and their respective emotion can be analyzed based on the 2-D Affective Space Model (ASM) using four basic emotions of happiness, calmness, fear and sadness as reference stimuli. EEG device was used to extract brain waves signal while answering the mathematics and science questions. The EEG signals were captured on the scalp of the student and features extracted using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC). Neural network classifier of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) was used to classify the valence and arousal axes for the ASM. Preliminary results show the relationship of precursor emotion and the dynamic emotions of the student while taking the mathematics and science test.

The limitation of localization algorithms due to high color similarity is highlighted in several research papers. Hence, this research focuses towards the improvement of text localizing capability in high color background image similarity by introducing an adaptive text localization algorithm (ATLAS). ATLAS is an edge-based text localization algorithm that consists of two parts. Text-Background Similarity Index (TBSI) being the first part of ATLAS, measures the similarity index of every text region while the second, Multi Adaptive Threshold (MAT), performs multiple adaptive thresholds calculation using size filtration and degree deviation for locating the possible text region. In this research, ATLAS is verified and compared with other localization techniques based on two parameters, localizing strength and precision. The experiment has been implemented and verified using two types of datasets, generated text color spectrum dataset and Document Analysis and Recognition dataset (ICDAR). The result shows ATLAS has significant improvement on localizing strength and slight improvement on precision compared with other localization algorithms in high color text-background image. © 2015 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

One of the prevention methods is recognizing the distribution pattern of hotspot as one of forest and land fire indicators. We could determine the area that has high fires density based on distribution patterns so any early prevention steps could be performed in that area. This research proposed to recognize the distribution pattern of hotspot clusters in the peatland areas in Sumatera in the year 2014 using Kulldorff's Scan Statistics (KSS) method with Poisson model. This approach was specifically designed to detect clusters and assess their significance via Monte Carlo replication. Results showed that the method is reliable to detect the clusters of hotspots which have the accuracy of 95%. Riau and South Sumatera province have the highest density of cluster distributions of the hotspot. Based on the maturity level of peat, cluster distributions of hotspot were mostly found in 'hemic' maturity level. Based on peatland thickness, cluster distribution of hotspot was mostly found in 'very deep' thickness. © 2015 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Clustering; Hotspot; Peatland; Poisson process; Scan statistics","Clustering algorithms; Wetlands; Clustering; Hot spot; Peatland; Poisson process; Scan statistics; Poisson distribution","Kirana, A.P.; Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Natural Science and Mathematics, Bogor Agricultural UniversityIndonesia; email: puspakirana@apps.ipb.ac.id",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Drone is flown autonomously from the initial position (x, y,z) to the desired position called waypoint using Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). The FLC consists of three control loops which are pitch control loop, roll control loop and vertical rate control loop. For each control loop, desired position and real position are used as inputs of the FLC, while pitch, roll and vertical rate are used as output respectively. The algorithm is realised in three flight schemes and the navigation data is recorded. The first flight scheme: a desired x-position of AR. Drone will be reached first followed by a desired y-position, and lastly a desired z-position. The second flight scheme: a desired x-position and y-position will be reached simultaneously followed by a desired z-position. The third flight scheme: AR. Drone flies towards to desired position simultaneously. The results show that the AR. Drone can reach the waypoint with the three schemes well.

However, in real situations where constant harmonic vibrations are not present, the equivalent voltage from piezoelectric cantilever beams with excitations is not necessarily sinusoidal. In the present study, a simulation analysis of four different interface circuits with signal sources that are both damped sinusoidal and random was performed using Matlab and PSpice. The results show that the interface circuits have improved performance under low load resistance values with damped sinusoidal signal.

The sparse representation of the image can better extract the nature of the image, and use a way as concise as possible to express the image. In image denoising based on sparse representation, the useful information of the image possess certain structural features, which match the atom structure. However, noise does not possess such property, therefore, sparse representation can effectively separate the useful information from noise to achieve the purpose of denoising. Aiming at image denoising problem of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) image, combined with Orthogonal Matching Pursuit and sparse representation theory, this paper puts forward an image denoising method. The experiment shows that compared with the traditional image denoising based on Symlets, image denoising based on Contourlettransform, this method can delete noise in low SNR image and keep the useful information in the original image more efficiently.

As known that large scale ships have great developments in recent years which could cause much severer conditions among the interaction between the propulsion system and ship hull. Excited forces from these waves could make the ship hull deformed which further cause drastic vibrations of the shaft system. As a result, the malfunctions of shaft propulsion system are potential existed as the vibrations of the shaft always exceed its maximum allowable values. This paper establishes a simplified model of the large ship propulsion-hull system to analyze the vibration behavior of the ship propulsion system subjected to the ship hull deformations.

For long distance fiber cable, there is a possibility of optical fiber to bend with very small radius especially in joint closures which caused optical power to attenuate. This attenuation is known as 'bend losses. Bend lossincreases the total power attenuation of optical fiber. In addition, for long distance fiber cable, it is important to avoid any extra loss as the fiber itself attenuates 0.2 to 0.35 dB/km and splice loss about 0.1 dB each. Hence, in this study, the method of detecting bend loss as well as optical fiber bending is presented. The result of this study is expected to allow fiber industry players to determine the exact location and proper rectification can be done to solve bend loss problem. © 2015 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Bend loss; Optical fiber bend; Optical ground wire; Power attenuation","Cables; Optical fibers; Bend loss; Fiber cables; Optical ground wires; Optical power; Power attenuation; Splice loss; Total power; Utility companies; Fibers","Salleh, M.F.M.; Telecommunication Research and Innovation (CeTRI), Faculty of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM)Malaysia; email: mfazli.msa@tnb.com.my",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

When the responses of the normal circuits are similar to those of the faulty circuits (i.e., the latter have only small parametric faults), the sample space is mixed and traditional algorithms have difficulty distinguishing the two groups. However, the SVM provides an effective result. The sample space contains redundant data, because successive impulse-response samples may get quite close. The redundancy will waste the needless computational load. So we propose three difference methods to compress the sample space. The compressing sample space methods are Equidistant compressional method, k-nearest neighbors method and maximal difference method.

This proposed method uses speaker classification strategy based on human voice's original characteristics, such as pitch, flatness, brightness, and roll off. DAMClass decomposes available dataset into smaller sub-datasets in the form of classes or buckets based on the similarity of speaker's original characteristics. DAMClass builds speaker dataset index based on range-based indexing of direct access facility and uses nearest neighbor search, range-based searching and multiclass-SVM mapping as its access method. Experiments show that the direct access strategy with multiclass-SVM algorithm outperforms the indexing accuracy of range-based indexing and nearest neighbor for one to nine percent.

For this implementation, we investigated two types of nonlinear filtering, Converted Measurement Kalman Filter (CMKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). IMM algorithm is used to anticipate target motion uncertainty. Many simulations on radar target tracking are developed under assumption that noise characteristic is known. In this paper, the performance of IMMCMKF and IMM-UKF is evaluated for condition that radar doesn't know noise characteristic and there is mismatch on noise modeling. Results from simulation show that IMM-CMKF has better performance than IMM-UKF when tracking maneuvering trajectory.

There are many factors that cause high mortality numbers; one of them is the delay in handling cases of high-risk pregnancies. The main problem faced by developing countries is the lack of health facilities, including medical equipment and human resources. This research aims to develop a simple system that can be used to screen high-risk pregnancies. This system is based on an expert system. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is used in making decisions about potentially high-risk pregnancy patients. Essentially, the system can be used by anyone, anywhere, to carry out early screening of high-risk pregnancy patients, so that delays in the treatment of these patients can be resolved, because the symptoms of high-risk pregnancy are known from the beginning.

The software is very simple and easy to use. With a standard laptop computer, it only takes few seconds to obtain transmission response, FSR and Q-factor of single MRR for varied waveguides separation distance and ring radius. The results were then verified using simulation method based on finite integration technique using 3D electromagnetic simulator, which need a high memory and processor of computer and take days to execute the simulation.

The artificial noise which is in the null space of the receiver channel matrix can deteriorate eavesdropper channel by the method of beam forming. The artificial noise power is distributed evenly in other space, so that the eavesdropper channel is deteriorated in all directions.

All measurements are done using a vector network analyzer (VNA) which allows us to measure the noise channel transfer functions. We find that the noise power of the system is decreased by increasing the intermediate frequency (IF) bandwidth which leads to an increase in time taken to perform measurements of the channels. The environmental noise power been measured and find that it decreased when enclosed in a Faraday cage (steel shed), within an intense multipath measurement environment. Also, the Environmental noise decreases slightly by using the LPDA antenna compared to using the Teardrop and Horn antennas. Our results show that the Horn antenna is less suitable for UWB channel measurements compared to the LPDA directional antennas because of lower S11 (Return Loss) values. While for omnidirectional antennas, the Teardrop antenna is much more suitable than the monocone antennas for UWB measurements (due to lower S11 values) and decreases the Environmental noise power. As secondary application, we show how a frequency detection device can be used to re-adjust a maladjusted frequency selection on a remote controller for a garage door, in presence of environmental noise power. © 2015 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Indoor ultrawideband (UWB); Noise channels","Acoustic noise measurement; Antennas; Communication channels (information theory); Directive antennas; Electric network analyzers; Horn antennas; Omnidirectional antennas; Remote control; Environmental noise; Frequency selection; Intermediate frequencies; Multi-path measurements; Noise channels; Ultra-wideband channels; UWB channel measurement; Vector network analyzers; Ultra-wideband (UWB)","Alshabo, A.; School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Northfields Avenue, Australia; email: amoa813@uowmail.edu.au",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

In the algorithm, particle swarm optimization is used to select anchor nodes set which are near the unknown node. The algorithm takes an element in the set, and measure distance between it and the other elements in the set. Then, the maximum likelihood method is used to calculate the coordinates. According to the difference between the calculated coordinates and the actual coordinates of the anchor node, the obtain coordinate of unknown node is corrected. When all the elements in the set perform such operation, the statistical methods are used to determine the coordinates of the unknown node. The algorithm embodies all the reference points influence on positioning, corrects the error problem on a single reference node positioning in the past.

To solve this problem, by adopting the dynamic programming philosophy, a navigation data bits estimation algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm uses the partial sum of correlation values as data bit combination searching branches. It can predict and exclude searching branches of data bit combination which have small coherent accumulated energy as soon as possible by angle quantification, thus reducing its computation load to be linearly related to the number of data bits needed to be estimated. Simulation results show that for signal of 500bps navigation data rate, the carrier track loop with a frequency discriminator implementing 0.12s coherent accumulation by navigation data estimation improves the tracking sensitivity up to 7 dB compared with traditional frequency discriminator under the same track accuracy constraint.","Dynamic programming; GNSS weak signal tracking; Navigation data bits estimation","Algorithms; Codes (symbols); Dynamic programming; Frequency estimation; Navigation; Computation loads; Correlation value; Estimation algorithm; Frequency discriminators; Navigation data; Number of datum; Tracking sensitivity; Weak signals; Global positioning system","Wu, S.; College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense TechnologyChina",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Malaysia is ranked third lowest in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) for mathematics and science. An emotionally disturbed student seems to have problem coping with the learning of mathematics and science thus it is important to identify the demotivating factors affecting the performance of such students. In this paper, itanalyze the correlation of precursor emotion towards student interest in learning mathematics and science using electroencephalogram (EEG) device. This correlation and their respective emotion can be analyzed based on the 2-D Affective Space Model (ASM) using four basic emotions of happiness, calmness, fear and sadness as reference stimuli. EEG device was used to extract brain waves signal while answering the mathematics and science questions. The EEG signals were captured on the scalp of the student and features extracted using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC). Neural network classifier of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) was used to classify the valence and arousal axes for the ASM.Preliminary results show the relationship of precursor emotion and the dynamic emotions of the student while taking the mathematics and science test.

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a very attractive technique for high data rate transmission with better bandwidth efficiency. In this paper, the effectiveness of turbo codes is utilized to develop a new approach for an OFDM system based on a Discrete Multiwavelet Critical-Sampling Transform (OFDM-DMWCST). The use of turbo coding in an OFDM-DMWCST system is useful in providing the desired performance at higher data rates. Two types of turbo codes were used in this work, i.e., Parallel Concatenated Convolutional Codes (PCCCs) and Serial Concatenated Convolutional Codes (SCCCs). In both types, the decoding is performed by the iterative decoding algorithm based on the log-MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) algorithm. The simulation results showed that, the turbo-coded OFDM-DMWCST system achieves large coding gain with lower Bit- Error-Rate (BER), therefore, offering a higher data rate under different channel conditions.

This kind of energy is unrenewable and limited. Use of solar panels (Photovoltaic, PV) to generate electricity is growing fast and it can be used as an alternative energy instead of fossils. The problem faced by use of solar panels is that the generated power is not optimum for a particular load. It is always changing and influenced by the level of light (irradiance) and temperature. Therefore we need a way to maximize the power output of solar panels. Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is a method for finding its maximum power point. In this research, the MPPT is designed to locate the point of generated maximum power on solar panels. MPPT controller designed in this research is using fuzzy logic. The voltage and current from the solar panels are fed to the fuzzy logic controller. The output of fuzzy logic in the form of a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal regulates the process of switching boost converter.

How to achieve high intrusion detection accuracy and speed is still received considerable attentions in this field. To address this issue, this work presents a novel method that takes advantages of multi-kernel computation technique to realize speedy and precise network intrusion detection and isolation. In this new development the multi-kernel function based kernel direct discriminant analysis (MKDDA) and quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) optimized kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) were appropriately integrated and thus form a novel method with strong intrusion detection ability. The MKDDA herein was firstly employed to extract distinct features by projecting the original high dimensionality of the intrusion features into a low dimensionality space. A few distinct and efficient features were then selected out from the low dimensionality space. Secondly, the KELM was proposed to provide quick and accurate intrusion recognition on the extracted features. The only parameter need be determined in KELM is the neuron number of hidden layer. Literature review indicates that very limited work has addressed the optimization of this parameter. Hence, the QPSO was used for the first time to optimize the KELM parameter in this paper. Lastly, experiments have been implemented to verify the performance of the proposed method. The test results indicate that the proposed LLE-PSO-KELM method outperforms its rivals in terms of both recognition accuracy and speed.

This paper discusses an algorithm to secure home agent network from the routing header vulnerability, where the home agent network uses IPv4 Network Address Translation (NAT) router. The algorithm also takes into account multi-hops destination in the routing header. Verification was done through implementation of the algorithm at the Home Agent modul in a testbed network. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides secure communication between Correspondent nodes and Mobile Nodes that moved into the NATed network without causing a significance filtering delay.","IPv6 routing header; IPv6 security; Mixed IP network; Mobile IP","Algorithms; Internet protocols; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Routers; Secure communication; Telecommunication networks; Correspondent nodes; IP networks; IPv4/IPv6 network; IPv6 security; Mobile iP; Network address translations; Routing header; Secure mobile communications; Network routing","Shenify, M.; College of Computer Science and Information Technology, Albaha University, P.O.

In order to get more objects by visiting few irrelevant web pages, the web crawler usually takes the heuristic searching strategy that ranks urls by their importance and preferentially visits the more important web pages. While some systems rely on crawlers that exhaustively crawl the Web, others incorporate ""focus"" within their crawlers to harvest application or topic-specific collections. However, very limited work has addressed the urgent issue of how to measure the crawled page's importance. In order to deal with this issue, this paper has presented a new model taking advantages of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to enhance the crawler performance. In this new model the improved HMM learning ability is employed to solve the problem of the theme of the crawler drift and thus improve the data acquisition accuracy. Numerical simulation tests have been carried out to verify the performance of the proposed approach. The analysis results have shown that the new model was very efficient and was superior to the existing Bayesian probabilistic model, Naïve Bayes model, and K-Nearest Neighbor Approach. Thus, the proposed improved HMM based approach can be used in practice.","Crawler; Hidden markov model; Uniform resource locator","Bayesian networks; Data acquisition; Heuristic algorithms; Hidden Markov models; Information retrieval systems; Markov processes; Search engines; Social networking (online); Websites; Bayesian probabilistic models; Crawler; Dynamic nature; Hidden Markov chains; K-nearest neighbors; Learning abilities; Searching strategy; Web-based information; Information retrieval","Tu, J.; School of Computer Science and Technology, Hubei University of Technology, No. 1 NanHu Street, China",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

For better evaluation, the datasets include not only the computer generated graphs in standard benchmark but also the real-world networks which are classical ones in global community discovery.

The purpose of the work in this paper is to find the invariant features of facial images and represent each subject with only one training sample for face recognition. We propose a two-layer hierarchical model, called invariance model, and its corresponding algorithms to keep the balance of accuracy, storage and running time. Especially, we take advantages of wavelet transformations and invariant moments to obtain the key features as well as reduce dimensions of feature data based on the cognitive rules of human brains. Furthermore, we improve usual pooling methods, e.g. max pooling and average pooling, and propose the weighted pooling method to reduce dimensions with no effect on accuracy, which let storage requirement and recognition time greatly decrease. The simulation results show that the proposed method does better than some typical and nearly-proposed algorithms in balancing the accuracy and running time.","Face recognition; Invariance model; Single training sample","Digital storage; Hierarchical systems; Sampling; Computing performance; Hierarchical model; Intelligent terminal; Invariant features; Recognition time; Single training sample; Storage requirements; Wavelet transformations; Face recognition","Tian, Q.; National ASIC Engineering Research Center, Southeast UniversityChina",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

This is one problem that is not easily solved by use of the technique similarity. Determination of dubious value similarity threshold on similarity method is another problem. The plagiarism threshold was adjustable, but it means uncertainty. Another problem, although the rules of plagiarism can be understood together but in practice, some people have a different opinion in determining a document, whether or not classified as plagiarism. Of the three problems, a statistical approach could possibly be the most appropriate solution. Machine learning methods like knearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN) is a technique that is commonly used in solving the problem based on statistical data. This method of learning process based on statistical data to be smart resembling intelligence experts. In this case, plagiarism is data that has been validated by experts. This paper offers a hybrid approach of SVM method for detecting plagiarism. The data collection method in this work using an Internet search to ensure that a document is in the detection is up-to-date.

First, we apply a preprocessing filter to the ultrasound for the sake of speckle reduction. Then the knowledge of the anatomical structure of human heart and local homogeneity of blood pool is being used to detect the border of left ventricle. The proposed method evaluates 80 ultrasound images from four healthy volunteers and the generated contours are compared with contours manually drawn by an expert. The measured Dice Metric and Hausdorff Distance recorded by the proposed algorithm are 85.1% ± 0.4% and 3.25 ± 0.46 mm respectively.

High demand on the load will cause unstable control power distributed through power loss via power transmition. Therefore smallscale electricity generation is required to ensure large power generated can be used for particular location to minimize power losses. In addition, the implementation of distribution generation will help to reduce the capital cost compared to the existing power plant due to space, speed and power requirement. Thus proper DG location will significantly improve the impact of the power flow analysis by considering the source of energy which is easily obtained.

Moreover, the use of local features began to increase over the last few years and has shown impressive results, especially in the field of object recognition. This article attempts to provide a survey of the recent technical achievements in this area of research. We review the use of local descriptors as the feature representation which is extracted from RGB-D images, in instances and category-level object recognition. We also highlight the involvement of depth images and how they can be combined with RGB images in constructing a local descriptor. Three different approaches are used in involving depth images into compact feature representation, that is classical approach using distribution based, kernel-trick, and feature learning. In this article, we show that the involvement of depth data successfully improves the accuracy of object recognition.","Depth images; Local descriptor; Object recognition; RGB-D images","Computer vision; Classical approach; Compact Features; Depth image; Feature learning; Feature representation; Local descriptors; RGB-D images; Vision communities; Object recognition","Rachmawati, E.; School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Institut Teknologi BandungIndonesia",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

The video input is firstly transformed into a suitable domain in order to achieve sparser configuration of coefficients. Then, we apply coefficient thresholding to classify which frames are to be sampled compressively or conventionally. For frames chosen to undergo compressive sampling, the coefficient vectors will be projected into smaller vectors using a random measurement matrix. As CS requires two main conditions, i.e. sparsity and matrix incoherence, this research is focused on the enhancement of the sparsity property of the input signal. It was empirically proven that the sparsity enhancement could be reached by applying motion compensation and thresholding to the non-significant coefficient count. At the decoder side, the reconstruction algorithm can employ basis pursuit or L1 minimization algorithm.","Compressive sampling; Motion Compensation; Signal sparsity; Sparse representation; Video coding","Image coding; Motion compensation; Coefficient vector; Compressive sampling; ITS applications; L1 minimizations; Random measurement; Reconstruction algorithms; Sparse representation; Video encodings; Compressed sensing","Wahidah, I.; School of Electrical Engineering, Telkom University, Jl.

Teknik Kimia, Gedung Teknik Informatika, Kampus ITS Sukolilo, Surabaya, Malaysia","Study in batik image retrieval is still challenging today. One of the methods for this problem is using a Color Difference Histogram (CDH), which is based on the difference of color features and edge orientation features. However, CDH is only utilising local features instead of global features; consequently it cannot represent images globally. We suggest that by adding global features for batik image retrieval, precision will increase. Therefore, in this study, we combine the use of modified CDH to define local features and the use of Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) to define global features. The modified CDH is performed by changing the size of image quantisation, so it can reduce the number of features. Features that are detected by GLCM are energy, entropy, contrast and correlation. In this study, we use 300 batik images which consist of 50 classes and six images in each class. The experiment result shows that the proposed method is able to raise 96.5% of the precision rate which is 3.5% higher than the use of CDH only. The proposed method is extracting a smaller number of features; however it performs better for batik image retrieval. This indicates that the use of GLCM is effective combined with CDH.","Batik; Color difference histogram; Gray level co-occurrence matrix; Image retrieval","Color; Colorimetry; Graphic methods; Matrix algebra; Batik; Color difference; Color features; Edge orientations; Global feature; Gray level co-occurrence matrix; Grey-level co-occurrence matrixes; Precision rates; Image retrieval","Minarno, A.E.; Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang, Jl.Raya Tlogomas No. 246, Kampus 3 Gedung Kuliah 3, Malaysia",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

To synchronize the signal-timing, the master controller sends the synchronization data to the local controller wirelessly, and the local controller can modify a cycle length by adding or subtracting the green interval of any phases. The transition time for synchronization only takes one to several cycles. The algorithm for controlling the traffic including coordination can be done by an AVR microcontroller.

One Dimensional Linear Discriminant Analysis is one of feature extraction method is development of Principal Component Analysis mostly used by researches. But, it has limitation, it can efficiently work when number of training sets greater or equal than number of dimensions of image training set. This limitation has been overcome by using Two Dimensional Linear Discriminant Analysis. However, search value of matrix identity R and L by using Two Dimensional Linear Discriminant Analysis takes high cost, which is O(n3). In this research, the seeking of ""Scatter between Class"" and ""Scatter within Class"" by using Discriminant Analysis without having to find the value of R and L advance are proposed.

Efficient handover and offloading schemes for integrated WLAN and cellular networks, referred to as Heterogeneous Wireless Networks, have thus attracted lots of attentions from both academia and industry. This paper proposes a novel Multiple-Threshold based Triggering (MTT) scheme for Cellular-to-WLAN handover control. Aiming at minimizing the probability of handover failures and unnecessary handovers, three thresholds are calculated based on a variety of network parameters such as system performance requirements, radius of the WLAN coverage, user mobility and handover delays. The thresholds are then compared against the predicted user residence time and estimated channel holding time inside WLAN to make vertical handover decisions (VHDs). Simulations were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of MTT and results show that MTT minimizes handover failures and avoids unnecessary handovers in integrated cellular and WLAN networks, thus providing satisfactory Quality of Service (QoS) to users and improving system resource utilization.","Handover failures; Integrated networks; Qos; Unnecessary handovers; Vertical handover decision","Computer simulation; Heterogeneous networks; Quality of service; Telecommunication links; Effective approaches; Estimated channels; Hand over; Handover failure; Heterogeneous wireless network; Integrated networks; Performance requirements; Vertical handover decisions; Wireless local area networks (WLAN)","Chen, L.; Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China; email: chenliming@hit.edu.cn",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Batik is widely used as clothing material. The advancement of technology allowed the material optimisation in clothing design. Geometrical information about abatik image is required in a module for optimising clothing design with batik as a raw material. Geometric feature extraction of batik image is used to help a computer to recognise batik's pattern or motif. This research proposes a method for geometric feature extraction of batik image by using cardinal spline curve representation. The method for geometric feature extraction is divided into 2 processes, i.e., feature extraction for Klowongan and feature extraction for Isen-Isen. Klowongan represents the pattern of batik image, whereas Isen-Isen is content patterns of Klowongan. Feature extraction of Klowongan is performed by deleting collinear points from object boundaries until the dominant points are obtained. The dominant points are then used as control points. Feature extraction of Isen-Isen is performed by saving coordinates of every connected component which are also used as control points. Geometricfeature of batik image is represented as a set of control points of klowongan and isen-isen. Batik image can be reconstructed by drawing cardinal spline curve using a set of control points in the geometric representation. The experiment shows that the reconstructed image is visually similar tothe original batik image.","Batik; Cardinal spline; Curve representation; Geometric feature extraction","Feature extraction; Batik; Cardinal splines; Curve representations; Geometric feature extraction; Geometric representation; Geometrical informations; Material optimisation; World cultural heritages; Image reconstruction","Fanani, A.; Department of Informatics Engineering, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS), Surabaya, Indonesia; email: arisfananie@gmail.com",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Load changes and disturbances cause EPS operation to find a new balance point and before can reach the new balance point, the rotor speed will swing around its synchronous speed. This phenomenon causes the stability of the EPS operation decrease significantly, moreover, when the disturbance is large the machine tend to become unstable. To overcome this problem, it is necessary to add a power system stabilizer (PSS). This research proposes ANFIS-PSS based on feedback-linearization to stabilize the EPS operation. Feedback-linearization is a nonlinear control technique which feedback and limits several outputs in order to make the nonlinear system acts as a linear system.

Hence, it is difficult for new workers to assess the ship state in the ship inspections.The present problems are that the ship inspection technical support level in China is not balanced, especially as to the current situation with low level, poor technologyin under-developed areas. In this paper, the case technology about the case-based reasoning to the ship inspection is proposed. The methods of normative inspection case representation are discussed.This is considered to be the basis of case-based reasoning. Then the tertiary case structure with the index is defined, in which the K-nearest neighbor method to calculate the similarity between caseswas used so that the ship's inspection information can be searched effectively. In addition, an improved retrievalstrategy of the nearest neighbor method is introduced. Therefore, in the inspection site, the inspectors can acquire support information by the case bases, and then the new cases are calculated automatically. Further, a ship inspection case management was introduced to improve the stability of the system. By carrying the case-based reasoning into an inspection, an inspector can generate fault information and inspection information simply and easily.

The dictionary is the fundamental part of it and the proper selection of dictionary is very important to achieve super performance. The global learned dictionary might achieve inferior performances since it could not mine the specific information such as the texture and edge which is contained in the blurred image. However, it is a computational burden to train a new dictionary for image deblurring which requires the whole image (or most parts)as input; training the dictionary on only a few patches would result in over-fitting. To address the problem, we instead propose an online adaption strategy to transfer the global learned dictionary to a specific image. In our deblurring algorithm, the sparse coefficients, latent image, blur kernel and the dictionary are updated alternatively. And in every step, the global learned dictionary is updated in an online form via sampling only few training patches from the target noisy image. Since our adaptive dictionary exploits the specific information, our deblurring algorithm shows superior performance over otherstate-ofthe- art algorithms.","Adaptive dictionary learning; Image deblurring; Sparse representation","Social networking (online); Adaptive dictionary learning; Computational burden; Deblurring algorithms; Image deblurring; Latent images; Learned dictionaries; Sparse representation; Specific information; Image enhancement","Kan, J.; School of Technology, Beijing Forestry UniversityChina",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

The goal of this paper is to find an estimator for the model order and the model parameter based on the data. In this paper, the model order identification and model parameter estimation is given in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. In this framework, the model order and model parameter are assumed to have prior distribution, which summarizes all the information available about the process. All the information about the characteristics of the model order and the model parameter are expressed in the posterior distribution. Probability determination of the model order and the model parameter requires the integration of the posterior distribution resulting. It is an operation which is very difficult to be solved analytically. Here the Simuated Annealing Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm was developed to compute the required integration over the posterior distribution simulation.

Unfortunately, its performance is poor at low SNR. In this paper we proposed a spectrum sensing method for cognitive radio network that improves the performance of energy detection. The proposed method based on distribution analysis using kurtosis as test statistic. This comes from the fact that distribution of received signal when a channel is occupied will be different from vacant channel. Noise tends to have a Gaussian distribution. Signal which faces multipath fading during the transmission way will have non Gaussian distribution. Sensing algorithm was tested using captured DTV signal. Result shows that our method performs well at low SNR. It achieves probability of detection of 90 % for 10 % Probability of false alarm for low SNR, below -20 dB.","Cognitive radio; DTV signal; Kurtosis; Spectrum sensing","Digital television; Fading (radio); Gaussian distribution; Higher order statistics; Radio systems; Signal to noise ratio; Statistical tests; Cognitive radio network; Distribution analysis; DTV signals; Kurtosis; Non-gaussian distribution; Probability of detection; Probability of false alarm; Spectrum sensing; Cognitive radio",,,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

One way to overcome these drawbacks is to use the One Time Password (OTP) algorithm. OTP is a password security system using dynamic passwords. The password will be valid for one session only. In this research, the author will analyse the reliability of the OTP algorithm by applying it to a LEGO Mindstorms robot. The robot will be designed as part of a system where the user will be safe to enter the default password, and then the system will change the password every session.

Information security awareness will be measured from a user's knowledge, behaviour, and attitude of five information security focus areas in telecommunications, especially related to smartphone users as one segment of telecommunication providers. For smartphone users, information security threats are not only from the Internet, but also from phone calls or texting. Therefore, the focus area in this research consists of adhering to security policy, protecting personal data, fraud/spam SMS, mobile applications, and reporting a security incident. This research uses an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method to measure the information security awareness level from smartphone users. In total, the result indicated that the awareness level is good (80%). Although knowledge and attitude dimension are good criteria of the awareness level, the behaviour dimension is average.

However, there are multiple service requests for the same functional web service at a time in practice and we cannot choose the best service for users every time because of the service's load.

Bit-stream rewriting is the simplest way without quality loss. However, rewriting is not a real transcoding scheme, since it needs to modify SVC encoders. This paper proposes a novel transcoding approach to support spatial scalability by minimizing the distortions generated from re-encoding process. The proposed scheme keeps the input bitstreams' information at maximum and adopts the hybrid upsampling method to do residue scaling, which can reduce the transcoding distortion into minimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the loss of the rate-distortion (RD) performance of the proposed transcoding scheme is better than Full Decoding Reencoding (FDR) which can get the highest video quality in general sense, by achieving up to 0.9 dB YPSNR gain while saving 95%~97% processing time.","H.264/AVC; Rewriting; SVC; Transcoding","Mobile devices; Motion estimation; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Scalability; Enhancement Layers; H.264/AVC; H.264/AVC standards; Reencoding process; Rewriting; Spatial scalability; SVC; Transcoding; Scalable video coding","Wu, Z.; University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Xiyuan Ave, Western High-tech, Chengdu, Sicuan, China; email: zywu813cn@yahoo.com.cn",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888863312

The sensors are evaluated with three criteria, i.e. stationary, dynamical response and collaborating with ITG3200 3-axis gyroscope for Kalman filter fusion. For stationary criterion, the ADXL345 is better than the other sensor for all stationary position. For dynamical response, both sensors suffer from the noise due to acceleration of the platform. The sensors do not only sense the gravity but also the acceleration of the platform when it is moved. But the noise level for the ADXL345 is lower than the other.

The test was based on IPT method with NH4Cl as contaminants. The industrial and coastal contaminants are used to explain the effect of contaminant at surface tracking process. The flow rate of contaminant was 0.3 ml/min. The 3.5 kV AC high voltage 50 Hz was applied to the top electrodes. It is found that industrial contamination resulting in the smallest surface leakage current is 327.6 mA. Also it is found that coastal contaminant showed the severest damage at surface of test sample.

In this paper a recursive detector for M-ary signals over fast time varying mobile communication channel is introduced. The proposed detector continuously estimates the channel directly within the metric calculation of the loglikelihood function in a recursive manner. The estimation of the channel is performed by the covariance form of the recursive least square approach. The performance of the detector is evaluated in terms of the misdetection probability. The effects of timing and phase offsets on the performance of detector are examined by simulation.

The classic problem of content Based image retrieval (CBIR) is the lack of accuracy in matching between image query and image in the database. By using region growing technique on DC image, it reduced the number of image regions indexed. The proposed of recursive region growing is not new technique but its application on DC images to build indexing keys is quite new and not yet presented by many authors. The experimental results show that the proposed methods on segmented images present good precision which are higher than 0.60 on all classes. So, it could be concluded that region growing segmented based CBIR more efficient compared to DC images in term of their precision 0.59 and 0.75, respectively. Moreover, DC based CBIR can save time and simplify algorithm compared to DCT images. The most significant finding from this work is instead of using 64 DCT coefficients this research only used 1/64 coefficients which is DC coefficient.","DC coefficients; DC domain; Region growing; Segmentation","Content based retrieval; Discrete cosine transforms; Image segmentation; Indexing (of information); Query processing; Content-Based Image Retrieval; DC coefficient; DC domain; Image indexing and retrieval; Region growing; Region-growing techniques; Segmentation techniques; Segmented images; Image retrieval","Irianto, S.Y.; Department of Informatics, Faculty of Computer Science, Darmajaya Informatics and Business Institute, Jl.

In this paper, EEMD (Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition)-based threshold de-noising method is proposed for power quality signal with different SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio). As a comparison, we use other four thresholds, namely, the heuristic threshold, the self-adaptive threshold, the fixed threshold and the minimax threshold to filter the noises from power quality signal. Through the analysis and comparison of three characteristics of the signal pre-and-post de-noised, including waveforms, SNR and MSE (Mean Square Error), furthermore the instantaneous attribute of corresponding time by HHT (Hilbert Huang Transform). Simulation results show that EEMD threshold de-noising method can make the waveform close to the actual value. The SNR is higher and the MSE is smaller compared with other four thresholds. The instantaneous attribute can reflect the actual disturbance signal more exactly. The optimal threshold EEMD-based algorithm is proposed for power quality disturbance signal denoising. Meanwhile, EEMD threshold de-noising method with adaptivity is suitable for composite disturbance signal de-noising.","Disturbance detection; EEMD; HHT; Power quality; Signal de-noising","Mathematical transformations; Mean square error; Noise pollution; Power quality; Quality control; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Disturbance detection; EEMD; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Hilbert Huang transforms; Instantaneous attributes; Power quality disturbances; Threshold algorithms; Threshold de-noising; Signal denoising","Gang, H.; Department of Electronic and Information Technology, Ningxia Polytechnic, Yinchuan 750021, Ningxia, China; email: kdhangang@163.com",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891679352

By using both fuels mostly the power factor (Cos φ) of resistive-inductive load variations were greater than 0.8, and they had slight difference on operational voltage. The drawback of using gaseous fuel is the frequency of the electricity might be not reach the standard frequency (i.e. 50 Hz). In the lab scale experiment, the gasoline consumption increased proportionally with the load increase, while using gaseous fuel the consumption of gas equal also increased where the average consumption value is 100 gram per 15 minutes operation for the tested load in the experiment.

Configuration of the driving circuit directly influences the efficiency of the coil launcher. This paper gives a detailed analysis of the properties of the driving circuit construction based on the capacitor source. Three topologies of the driving circuit are compared including oscillation, crowbar and half-wave circuits. It is proved that which circuit has the better efficiency depends on the detailed parameters of the experiment, especially the crowbar resistance. Crowbar resistor regulates not only efficiency of the system, but also temperature rise of the coil. Electromagnetic force (EMF) applied on the armature will be another problem which influences service condition of the driving circuits. Oscillation and crowbar circuits should be applied to both of the synchronous and asynchronous induction coil launchers, respectively. Half-wave circuit is seldom used in the experiment. Although efficiency of the half-wave circuit is very high, the speed of the armature is low. A simple independent half-wave circuit is proposed in this paper.

Three main parts of the generation system are synchronous generator, AVR-excitation, AGC modelled linearly. Generator is modelled by a single machine connected to infinite bus (SMIB) which is equipped by AVR and excitation linear model. Excitation control system made by optimizing the gain of the AVR (KA) and the governor with the gain of the AGC (Ki). Optimization is done using the method improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO).

The main idea of our proposed algorithm is that, routing path is established by the received signal strength indication (RSSI) value in the route discovery process of PB-AODV. The optimal transmitting power which can be computed by RSSI value, power threshold and node's surplus energy is encapsulated into route reply packet (RRP). Thus, the sender node can adaptively adjust its transmission power to save energy with the RRP.

The resonator can generate one odd mode and two even modes in the desired passband. Due to the main path signal counteraction, two transmission zeros Tz1, Tz2 can be created near the passband edge to achieve sharp skirt. Two transmission zeros Tz4, Tz5 are created between two harmonic frequencies hm2, hm3 by the folded open stub and the interdigital coupling feeding lines, respectively. Owing to the source-load coupling, one zero Tz3 is introduced to deepen the stopband. Meanwhile, the zero Tz1 is shifted to the lower cut-off frequency and the other three ones Tz2, Tz4, Tz5 can be slightly turned to suppress three harmonic frequencies hm1, hm2, hm3.

Unfortunately, sometimes the fulfillment of engine torque is not in line with fuel saving efforts. This requires the development of high performance and robust power train controllers. One way to potentially meet these performance requirements is to introduce a method of controlling engine torque using fuzzy gain scheduling. By using this method, the throttle opening commanded by the driver will be corrected by throttle correction signal that guarantees engine torque output will follow the desired engine torque input, and also reducing fuel consumption. In this case, spark ignition engine with automatic transmission is used to meet a good performance under this controller design. © 2012 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Engine torque; Fuzzy gain scheduling; Spark ignition engine","Automatic transmission; Controller designs; Engine torque; Fuel savings; Fuzzy gain scheduling; In-line; Performance requirements; Throttle opening; Fuel economy; Internal combustion engines; Torque; Engines","Triwiyatno, A.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Diponegoro UniversityIndonesia; email: aristriwiyatno@yahoo.com",,,16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883601599

In addition, ease, simplicity of controller design structure and high motion control performance are very important for practical applications. For satisfying these requirements, nominal characteristic trajectory (NCT) with proportional integral (PI) and notch filter (NF) as a compensator has been proposed as a practical control method for two-mass rotary PTP positioning systems. However, the effect of the actuator saturation cannot be completely compensated due to integrator windup when the object parameter varies. This paper presents a method to further improve nominal characteristic trajectory following (NCTF) controller to overcome the problem of integrator windup by adopting PI anti-windup schemes. The improved NCTF controller is evaluated experimentally using two-mass rotary positioning systems. The effect of the design parameters on the robustness of the improved NCTF with anti-windup integrator controller is evaluated and compared with NCTF without antiwindup integrator and the equivalent PID controller. The results show that the improved NCTF controller is effective to compensate the effect of integrator windup. © 2012 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Improved NCTF controller; Integrator windup; Positioning systems; Two-mass system","Actuator saturations; Anti-windup; Anti-windup schemes; Control methods; Control performance; Controller designs; Design parameters; Fast response; Integrator windup; Nominal characteristic trajectory following; Object parameters; PID controllers; Positioning system; Precision positioning systems; Proportional integral; Two-mass system; Navigation systems","Yakub, F.; Malaysia-Japan International Institute of Technology (MJIIT)Malaysia; email: irtif_81@yahoo.com",,,16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883603059

CPU times can be reduced by decomposing the problem in two subproblems, the first subproblem minimize the fuel cost of generation and the second subproblem is a reactive power dispatch so optimum bus voltages can be determined and reduce the losses by controlling tap changes of the transformers and the static VAR compensators (SVC).

The ground truth training samples of MCs in mammograms are assumed to be known as a priori. From these samples of the interest object class, a vocabulary of information-rich object parts is automatically constructed. The sparse representation is computed by the l1-regularized least square approach using the interior-point method. The method based on sparse representation expresses each testing sample as a linear combination of all the training samplesfrom the vocabulary. The sparse coefficient vector is obtained by l1-regularized least square through learning. MCs detectionis achieved by defining discriminatefunctions from the sparse coefficient vector for each category. To investigate its performance, the proposed method is applied to DDSM datasets and compared with support vector machines (SVMs) and twin support vector machines (TWSVMs). The experimental results have shown that the performance of the proposed method is comparable with or better than those methods. In addition, the proposed method is more efficient than SVMs and TWSVMs based methods as it has no need of model selection and parameter optimization.","Detection; Microcalcificationclusters; Sparse representation","Calcification (biochemistry); Error detection; Linear programming; Mammography; Sampling; Support vector machines; Vectors; X ray screens; Interior-point method; Linear combinations; Microcalcificationclusters; Parameter optimization; Regularized least squares; Sparse representation; Support vector machine (SVMs); Twin support vector machines; Least squares approximations","Zhang, X.; School of Management, Xian University of Architecture and Technology, No. 13 Yanta Road, Xian, Shaan Xi 710055, China; email: unixdaemon@126.com",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888626505

The experimental results show the cipher image histogram has a distribution of diversity and a significant difference to the plain image histogram, and frequency of occurrence of each intensity value in the histogram of cipher image is also uneven, which means can not provide clues to do statistical attack. The experimental results also showed a correlation between the elements of the image after encryption has decreased significantly.

In an effort to improve and perfect the performance of smile stages recognition, in this paper, we propose efficient Kernel based 2DPCA concepts. The Kernelization of 2DPCA can be benefit to develop the nonlinear structures in the input data. This paper discusses comparison of standard Kernel based 2DPCA and efficient Kernel based 2DPCA for smile stages recognition. The results of experiments show that Kernel based 2DPCA achieve better performance in comparison with the other approaches. While the use of efficient Kernel based 2DPCA can speed up the training procedure of standard Kernel based 2DPCA thus the algorithm can achieve much more computational efficiency and remarkably save the memory consuming compared to the standard Kernel based 2DPCA. © 2012 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","2DPCA; Efficient kernel; Feature extraction; Smile stages recognition; Standard kernel","Computational efficiency; Covariance matrix; Feature extraction; Matrix algebra; 2DPCA; Efficient kernels; Nonlinear structure; Smile stages recognition; Standard kernels; Training procedures; Two dimensional principal component analysis; Two dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA); Principal component analysis","Wahyuningrum, R.T.; Informatics Engineering Department, University of Trunojoyo Madura, Raya Telang PO BOX 2 Kamal, Bangkalan, Indonesia; email: rima_tw@yahoo.co.id",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883604522

First, an NPV model scheme is present for process identification, which is featured by its nonlinear hybrid Hammerstein model structure and varying model parameters. The hybrid Hammerstein model combines a normalized static artificial neural network with a linear transfer function to identify general nonlinear systems at each fixed working point. Meanwhile, a model interpolating philosophy is utilized to obtain the global model across the whole operation domain. The NPV model considers both the nonlinearity of transition dynamics due to the variation of the working point and the nonlinear mapping from the input to the output at fixed working points. Moreover, under the new NPV framework, the control action is computed via a multistep linearization method aimed for nonlinear optimization problems. In the proposed scheme, only low cost tests are needed for system identification and the controller can achieve better output performance than MPC methods based on linear parameter varying (LPV) models. Numerical examples validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","Hammerstein model; Nonlinear MPC; Nonlinear parameter varying (NPV)","Identification (control systems); Model predictive control; Neural networks; Nonlinear systems; General nonlinear systems; Hammerstein model; Hammerstein model structure; Linear parameter varying models; Linear transfer function; Non-linear optimization problems; Nonlinear MPC; Nonlinear parameter varying (NPV); Predictive control systems","Lu, J.; State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Department of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China; email: jglu@iipc.zju.edu.cn",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886751917

The mobile robot is equipped with a single camera which update sits pose whenever a landmark is available on the field of view. The innovation presented by this research focuses on the artificial landmark system which has the ability to detect the presence of the robot, since both entities communicate with each other using an infrared signal protocol modulated in frequency. Besides this communication capability, each landmark has several high intensity light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that shine only for some instances according to the communication, which makes it possible for the camera shutter and the blinking of the LEDs to synchronize. This synchronization increases the system tolerance concerning changes in brightness in the ambient lights over time, independently of the landmarks location. Therefore, the environment's ceiling is populated with several landmarks and an Extended Kalman Filter is used to combine the dead-reckoning and landmark information. This increases the flexibility of the system by reducing the number of landmarks required.

In straightforward method, the operator drives robot to certain pose either with moving manipulator tool-tip with hand or remotely. Once the desired pose achieved, the current pose is saved to memory. However, these methods are time consuming. An easy and quick approach is by imitating an object motion to robot with sensing devices. There have been numerous efforts for motion imitation either by using position sensitive detector (PSD) or by using stereo camera. However, a calibrated pre-condition should be done initially, which is not possible for natural movement. Here, this paper proposed motion preservation by capturing human motion naturally through Kinect and then reproduced human motion on humanoid robot simultaneously. In addition, the motions are also preserved in database for later used on robot motion generation and teaching as well. Furthermore, the robot motions are developed to run smoothly and close to human eye ability.

The optimality of control variables and minimum value of objective functions in OPF study would definitely change when DGs are interconnected to the grid. The change would be respect to the location, quantity and combination of power injection by DGs.

Furthermore, the inertial parameters of manipulator depend on the payload which is often unknown and variable. The sliding mode controller (SMC) provides an effective and robust means of controlling nonlinear plants. The performance of SMC depends on control parameter selection of gain switching (k) and sliding surface constant (s). It is very difficult to obtain the optimal control parameters. In this paper, a control parameter selection algorithm is proposed by genetic algorithm to select the gain switching (k) and sliding surface constant parameter (s) so that the controlled system can achieve a good overall performance in the sliding mode controller design. Testing is done by giving a reference position for joint 1 and joint 2 of the robot manipulator of 45° (degree) with the controller performance indicator is settling time <2 seconds, and the tracking error tolerance is 1%.

Hence in this research, the use of genetic algorithm (GA) method to optimize the Ergodic HMM was tested. In Hybrid HMM-GA, GA was used to optimize the Baum-Welch method in the training process. It was useful to improve the accuracy of the recognition result which is produced by the HMM parameters that generate the low accuracy when the HMM are tested.

The holistic features of face image are proposed as dimensional reduction of raw face image.

Moreover, email has no integrity protection so the body can be undectected altered in transit or on the e-mail server. Email also has no data origin authentication, so people cannot be sure that the emails they receive are from the e-mail address owner.

The building damage can be indexed by FEMA into three categories namely immediate occupancy (IO), life safety (LS), and collapse prevention (CP). To determine the damage index, the building model has been simulated into structure analysis software. Acceleration data has been analyzed using non linear method in structure analysis program. The earthquake load is time history at surface, PGA=0105g. This work proposes an intelligent monitoring system utilizing artificial neural network to predict the building damage index. The system also provides an alert system and notification to inform the status of the damage. Data learning is trained on ANN utilizing feed forward and back propagation algorithm. The alert system is designed to be able to activate the alarm sound, view the alert bar or text, and send notification via email to the security or management. The system is tested using sample data represented in three conditions involving IO, LS, and CP. The results show that the proposed intelligent monitoring system could provide prediction of up to 92% rate of accuracy and activate the alert.

The transmittance was numerically calculated by employing a transfer matrix method and including longitudinal-transverse kinetic energy coupling which is represented by an electron phase velocity in the gate. The transmittance was then applied to calculate tunneling currents in TiN/HfSiOxN/SiO2/p-Si MOS capacitors. The calculated results show that as the gate electron velocity increases, the transmittance decreases and therefore the tunneling current reduces. The tunneling current becomes lower as the equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) of HfSiOxN layer increases. When the incident electron passed through the barriers in the normal incident to the interface, the electron tunneling process becomes easier. It was also shown that the tunneling current was independent of the substrate orientation.

Focusing on achieving better speed performance of fingerprint identification on common computation machine, a disquisition was conducted on sequential access method for fingerprint identification, with its underlying data structure designed to work with parallel processing. Hypothetically, parallel processing based on multi-cores processor technology, can give faster result without reducing accuracy. If multi core processor was detected, simultaneous processes would run on fingerprint matching-pairs to find its similarity score, respectively. Experiment confirms that speed performance of fingerprint identification using sequential access method with parallel processing outperforms the one without parallel processing. For both strategy, even though using parallel processing confirms faster result, experiment shows that searching time O(n) still linearly depends on number of fingerprints in database.

For recent machine layouts, one cannot rely on standard analysis methods. In multiphysics simulations which are done by weak coupling finite-element method, rotation boundary values on interface between air gap and rotor cannot be applied directly for fluiddynamical analysis. A novel multi-component fluid method is proposed to deal with the influence of rotor rotation upon the air convection. This paper investigates a 3-D multi-physics simulation used in simulation of temperature distribution in air-cooled induction motor. The temperature rise in motor is due to Joule's losses in stator windings and the induced eddy current in squirrel cages, and heat dissipation by air convection and solid conduction. The Joule's losses calculated by 3-D eddy-current field analysis are used as the input for the thermal field analysis, which deeply depends on accurate air fluid field analysis.

The experiment results showed that the flashover voltage fluctuates from 34.13 kV up to 40.92 kV and tends to decrease on each variation of material composition. The surface leakage current fluctuates and tends to increase. Test samples with higher filler content result greater hydrophobicity, smaller equivalent salt deposit density, and smaller critical leakage current, which caused the increase of the flashover voltage.

Nowadays, the building lighting source is dominated by the use of fluorescent lamps. The previous technical papers by other researchers had focused on power density control of incandescent lamps, which is now rarely used, unconsidered national standard as control reference value, and required a high-cost in investment. By these reasons, this paper proposes a building lighting system based on fuzzy logic scheme to automate fluorescent lamps in order to achieve illumination according to Indonesian National Standard (SNI). The input variables were indoor lighting, inference from outdoor lighting, and occupancy. The output variable was the required illumination to achieve the standard. The required illumination determined the number of lamps that had to be turned on. In the experiment result, a classroom illumination of lighting without controller in workdays was about 350 lux, while with the proposed controller it varied between 250-300 lux close to the SNI, i.e. 250 lux.

The effect of the voltage vector on toque is dependent on α, torque angle and parameters of PMSM.

The attitude was determined using a deterministic (QUEST) and recursive (EKF) approach. A problem arises when using the sun sensors while the satellite experiencing eclipse. Consequently, the accuracy of both approaches was analyzed at eclipse and no eclipse conditions.

Restricted computational power, reduced memory, narrow bandwidth and energy supplied present strong limits in sensor nodes. Therefore, maximizing network lifetime and minimizing energy consumption are always optimization goals. To overcome the computation and energy limitation of individual sensor nodes during image transmission, an energy efficient image transport scheme is proposed, taking advantage of JPEG2000 still image compression standard using MATLAB and C from Jasper. JPEG2000 provides a practical set of features, not necessarily available in the previous standards. These features were achieved using techniques: the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and embedded block coding with optimized truncation (EBCOT). Performance of the proposed image transport scheme is investigated with respect to image quality and energy consumption. Simulation results are presented and show that the proposed scheme optimizes network lifetime and reduces significantly the amount of required memory by analyzing the functional influence of each parameter of this distributed image compression algorithm. © 2011 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Distributed image compression; Energy conservation; JPEG2000; Wireless sensor networks","Digital image storage; Discrete wavelet transforms; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; MATLAB; Sensor nodes; Wavelet transforms; Wireless networks; Wireless sensor networks; Compression scheme; Computational power; Distributed image compression; Embedded block coding with optimized truncation; JPEG 2000; Multihop wireless network; Real time data transmission; Still image compression; Image compression","Nasri, M.; Laboratoire de Micro-Optoélectronique et Nanostructures, Faculte des Sciences de Monastir (Institut Superieur d'Informatique et de Mathematiques de Monastir), Université de MonastirTunisia; email: nasrimohsen@yahoo.fr",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867053054

Hence, the Doppler parameter is very important and must be considered in broadband mobile communication system design and analysis. Unfortunately, it is hard to derive the expressions of this Doppler spectrum in a closed form since a special function under integration such as complete elliptic integral exists. To solve this problem, curve-fitting method base on least-square is used. In this process, curtailed-Gaussian and cosine functions are proposed as an approximation function. Then, from Kullback-Leiber divergence test, it is showed that both proposed functions, i.e., curtailed-Gaussian and cosine functions have a good approximation as Doppler spectrum modeling of Multihop mobile channel with all gain relays assumed as 1 and all mobile terminals are assumed move with almost same velocity.","Doppler; Mobile; Modeling; Multihop; Spectrum","Broadband networks; Cosine transforms; Curve fitting; Doppler effect; Functions; Gaussian distribution; Integral equations; Least squares approximations; Models; Radio broadcasting; Amplifyand-forward relay; Broadband mobile communication systems; Complete elliptic integrals; Doppler; Kullback-Leiber divergences; Mobile; Multihop; Spectrum; Mobile telecommunication systems","Suryani, T.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember Surabaya, Kampus ITS Sukolilo, Surabaya 60111, Indonesia; email: itiks@ee.its.ac.id",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883602264

This technique plays a role of situation classifier to judge the situation around the mobile robot environment and makes control decision in mobile robot navigation. The WNNs technique is choosen due to significant advantages over conventional neural network, such as they can be easily implemented in hardware using standard RAM, faster in training phase and work with small resources. Using a simple classification algorithm, the similar data will be grouped with each other and it will be possible to attach similar data classes to specific local areas in the mobile robot environment. This strategy is demonstrated in simple mobile robot powered by low cost microcontrollers with 512 bytes of RAM and low cost sensors. Experimental result shows, when number of neuron increases the average environmental recognition ratehas risen from 87.6% to 98.5%.The WNNs technique allows the mobile robot to recognize many and different environmental patterns and avoid obstacles in real time.

However, the signatures produced by these techniques are not unique and sometimes lead to misinterpretation of faults. Consequently, a decision tree based on the inverse Stockwell transform method is proposed in the present paper to automatically identify both the symmetrical and unsymmetrical power system faults. The method is able to determine both sudden and gradual changes in the signal caused by different power system faults.

Aceh also has experiencing a number of natural hazards; flood, earthquakes, and volcano's eruptions. Until now, Aceh has no natural hazards information system which can be used to increase public awareness in order to reduce the impact of the hazards. Natural hazards information system provides hazard maps as the guideline for disaster risk mitigation planning. Therefore, the development of a Web GIS based information system for Aceh natural hazards, referred as Aceh Natural Hazards Information System (ANHIS), is a very strategic decision to increase public awareness of the risks of natural disaster hazard in Aceh. This paper proposes conceptual design and the development of prototype for ANHIS. The main purpose of ANHIS is to visualize many natural hazards maps and disseminate information of the hazardous areas for disaster agencies, researchers and communities in order to help them act on warning issue. In order to develop the prototype, the system requirements, configuration, system design and implementation are presented in this paper. Furthermore, the results of prototype for ANHIS are demonstrated in terms of individual hazard map and multi-hazard map of many natural hazards in Aceh. Finally, the conclusions give the perspectives for future implementation of ANHIS.","Anhis; Hazard map; Information system; Multi-hazard; Web GIS","Conceptual design; Disasters; Geographic information systems; Information dissemination; Information systems; Public risks; Web crawler; Anhis; Design and implementations; Hazard map; Multi-hazards; Natural disasters; Strategic decisions; System requirements; Web-GIS; Hazards","Nasaruddin; Electrical Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, Syiah Kuala University, Jl.

Of the several types of camera distortions, researchers concentrated on the radial distortion being the most severe part of the total lens aberrations. Often, polynomial approximations by introducing distortion-specific parameters into the camera model have been methods of evaluating distortions. Of the two types of radial distortions, barrel, is the most discussed probably because of its dominance in cheap wide-angle lenses. In this paper, an approach to estimating and minimizing pincushion distortion by using fundamental surface area properties of the distorted image is proposed. This paper is significant as it reveals the importance of the topic and its implications on the camera. Demonstrations using four camera lenses show the robustness of this technique under different focal lengths conditions.

The VSI gate control switching pulses are derived from proposed Adaptive-Fuzzy-Hysteresis Current Controller (HCC) and this method calculates the hysteresis bandwidth effectively using fuzzy logic.

Net powers profile as a function of oxygen excess ratio for some points of operation are analyzed by using FCS model. The relationships between stack current and the corresponding control input voltage that gives an optimal oxygen excess ratio are used to design a feedforward control scheme. The results of this scheme are compared to the results of a feedforward control using a constant oxygen excess ratio. Simulation results show that optimal oxygen excess ratio improves fuel cell performance compared to the results of constant oxygen excess ratio. The same procedures are performed experimentally for the FCS system. The behaviour of the net power of the fuel cell stack with respect to the variation of oxygen excess ratio is analyzed to obtain optimal values. Data of stack current and the corresponding voltage input to the compressor that gives optimal values of oxygen excess ratio are used to develop a feedforward control.

One of the common difficulties faced by the developer is in designing a robust database system. Even so, in order to solve this matter, developers have to focus their efforts on the formal specifications. The formal specification is supposed to reduce the overall development time. Formal specifications can be used to provide an unambiguous and precise supplement to natural language descriptions. Besides, it can be rigorously validated and verified leading to the early detection of specification errors. Consequently, to validate this problem formally, we specify the SIDIF database framework using Z language and prove by using Z/EVES theorem proven tool. By using this kind of tools, it may help to reduce time, energy and mistake compared to manual theorem proving which can be error task and tedious.","Formal specification; SIDIF; Software engineering; Z specification language","Database systems; Query processing; Search engines; Software engineering; Specification languages; Specifications; Development time; Formal validation; Natural languages; Reduce time; SIDIF; Spatial informations; Z language; Z specification language; Formal specification","Man, M.; Dept. of Computer Science, Fac. of Science and Technology, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, 21030 Kuala Terengganu, Terengganu, Malaysia; email: mustafaman@umt.edu.my",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883604612

It is also corroborated that the size of signatures of PQ disturbances are proportional to its magnitude, so this feature of the signature is used for indexing the level of PQ disturbance in three sub-classes' viz. high, medium, and low. Further, the effect of number of neurons used by neural network on the performance of recognition is also analyzed.

The environmental setup affects the behaviors of both the humans and the robots, as they respond differently under varying accoustic or lightning conditions. Moreover, conducting several experiments repeatedly with the humans as test subjects also causes behavioral changes in them and eventually the responses remain no longer similar to the already conducted experiments. Thus making it is impossible to perform interaction scenarios in a repeatable manner. Developing and using 3D simulations, where different parameters can be adjusted, is the most beneficial solution in such cases.

The Output power can be adjusted by controlling the generator speed and pitch angle of wind turbine. When the wind speed below the wind turbine rated, the output power of generator can be maximized by controlling the generator speed at point of maximum power coefficient. When the wind speed above the wind turbine rated, output power of wind turbine will exceed the power generators rated. In this condition, the output power of wind turbine needs to be regulated to conform to the generator power rate. Output power of wind turbine can be regulated by adjusting the pitch angle of wind turbine.

In this technique, the test fixture is simulated numerically to get S (scattering) parameter data. Then the S parameter is converted into the T parameter (transfer) to be used for de-embedding process by removing the characteristic of test fixture used so that the true characteristics of a microwave absorber material can be revealed.

We believe that the concepts here will provide an insight into how to approach the PCI requirements to undertake the task. The software artefact should also serve as a guide to developers attempting to implement new applications, where security and design are fundamental elements that should be considered through each phase of the software development lifecycle and not as an afterthought. © 2011 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Credit card; Data security standards; Payment card industry; Primary account number","Application programs; Electronic commerce; Credit cards; Data security standards; Generic solutions; Payment card industries; Primary account numbers; Software applications; Software artefacts; Software development life cycle; Software design","Curran, K.; Faculty of Computing and Engineering, University of Ulster, Derry, Ireland; email: kj.curran@ulster.ac.uk",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883601330

Due to the use of narrow period pulse, according to the Fourier transform duality, therefore ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna becomes one of the most important needs in SPR system. In this paper, a novel UWB printed antenna is proposed to be used for SPR application. Basically, the proposed antenna is developed from a rectangular microstrip antenna fed by symmetric T-shaped. Some investigation methods such as resistive loading, abrupt transition, and ground plane modification are attempted to achieve required characteristics of bandwidth, radiation efficiency, and compactness needed by the system. To obtain the optimum design, the characteristics of proposed antenna are numerically investigated through the physical parameters of antenna. It is shown that proposed antenna deployed on an FR-4 Epoxy substrate with permittivity of 4.3 and thickness of 1.6mm has a compact size of 72.8mm x 60.0mm and a large bandwidth of 50MHz-5GHz which is suitable for SPR application. © 2011 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Abrupt transition; Surface penetrating radar; U-shaped ground plane; Ultra-wideband","Antenna grounds; Bandwidth; Electromagnetic waves; Microstrip antennas; Microwave antennas; Radar; Radar antennas; Abrupt transition; Investigation methods; Radiation efficiency; Rectangular-microstrip antennas; Surface penetrating radar; U-shaped ground planes; Ultra-wideband antennas; Ultra-wideband printed antenna; Ultra-wideband (UWB)","Simorangkir, R.B.V.B.; Electrical Engineering Department, Institut Teknologi Harapan Bangsa, Jalan Dipatiukur No. 80-84, Bandung 40132, Indonesia; email: roy@ithb.ac.id",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84255179150
