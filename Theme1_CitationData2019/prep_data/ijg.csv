Many parties have referred the number of 17,504 islands even though it has not yet been supported by back-up documents; (iv) Hidrographic Office of Indonesian Navy has released with numbers of 17,499; (v) Other sources indicated different numbers of islands, and indeed will imply to people confusion. In the other hand, the number of 13,466 named islands has a strong document (Gazetteer). Second, enumerating the total number of islands in Indonesia can be proposed by three ways: (i) island census through toponimic survey, (ii) using map, and (iii) applying remote sensing images. Third, the procedures of searching valid result in number of islands is by remote sensing approach - high resolution satellite images.

The growth of cities leads a lot of problems like environmental degradation, traffic congestion, poverty, crime and other social conflicts. Such a rapid rate of urbanization is a reflection of the inequity between rural and urban development. Lack of employment opportunities in the village causes the population to go into town to find work. The imbalance of development that occurs is a result of implementing a liberal economic system that only emphasizes growth, while on the other side of the agricultural sector is not paid any appropriate attention.

The motivation for carrying out this study arose from the observation that recreational facilities in Phase 1 of the Federal Capital City Abuja are not clearly developed as intended by the policy makers and thus, the need to identify the recreational facilities in the Phase 1 of FCC and observe their level of development as well as usage. The field survey revealed that the Central Business District and Gazupe have higher numbers of recreational facilities with 45 and 56. While Wuse II (A08) and Wuse II (A07) Districts have lesser recreational facilities with 10 and 17. The field survey further revealed that all the districts in Phase 1 have over 35% cases of land use changes from recreational facilities to other use. The survey shows that over 65% of these recreational facilities are fully developed.

In this study, the researcher used remote sensing techniques with SPOT images, and panchromatic as well as infrared aerial photographs scaled at 1:50 000 and 1:30 000 respectively. Field work was also employed in primary data collection. To identify the hydroloigc potential phenomena that need to be preserved, spatial and qualitative analysis methods were used. Results indicate that hydrologic divide of the Bribin catchment area can easily be delinaeted on aerial photographs for Oya/Sambipitu formation but difficult for limestone karst formation. Landform units in karst topography were identified and delineated basing on the density of limestone hills and solution process using aerial photographs. On the other hand, hydrologic occurrences such as stream flow comes out and suddenly cuts into the cave, springs and sinkholes which appeared very clearly on the infrared aerial photographs, emerge in karst topography. Hydrologic phenomena were inferred by land slope and length of dry valley as uvalas lineament. Groundwater subsurface flow in karst topography could be traced from Tambakromo cave and its proceeds on to the Gilap cave in the southeast and finally to the Jomblang cave in the south. From this point, the flow follows three directions, that is, towards the east (Brokomo-Pricimantoro), to the south (Southern coast), and to the southwest (Bribin cave).

This enables to draw a more complete picture of rural-urban linkage from and to all directions between Yogyakarta Municipality and its vicinity. The study reveals that the surveyed villages have experienced a great spatial and socio-economic transformation. Continuous provision of infrastructural support from the government has led to a better integration of rural areas to the main regional center of Yogyakarta Municipality. The most evident spatial changes are found in terms of land use in the main corridors from Yogyakarta Municipality to various directions. Employment structure is characterized by the importance of non-farm activities related to the urban sector. Service and trading activities are the most important source of employment for those who conduct commuting, either as employees or independent workers in both urban formal and informal sectors. Another type of non-farm employment is food processing and services are to be found in situ in the growing rural urban zone.

Partly as a result of the development implemented these tend to be concentrated in urban areas of Java, especially around the primate city of Jakarta.

Various volcanic materials were emitted on to the surface, including lava flows, gases, volcanic ash, sand and big blocks. The heavy rainfall which accompanied the eruption led to the formation of rain lahars, which also posed a threat in the lower portions of the volcano.

In an attempt to prove the validity of this notion, the author of this paper set out between March and July, 1990 to conduct a research on agricultural production in Mbogoini village in Nyeri District, Kenya. The aim and purpose of the research was to try and establish if there was any significant difference in agricultural production between men managed farms and female managed farms. This research was conducted by employing oral interviews with husbands and wives (separately) on 59 randomly chosen households on the basis of interview schedules. The results of the research have shown that women are not only capable of successfully carrying out the bulk of the heavy agricultural tasks but also are better farm managers than men. This has greatly contributed not only to increased total agricultural production but also productivity in areas where women are actively involved in agriculture as decision makers as evidenced in Mbogoini village of Nyeri district. -from Author",,"agricultural production; comparative studies; developing country; farm management; production difference; women farmers; women's role; Kenya; Mbogoini; Nyeri District",,,,00249521,,,,"English",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026958473

The techniques can be categorized into two major types, ie urban and rural (urban-rural) orientation. Indonesian urban sprawl can be distinguished into two models, ie the Java and Outer Islands model. Java model is characterized by leap-frog (see for example Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Surakarta, Surabaya) and ribbon development (see for example Padang in Sumatra, Banjarmasin in Kalimantan, Kendari in Sulawesi). The physical, social, historical background are responsible for these conditions. The urban-rural oriented strategy is highly recommended for managing and controlling urban land growth on the island of Java whereas urban oriented techniques are suggested for managing and controlling urban land development on the outer islands. -Author",,"developing country; historical background; literative review; management technique; urban area; urban growth management; urban planning; urban sprawl; Indonesia",,,,00249521,,,,"English",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025523684

A short description is given of the most important government programmes in the sphere of small scale industrial development.
