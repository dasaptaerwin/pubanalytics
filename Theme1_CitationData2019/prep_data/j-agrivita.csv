Callus were initiated from basal petal and staminoid explants cultured on callus induction (CI) medium contained DKW basalt salts and kinetin:2,4-D ratios of 1:15.5, 1:7.8 or 1:3.9 and then transferred onto secondary callus growth (SCG) medium contained WPM basalt salts and kinetin:2,4-D ratios of 1:7.8 or 1:3.9. The calli were then subsequently transferred onto embryo development medium contained DKW basal salts with or without the addition of amino acids, adenine or activated charcoal for the formation of somatic embryos. Nine cacao genotypes were tested for their ability to develop somatic embryos. Results of this study indicated DKW medium supplemented with Kinetin in combination with 2,4-D effectively induced cacao somatic embryogenesis. The highest somatic embryos formation was abtained from kinetin:2,4-D ratio of 1:3.9 and 1:7.8 in CI and SCG medium respectively. Cacao genotype responses were highly explant type dependent. The developed method resulted in a high percentage of somatic embryo formation (5.6-66.7%), germination (50%) and plantlet conversion (65%) and a medium percentage of somaclonal variations based on SSRs marker analysis. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

A novel molyb-denum-reducing bacterium with the ability to utilize the pesticide glyphosate as a carbon source is reported. The characterization works were carried out utilizing bacterial resting cells in a microplate format. The bacterium reduces molybdate to Mo-blue optimally between pH 6.3 and 6.8 and at 34oC. Glucose was the best elec-tron donor for supporting molybdate reduction followed by lactose, maltose, melibiose, raffinose, d-mannitol, d-xylose, l-rhamnose, l-arabinose, dulcitol, myo-inositol and glycerol in descending order. Other requirements include a phosphate concentration at 5.0 mM and a molybdate concentration between 20 and 30 mM. The molybdenum blue exhibited an absorption spec-trum resembling a reduced phospho-molybdate. Molybdenum reduction was inhibited by mercury, silver, cadmium and copper at 2 ppm by 45.5, 26.0, 18.5 and 16.3%, respectively. Biochemical analysis identified the bacterium as Klebsiella oxytoca strain Saw-5. To conclude, the capacity of this bacterium to reduce molybdenum into a less toxic form and to grow on glyphosate is novel and makes the bacterium an important instrument for bioremediation of these pollutants. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Experiments were arranged in completely randomized design using three aerobic rice cultivars and PEG with four replications. Rice varieties (Inpago-8, IR64 and Situ Bagendit) were combined with four different PEG concentrations. Drought stress was simulated by different PEG solutions and with distilled water as control. Results indicated differentiations between hydro and on priming indicator time, while varietal difference was not significant. Fastest recorded time was obtained between 30-36 hours under hydro priming, PEG 100 g L-1 (63-69 hours) and 83-93 hours in PEG 200 g L-1 solution. Thus showing increased solution concentration led to prolonged priming indicator time. The highest germination percentage was obtained in Situ Bagendit treated with PEG 200 mg L-1 (90.25%) and the lowest obtained in Inpago-8 (75.75%) under control. It is better to use osmo-priming (PEG 200 g L-1) for teaching aerobic rice seed against drought stress.

The objective of this research was to analyse the suitable land available for agriculture. The research was conducted in Bogor, a hinterland regency of Jakarta. The methodology used includes two steps of analysis, which are land suitability and land availability analysis. Land suitability for agriculture was analysed using multi-criteria decision making method. Seven (7) criteria were included, which consist of soil class, land capability class, slope, elevation, slope aspect, land use/land cover and distance to roads. The criteria were weighted using the Analytical Hierarchy Process. Combining criteria weights and sub-criteria scores, an overlay model in Geographic Information System was applied. The result from land suitability analysis was used as a feed for determining land availability, considering the forest area status and land allocation in the official spatial land use plan. The results indicate that an area amounting to 87.5% of Bogor Regency is suitable for agriculture. Land which is suitable and available for agriculture is 16.7% of the regency’s area.

The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of plant growth regulators (PGRs) on callus induction from leaf tip explant and the effects of complex additives on PLBs formation and shoot develop-ment. The best combination of PGR was 3.0 mg L-1 Thidiazuron (TDZ) with 0.046 mg L-1 NAA supplemented in half-strength medium (1/2 MS) (Murashige &amp; Skoog, 1962). The percentage of survival and callus formation obtained were 96.0 % ± 19.8 and 52.0 % ± 16.5 respectively. Maximum shoot proliferation from PLBs was observed in Knudson C (KC) medium enriched with 15 % (v/v) coconut water. In this treatment, 10.2 ± 6.2 shoots were produced from one callus explant. Shoots were rooted on KC medium containing 15 % (v/v) coconut water and transferred in a medium mixture containing sphagnum moss, charcoal, brick and coco peat with the ratio of 1:1:1:1.

The entrance tunnels, where the male beetles are staying, are short, with a mean 4 cm long and mostly incline upwards from outside to inside at an angle of around 20º. To examine the role of males, another male or female (as the invader) was placed into a tunnel. When inhabitant males stayed in the tunnel they quickly expelled the invaders, regardless of their sex of the invaders. However, when an inhabitant male was removed an introduced male or female could freely enter the tunnel and was accepted by the inhabitant female. Upon replacing an inhabitant male with an invader male or female and then putting another invader male or female into the tunnel, no rejection occurred, suggesting that invader males and females play no role in guarding the tunnel. Based on the results an inhabitant male seems to have three responsibilities; protection of the gallery from invaders, protection of progeny (larva) from falling down and also keeping the gallery clean from frass.

A land evaluation for soybean was completed. IKONOS imagery was analyzed to delineate paddy fields, while a dynamic system modelling was developed integrating physical and socio-economic aspects. The research results showed that the land suitability class for soybean plantation in the paddy fields in Karawang Regency ranged from not suitable (N) to suitable (S2), with limiting factors such as temperature, fertility, nutrients retention, slope, erosion, rooting media and toxicity. Very limited arable land has been used actually for soybeans plantation due to low economic returns. The model predicts that if the development of soybean continues in its business as usual path, a deficit of soybean will increase in 2030. The model provides alternative scenarios to reduce the deficit. Prioritization was done spatially using the suitable land gradually. © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The isozyme patterns in zymogram were binary-coded by visual scores for each genotype, based on the thickness and the number in the appearance of bands on certain migration distance. The migration distances were measured based on values of Rf.

Several studies have shown that the use of carbohydrates as a carbon source plays a significant role in inducing somatic embryo development in certain plant species. This study aimed to establish a somatic embryo maturation protocol for Batu 55 Mandarin (C. reticulata Blanco.) by examining the effect of various types of sugar and concentrations. The results showed that the type and concentration of sugar added to the medium affect the somatic embryo maturation of Batu 55 Mandarin. Galactose and maltose enhance somatic embryo maturation more effectively than does sorbitol. The combination of galactose or maltose with sorbitol was able to improve somatic embryo maturation more effectively than galactose or maltose alone. The combination of galactose and sorbitol enhanced the maturation of somatic embryos more effectively than did change the concentrations of maltose or sorbitol. It can be concluded that sugar type and concentration had effects on citrus somatic embryo development.

Development of hypovirulent strains of fungus as biocontrol agents is very limited. This research was aimed to find hypovirulent isolates of Fusarium from field as biological agents. A hundred isolates of Fusarium from chili were collected in Boyolali, Central Java. Morphological characterization revealed that isolates performed varied colony phenotypes. Based on colony phenotype pattern, isolates were classified into five groups. From each group, one hypovirulent isolate was selected based on colony growth rate on potato dextrose agar media. The selected hypovirulent isolates were used for virulence assay in apple. The result showed that there were four hypovirulent isolates i.e.: B6, C15, D19, and E20 isolates. Total RNA extraction of the identified hypovirulent isolates revealed the existence of viral RNA in C15 isolate. Based on the existence of viral RNA in C15 isolate, the hypovirulent traits were due to mycoviral infection, whereas the hypovirulent traits performed by the other three were due to genetic factors. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The purpose of this research was to develop such a model to fit the height growth of corn (Zea mays) plant given microbial combination of Ochrobactrum sp.and Bacillus megatirium treatment; besides, to compare the plant absolute growth rate model between plant with microbial and non microbial treatment. A simple sigmoid model was preffered as it is easier to interpret the parameters biologically. The result showed that Logistic model fitted better in describing the height growth compared to Gompertz model, as it yielded coefficient of determination more than 99%. This model showed that the maximum height growth rate happened in about 40 day after planting. Based on the model, it showed that the absolute growth rate tended to be bell-shaped and right-skewed for Logistic and Gompertz, respectively. © 2013, Universitas Brawijaya.","Corn; Gompertz; Height; Logistic; Microbe","Ochrobactrum; Zea mays","Wardhani, W.S.; University of Brawijaya, Jl.

One of the conditions from the forest authoritiesfor allowing agroforestry system is that it should maintain forest conditions. Since 1995 the Jangkok watershed has undergone rapid land use change, especially in the forest area. These changes led to a reduction of carbon stocks and thus to emission of CO2. This research aimed to: (1) Measure the carbon stocks in several land use system within the Jangkok watershed, (2) Assess the contribution of agroforestry systems in maintaining carbon stocks and reducing emissions. The assesment was performed based on the RaCSA (Rapid Carbon Stock Appraisal) method using three phases: (1) Classify land use change applying TM5 Landsat Satellite images for the period 1995-2009, (2) Measure carbon stock in the main land uses identified, (3) Quantify the contribution of agroforestry practices. Results showed that (1) The total amount of carbon stock at Jangkok watershed (19,088ha) was 3.69 Mt (193 Mg ha-1); about 23% of this stock found in the agroforestry systems (32% of the area),(2) Gross CO2 emission from the Jangkok watershed was 8.41 Mg ha-1 yr-1, but due to the net gain in agroforestry of 2.55 Mg ha-1 yr-1 the net emission became 5.86 Mg ha-1 yr-1.","Agroforestry; Carbon emission rate; Carbon stocks",,"Markum; University of Mataram, Jl.

Twenty seven accessions collected from various regions of Indonesia were planted in the field and evaluated for their morphological traits, and RAPD analyzed for their molecular markers. The UPGMA clustering analyzes, elaborating the combination of morphological and molecular data, indicated that the tomato accessions could be grouped into 5 major groups with 70 % genetic similarity levels. Current study indicated that although many accessions came from different locations, they congregated into the same group. Cherry, Kudamati 1 and Lombok 3 were the farthest genetic distant accessions to the others. Those three genotypes will be the most valuable accessions, when they were crossed with other accessions, for designing a prospective breeding program in the future. © 2017 Universitas Brawijaya.","Genetic diversity; Morphology; RAPD marker; Tomato; UPGMA",,"Herison, C.; Department of Agronomy, Faculty of Agriculture, University of BengkuluIndonesia; email: herisoncatur@unib.ac.id",,"Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University",01260537,,,,"English","Agrivita",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038264258

Seventy eight sunflower RILs were grown in greenhouse and 100 sunflower RILs were grown under field condition, and measured some morphological and physiological traits including leaf area at flowering (LAf), net CO2 assimilation rate (A) and transpiration per day at flowering (Ef). WUE, called “potential” WUE (WUEp), was calculated as the ratio of assimilation potential (Ap) to transpiration per day at flowering (Ef) where Ap was derived from the multiplication of A with LAf. The CID was significantly varied among RILs and there was significant negative genetic correlation between CID and WUEp. Heritability of the CID was higher rather than the WUEp which reflected wide genetic variability of CID. The genetic correlation between CID and WUEp and the wide genotypic variability of CID indicated that CID can be proposed as an indicator to determine WUE in sunflower and open a way in understanding the genetic diversity of the RILs which could be used as a basic consideration before applying selection program in sunflower breeding. © 2017 Universitas Brawijaya.","CID; Genotypic variability; Sunflower; WUE",,"Adiredjo, A.L.; Department of Agronomy, Faculty of Agriculture, Universitas BrawijayaIndonesia; email: al.adiredjo@ub.ac.id",,"Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University",01260537,,,,"English","Agrivita",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038218811

For both allometric models, the uncertainties of the individual tree biomass estimation caused by the use of a specific allometric model were also calculated. Finally, the overall uncertainty of individual tree biomass by combining the two uncertainties was calculated. The allometric model including tree height was 6 % more accurate than that excluding tree height when the uncertainty caused by allometric models became the only consideration. However, in terms of the uncertainty caused by measurement, the allometric model excluding tree height was three times more accurate than allometric model including tree height. As a result, the allometric model excluding tree height was 5 % more accurate than the allometric model including tree height when both causes of uncertainty, the allometric model and measurement errors were considered.

The research was aimed to evaluate the susceptibility of several maize genotypes including local variety to the maize weevil. Six genotypes i.e. SJA, G10-12-20, G10-1-3, G10-1-7, G10-1-20 and G10-1-17 and Tosari as local variety were used. No-choice assay under laboratory condition with observed variables was laid an egg and F1 progeny number, the median time of development and weight loss of infested kernel. The susceptibility index was assessed using Dobie’s susceptibility index. Results showed that the number of eggs laid by five females and infested samples weight loss were not significantly different between six maize genotypes as well as local variety. In contrast, the number of F1 progeny emerged was significantly different. Based on the susceptibility index, the maize genotype of G10-1-3 and G10-1-17 were resistant to the weevil. While other maize genotypes and local variety were considered as moderate resistant. Based on analysis of chemical and physical characteristic revealed that maize genotypes with higher of the total phenolic compound and physical hardness tend to resist from weevil damaged. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

This study was conducted to investigate the consequences of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas on post-harvest quality and shelf life of tomato fruits during the modified atmosphere packaging storage. Tomato fruits of light red maturity stage were harvested at Gangwon province in the Republic of Korea. Fruits were dipped in fungal suspension and, afterward, some of them were sterilized with NaOCl, while others were sterilized with ClO gas. On the final storage day, the 5 ppm ClO2 gas 12 hours treated tomato fruits showed the least carbon dioxide and ethylene, and the utmost oxygen concentration. The least fresh weight loss, prolonged shelf life and the most suppressed fungal incidence were obtained by the 5 ppm ClO2 gas 12 hours treatment. As compared to other treatments, the 5 ppm ClO2 gas 12 hours treatment yielded higher firmness, titratable acidity and vitamin C, and lower soluble solids. Therefore, the 5 ppm ClO2 gas 12 hours treatment may be useful to prevent fungal incidence as well as to retain the postharvest quality and increase the shelf life of tomato fruits. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Extraction of oviposition deterrent was conducted by maceration method. The preference test was performed using two arms olfactometer, meanwhile the oviposition deterrent test was conducted by exposed gravid females to fruit that already smeared with extracts. The result revealed that gravid females of B. carambolae were attracted to methanol extract of 1 day after egg deposition, whereas the methanol extract of 3 and 5 days after egg deposition repelled gravid females. Oviposition deterrent test indicated that methanol extract at category 3 and 5 acted as a deterrent. The preference of gravid females of B. carambolae to different category of infested fruit extracts was probably influenced by the chemicals modification on mango after oviposition.

The objectives of this study were to assess the genetic diversity and the population structure of PN'81 populations and the Wickham clones using 15 EST-SSR loci. Results of the analysis showed that the evaluated SSR primers yielded polymorphic markers. The gSSR 268 primer pairs yielded the most informative markers while HBE 280 primers generated the lowest ones. Results of the genetic diversity analysis supported that the PN'81 population belonged to a single large natural population of rubber trees while the Wickham clones belonged to a different group than that of PN'81. The population structure analysis of the rubber accessions was also in agreement with the results of the genetic diversity analysis.

The controlled cross-pollination in sweetpotato faces issues due to its cross-incompatibility and self-incompatibility characteristics. Currently, the in-compatibility level in sweetpotato is investigated based on the fruit set percentage. However, this criterion lacks the ability in accurately predicting the number of new clones. Therefore, it is essential to study new parameters to create a better inves-tigation of incompatibility in sweetpotato. The materials used in this research consisted of eight sweetpotato clones as female and four sweet-potato clones as male parents. Cross-pollinations were done reciprocally. The experiment was conducted at Indonesian Legume and Tuber Crops Research Institute from April to December 2014. The result showed that totally 5,188 times crossing produced about 25% fruit sets and 10% normal seedlings. The use of normal seedlings percentage as a new parameter in evaluating cross-pollination has apparently seemed to be more effective than the fruit sets percentage method because numbers of new clones could be known accurately. This research revealed that the normal seedling could be used as a new parameter in determining the incompatibility level in sweetpotato controlled cross-pollination. ï¿½ 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Breeding varieties specifically for their resistance to BLB disease is therefore an efficient and cost-effective strategy. However, the resistance gene for BLB can be race and non-race specific, meaning it is often overcome by the pathogen. The identification of new sources of resistance genes for Xoo is crucial in rice breeding programmes. In this study, six rice varieties were assessed using six Xoo isolates in multiple screening conditions. The GGE biplot analysis considers both genotype (G) and genotype environment (GE) interaction effects and demonstrates GE interaction. The first two principal components (PCs) accounted for 95.46% of the total GE variation in the data. Based on lesion length and stability performance, Phaladum was the most ideal genotype against all Xoo isolates in the four screening conditions. The results relayed that Phaladum indigenous rice varieties could be considered as new sources of bacterial leaf blight resistance in Thailand. In the future, the BLB resistance gene in this variety will be identified in regard to mode of inheritance and used as parental line in rice breeding programmes for resistance to BLB. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Twenty eight SSR marker loci yielded monomorphic allele pattern and indicated that the evaluated accessions probably were all genetically homogeneous for the respective loci. Eight RAPD and 4 ISSR primers out of the total 31 tested primers produced scoreable markers and some (i.e. UBC 873, OPG 17, OPP 03 and OPQ 11 primers) generated polymorphics markers. Genetic similarity coefficiens among evaluated accessions ranged from 0.6 to 1.0 with a population mean of 0.9 indicating low diversity and narrow genetic background among accessions in all populations. Therefore, breeding program utilizing such population would only result in low genetic gain. Based on the evaluated SCAR markers, all accessions belonged to the non-toxic Mexican type of physic nut. This information is important inputs for designing future physic nut breeding strategies in Indonesia. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The goals of this research were to determine the impact of four wild plants on three cash corps, focusing on the diversity and abundance of insect pollinators, and to test the efficacy of this scheme using farmland on the northern slope of Mount Slamet. This research was done using a split block design, with the three cash crops as blocks (strawberry [Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne], chili pepper [Capsicum spp.], and tomatoes [Solanum lycopersicum L.]) and four wild plant species as treatments (Cleome rutidosperma, Borreria laevicaulis, Euphorbia heterophylla, and Tridax procumbens) at different precentages (0, 5, 10, and 15 %) of cash crop plant density. The results show that growing wild plants with cash crops enhanced the abundance and diversity of insect pollinators. Moreover, the addition of wild plant species to the crops at four densities had significantly different effects on insect pollinators in terms of abundance and diversity. The com-bination of 15 % C. rutidospermae and tomatoes had the largest population of insect pollinators. From the experiments it concluded that an AES could be implemented in farmland on the northern slope of Mount Slamet. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The production process was arranged in a paired treatment; a combination of PGPR and antagonist fungi (without supplemental chemical fertilizers and fungicide), furtherly called biofungicide and common farmer practices. The results showed that the application of biofungicide promoted equal plant growth quality as common practices. White rust incidency was lower at biofungicide treatment sites, thus increased the markertable flowers quantity. The production cost was considered more efficient in biofungicide sites, due to cheaper price of biofungicide than chemical fertilizers and fungicide.

In each season 10 samples, 6 from conventionally cultivated soil (CCS) and 4 from organic fertilized soil (OFS), were collected from 10 randomly selected sampling points. The study observed acidic soil pH in all three cropping seasons, while soil pH was decreasing gradually with fertilizer application. The results of the study clearly depicted that all the soil nutrient contents and OM decreased with the application of fertilizers in different cropping seasons except Zn and Fe. The OFS contains relatively higher amount of OM and essential nutrients than CCS except Fe and Zn.

This field research objectives was to find out the corn crop cultivation in August 2014 which entered dry season. The iinstallation of subsurface drainage that previously had functioned as water discharge was converted into water retention. The research results showed that corn had grown well during peak dry season period (October) in which water table was at –50 cm below soil surface, whereas water table depth was dropped to –70 cm below soil surface in land without subsurface drainage. This condition implied that installation of subsurface drainage at dry season had function as water retention, not as water discharge. Therefore, network function was inverted from water discharge into water retention. It had impact on the development of optimum water surface that flow in capillary mode to fulfill the crop’s water requirement. Corn production obtained was 6.4 t ha-1. This condition was very promising though still below the maximum national production. The aapplications of subsurface drainage was still not optimumum due to the supply of water from the main system was not the same because of the soil physical properties diversity and topography differences. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications was used in each location. The results showed that grains yields were affected by locations, seasons, and genotypes. The genotypes x locations x seasons interaction effect was significant; therefore, the best hybrid was different for each location and season. A7/PK36 hybrid has the best performance in Batang during the dry season, while A7/PK40 and A7/PK32 are the best hybrids in the rainy season. In Sukamandi, nine hybrids were identified as better yielder than that of the check cultivar in the dry season, but not so in the rainy season.

Synthetic insecticide is not effective to control thrips and produce residual effect on crops. Insecticidal residue is dangerous for human, natural enemies and environment widely. Therefore, it is necessary to find an alternative thrips pest control on strawberries, through integrated pest manage-ment (IPM) implementation. Research was aimed to determine the effect of IPM technology for Thrips sp. on strawberry plantation. Research was conducted on strawberry plantation by comparing IPM and conventional plots, in Kusuma Agrowisata Batu from April to July 2009. Variables were used such as the number of larvae, adult population and damage intensity caused by Thrips sp., and fruit production. Data was analyzed by t-test on 5%. The results showed that the average larva and adult population of Thrips sp. on IPM plot were higher than conventional plot, 1.12 and 0.50 for larva and 0.87 and 0.27 for adults respectively. The damage intensity of strawberry crops on IPM plot was higher than conventional plot, 11.69 and 5.98% respectively.

Local Rote is a well-known local groundnut variety in ENT, which is a potential superior variety and parental source due its large seed size and high yielding ability. Information on its resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses is important for its future development. Five groundnut genotypes, Local Rote and check varieties were elucidated to identify drought resistant genotypes. The study was carried out in a split-plot design with three replicates in two locations during dry season 2013. Two irrigation regimes (optimum and stress conditions) were assigned as main plot and 5 groundnut geno-types as sub-plot. Research results revealed significant effect of irrigation by genotype interaction on observed yield and yield compo-nent characters in both locations.

The first activity for evaluating a salinity stress, consisted of four levels of soil salinity (EC): 0.9; 4; 7; 10 dS m-1 and eleven genotypes. The second one to obtain information about changes in physiological and morphological characteristics of soybean affected by salinity stress. The second activity consisted of two soil salinity levels (EC): 1.52 dS m-1 and 8.58 dS m-1. The results showed that at salinity 10 dS m-1, all varieties/genotypes were not able to survive until the age of 43 days after sowing (DAS). At salinity 4 dS m-1, total plant dry weight of most genotypes soybean decreased by 48.14%, while the salinity of 7 dS m-1 total plant dry weight of all soybean decreased by 64.89%. Concentration of K and Na in soybean leaves were higher than those in soybean root tissue. The content of K and Na in leaves and roots of most soybean genotypes increased as soil salinity increased from 1.52 to 8.58 dS m-1, except for genotype G11. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Salinity tolerance of tomato germplasms was evaluated with respect to severity of leaf symptoms, shoot and root dry matter production, shoot Na+, K+, Ca2+ accumulation and their respective ratio. The salinity tolerance scale ranges from 1.00 (most tolerant) to 3.50 (most sensitive). Based on the severity of leaf symptoms caused by the NaCl treatment “BT14 (BARI Tomato 14)” and “BHT5 (BARI Hybrid Tomato 5)” were found the most tolerant germplasms to salinity with score 1.0. Reduction of dry weight was found to be 19% (shoot) and 15% (root) in BT14 and BHT5, 30-76% (shoot) and 27-83% (root) in other germplasms when salinity was added. Higher correlation was found between salinity tolerance scale classes and the reduction of shoot/root dry weight, Na+ concentration, K+/Na+, and Ca2+/Na+ ratios. Thus, “BT14” and “BHT5” can be regarded as a breeding material for development of new tomato varieties for tolerance to salinity. © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Following treatment to replicated plots in standard experimental design, data were collected at harvest for yield quantity and quality. Ginseng plants treated both pre-harvest and a combination of pre- and post-harvest showed market grade increases of 33.3% and 40.0%, respectively. Point of sale gross return for this crop is dependent upon tuber quality, and from these data the economics of these treatments were calculated. Based on stand adjusted yields and quality values, a combination of pre- and post-harvest treatment increased gross income by 57.4%. The second crop showed similar trends in positive responses. In the two blueberry varieties studied, Emerald treated plants showed 96% statistical increase in yield, while Jewel showed 31% increase. At the time of treatment, each variety was in a different stage of flowering. The Emerald variety was in the flowering stage, and Jewel was predominately in the fruiting stage. Both treated cultivars however demonstrated increased yield quantity and quality. The specific mechanisms that lead to these preliminary results need further investigation.","Biofield Treatment; Blueberry; Crop Yield; Ginseng","Panax ginseng; Vaccinium","Patil, S.; Trivedi Foundation, 15111 Hayden Road Suite 160 #305, Scottsdale, AZ 85260, United States; email: shrikant@trivedifoundation.org",,,01260537,,,,"English","Agrivita",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878980022
