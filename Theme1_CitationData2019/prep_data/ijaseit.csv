Globalization and pressure from stakeholder demand the operation of the supply chain to give attention to the environment effect, community, economic and intangibility assets. SHSCPM is feasibly developed for measuring the performance of simultaneous sustainability aspects and intangibility assets to meet customer satisfaction. This article discusses SHSCPM based on the balanced scorecard (BSC) with attention to the sustainability aspects, intangibility assets and relationships between the performance of perspectives and indicators. The perspectives and indicators of performance were identified by literature and the confirmed and validated by the survey to 7 expert respondents. We found 5 perspectives and 39 indicators from literature which were then confirmed to expert through a survey with an in-depth interview. From a survey that validated with a weighted average (WA) and level of consensus (LC), we found 31 valid indicators. Finally, 29 indicators from DEMATEL process were selected to be used on SHSCPM. The DEMATEL process found 2 indicators aren't important and influence for other, namely inventory cost and regulations and laws. Besides, the four results on this study: intangibility indicators incorporated on innovation and growth were most affect to other indicators which the intangibility indicators were related with human resource, indicators on customer perspective were most important compared to other indicators, indicators on economic aspect were most important compared indicators on environmental and social aspects, and indicators on social aspect were not affected by other indicators. After that, human resource and customer were main factors for SHSCPM. Finally, relationships between perspectives and indicators used to design of BSC strategy map. © Advanced Science Engineering Information Technology. 2018.","Balanced scorecard; DEMATEL; Level of consensus; SHSCPM; Weighted average",,"Leksono, E.B.; Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Muhammadiyah Gresik, Jl.

Public transport ridership considers a decision based on the utility value of gains and losses which can be modeled by using mental accounting theory. The objective of this research is to investigate the dynamic of internal reference points for public transport ridership after implementing transport policies. It describes the decision of travelers' behavior when facing the dynamic value of the utility, whether it is increasing, decreases or stable. In this study, a traveler's behavior model based on mental accounting theory was developed. The result showed that the public transport ridership's are more likely to change their reference point when realizing gains than losses for transport policies. Furthermore, the way of public transport ridership combines the decrease and increase of the utility value showed that travelers tend to consider which gains and losses occurred simultaneously. Therefore, the integration outcome is more desirable than segregation outcomes, and revealed that mental accounting theory plays a major role in public transport ridership.

In this study, the extraction process, also known as distillation, is conducted by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in West Pasaman, Indonesia. Patchouli oil must go through several steps before being by manufacturers, such as farmers, intermediaries, collectors. The interview and survey conducted show that SMEs are currently declining in West Pasaman due to the low selling price of patchouli oil while the production cost is high that declined farmers. Most traders do not add value to the product as they only collect patchouli oil and pass it on to next stages. This study aims to determine the production cost and profit margin of each stage in the supply chain of patchouli oil. Data were collected by interviewing the stakeholders, i.e., patchouli farmers, SMEs refining patchouli oil, collectors, and exporters. The production cost determined using traditional costing method. The results indicate that farmers obtain IDR 1.236 per day, while traders and collectors obtain respectively IDR 10.000 and IDR 3.833 a day.

The characteristic of rendang is the umami taste which is a mixture of salty, sweet and spicy flavor that harmonizes with each other. The main ingredients in the manufacture of rendang are meat, coconut milk, and spices. Spices used in rendang are red chili, red onion, garlic, turmeric, galangal, coriander, lemongrass, ginger, candlenut, bay leaf, turmeric leaves and orange leaves. The use of these spices can improve the aroma and distinctive taste of rendang. The purpose of this study was to identify the sensory characteristics of rendang products from various regions in West Sumatra. The method used to analyze rendang sensory characteristics is Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA) which uses trained panelists on the test. QDA consist of panelist training, Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and sensory testing of rendang products. There are 11 attributes identified by the panelists on rendang are obtained from FGD, they are blackish color and aroma (oil, roasted coconut, umami, aroma of meat and smoke), and taste (sweet, salty, spicy, umami and bitter). The results of QDA test were analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The PCA identified four major components that accounted for 99.3% of the variation of sensory data. Sensory profiling shows the correlation between each attribute and the sample of rendang indicating that the rendang is spread over four quadrants. Rendang from Bukittinggi is found in the first quadrant and characterized by the aroma of fishy, the taste of salt and sweet. Rendang from Pariaman, Sawahlunto, and Tanah Datar / Batusangkar are found in the second quadrant characterized by umami aroma, spicy flavors, umami taste and aroma of the oil. Rendang from Padang is in the third quadrant and characterized by the aroma of roasted coconut and black color. Rendang from Payakumbuh contained in the fourth quadrant characterized by the aroma of smoke and bitter taste. Based on the evaluation of sensory characteristics performed using PCA, it can be concluded that the new sensory characteristics (the result of a reduction of eleven sensory attributes analyzed) on rendang products in various areas in West Sumatra can be distinguished by four attributes: aroma, cooking time, spices and flavors. This is the first systematic study on profiling of sensory attributes of rending using a standard sensory method. © IJASEIT.","Principal component analysis (PCA); Profiling; Quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA); Rendang; Sensory",,"Nazir, N.; Laboratory of Sensory and Quality Control, Faculty of Agricultural Technology, Andalas UniversityIndonesia; email: nazir_novizar@ae.unand.ac.id",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

This casting technique, develop shell mould fabrication by coating the required pattern with a refractory mixture which offers the complex geometrical shape and sizes parts to be cast. However, the modern IC approach in shell mould production suffers from zircon's cost and supply instability as it is the main material to be used. Zircon uses as refractory filler for slurry production, and also in the form of sand used as stucco particles, is favoured by the investment casting facilities and industries as it exhibits the most versatile properties such as low thermal expansion and low reactivity to the metal to be cast. During the period of zircon supply shortage, many facilities introduce several alternatives. Currently, the step taken to reduce the cost of primary slurry material is by using some alternate refractory material like, alumina, silica, to be used with zircon for shell mould production. In relation to that, several researches continue to search for alternatives approach for shell mould materials. This research introduces the alternative method in fabricating investment casting shell mould as recognized from investment casting industry located in Sungai Puar of Bukittingi Padang Indonesia. This industry employs several local resources to fabricate the shell mould. These materials consist of rice husk ash (RHA), and two types of bentonite clays. The bentonite clays were obtained nearly from Kota Payakumbuh in the western provinces. However, this industry suffers from weak shell mould strength and need to be investigated and consulted. In this paper, the investigation on shell mould strength made from rice husk ash (RHA), and bentonite clays were conducted. The strength was measured by its modulus of rupture (MOR) performed in 3 points flexural bending test. The green and fired shell mould strength was determined from five type of slurry composition. The results revealed that the highest green and fired strength obtained were 0.157 MPa and 0.361 MPa from shell mould sample C of RHA (46%) and bentonite (54%) of its composition. © Advanced Science Engineering Information Technology. 2018.","Bentonite clay; Modulus of rupture; Rice husk ash (RHA)",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Development in intelligence monitoring systems for agricultural application have unfold the possibility to observe individual plant response upon receiving external stimuli. In this study, artificial Bio-pores, 30 cm in diameter, were introduced to the ranges of oil palm trees in three commercial plantations. Various applications methods of Bio-pores, in particular depths and numbers per plant were investigated. The Bio-pores drilled around the root zone of the trees using an earth auger, and filled with chopped semi-decomposed fronds and midribs from the plantation maintenance (pruning). A robotic quadcopter drone with 2.7K camera, operated with pre-set flight-plan, employed to record the crown image of oil palm trees under observation. The drone flown at the altitude of 23±0.1 meters above the crown, recording each crown individually. Focus and setting of drone's cameras was set to automatic, enabling unbiased image recording. The weather conditions (sun radiation, cloud covering, wing speed) upon images recording were measured and recorded. When recording the images, the drone's GPS-assisted hovering system maintained its position in both axes (horizontal and vertical), producing identical image acquisition for each crown. All plants' crown was observed at 0, 30, 60, and 120 days after Bio-pores introduced. Image processing software was developed to segment and extract vegetation index (Vis) information from the images. Plants' morphological conditions (height, radial, and new leaf) were measured and analyse by statistical methods to understand various Bio-pores applications influences to plants development. Crown images were processed, and its features extracted and correlated with chlorophyll in leaves. Models developed to predict chlorophyll contents (A, B, and Total) in crown and Vis analyses methods were used to compare individual plant responding to this external stimulus by means of rotational-pivot charts. Results showed that intensive Bio-pores introduction promote plant's radial development and the emergence of new leaves. Furthermore, chlorophylls contents in leaves of plants with substantial Bio-pores applications were greater compared to normal plants. Models showed that optical features extracted from crown images obtained high coefficient of correlation (R2) with leaves chlorophyll contents.

In this situation, damage process in concrete is mainly caused by chloride ingress. The chloride penetrates into the concrete by various mechanisms. For concrete submerged in seawater, the chloride solution penetrates into the concrete trough diffusion mechanism and cause damage over the time. However, in real life, reinforced concrete structure mostly placed in the partially saturated area and subjected to the repeated actions of the wetting and drying cycle. This condition makes the concrete structures more vulnerable to corrosion than structures in a fully saturated condition. Therefore, this study investigates the changes in concrete microstructures condition due to repeated actions of wetting and drying. The samples were exposed by 5% NaCl solution through the different configuration of wet and dry duration. The microstructural condition was observed by several methods such as XRF, SEM and EDX analysis. Major constituent phases of concrete and the differences in their distribution due to different duration of wet and dry were observed in this study. Finally, from the investigation, it was found that there were noticeable differences in chloride and magnesium percentage in the samples. This result acts as evidence that the duration of wet and dry can affect the formation of particular compounds such as chloroaluminate, quartz, brucite, and dolomite in the samples which plays roles in the damage process of concrete. © IJASEIT.","Cyclic wetting; Drying; Microstructural; Reinforced concrete",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Evaluation between atmospheric and vacuum operating pressure showed that the latter could give better product quality by avoiding the product from cracking or destructed due to too high operating temperature when the operating pressure was atmospheric (1 bar). The preferred vacuum pressure was 0.05 bar which resulted in the maximum temperature at the bottom stream of distillation column was about 335°C, lower than a maximum allowable temperature which was 350°C.

The accuracy of the location estimation from nodes is important parameter in tracking system. However, many various attacks try to manipulate the estimated location or try to provide false nodes data transmission. The secure and privacy data sharing of the estimation is also become another priority in WSN. Hence, this paper focuses on employing secure wireless object tracking (SWOT) system which is added by the reliable method in privacy data sharing. By proposing the transmission system based cryptographic mechanism, some parameter data that are required in estimated calculation such as RSSI, coordinates, pathloss exponent (PLE), and estimated distance will be hidden using encryption process. Due to the limited computational device, we propose security scheme without raising computational capability. Layered encryption using AES 128, RSA 2048, MD5 and SHA-1 provide high performance authentication and data encryption services for each nodes. Implementing mobile cooperative tracking scenario refers to previous work, the proposed security scheme is efficient in terms of processing time which could not influenced to the estimated location accuracy. Moreover, the authentication protocol which is adopted from one time password scenario can apply the key renewal mechanism for AES 128 and MD5 algorithm. The experimental results show that SWOT system achieves 75.95 ms processing time using Raspberry Pi devices including trilateration algorithm and security process.

This has resulted in fly ash being used as a partial replacement of cement and in various composites, for civil and mining industries. Recent studies and applications have shown the viability of fly ash as an economical and eco-friendly stabiliser for dump slopes in opencast mines. Apart from the analysis of structural stability due to the pozzolanic binding nature of fly ash, it is also important to study the hydrological aspects of dump slopes in conjugation with the fly ash stabiliser. This study performs the numerical simulation for the dump slopes using finite element analysis (FEA) for studying the effect of fly ash stabilisation layer on water movement and associated hydrological investigation. The effect of water head build-up (due to fly ash stabilisation layer) on the overall stability of dump slope is analysed and compared to give an estimate for the increase in a factor of safety of slope and a viable dimensional increase of slope geometry. It is seen that fly ash layer stabilisation is effective even in the saturated state of overburden dumps, with the factor of safety increasing from 1.09 to 1.32. Proper drainage channels are found to be essential to prevent any excess stress build-up due to the low permeability of fly ash layers. © IJASEIT.","Composites; Dump stabilisation; Finite element analysis; Fly ash; Hydrological analysis",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Continuous research is going on for detecting breast cancer in its early stage as the possibility of cure is very high in the early stage. The two main objectives of this work were: firstly, to compare the performance of k-means and fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithms; and secondly, to make an attempt to carefully consider and examine, from multiple points of view, the combination of different computational measures for k-means and FCM algorithms for a potential to achieve better clustering accuracy. K-means and FCM algorithms have been considered to understand the impact of clustering on the breast cancer data. The execution of k-means algorithm is based on centroid, distance, split method, threshold, epoch, attributes, and number of iterations; while FCM is executed on the basis of fuzziness value and termination condition. The breast cancer Wisconsin (BCW) dataset was used for the experimentation and the comparison. The combination of variance and same centroid offers better outcome in terms of k-means algorithm. The highest and lowest clustering accuracies are (94.7%, 77.1%) and (94.4%, 88.5%) for foggy and random centroid, respectively. The overall average positive prediction accuracy obtained by this approach is approximately 92%. In case of FCM, the highest and lowest clustering accuracies are (97.2%, 91.1%), (97.2%, 90.9%), (97.8%, 90.4%), and (97.1%, 90.2%) for different combination of fuzziness and termination criteria. The average highest and lowest clustering accuracies are (95.7%, 94.7%), (95.9%, 93.6%), (95.3%, 94.2%), and (95.6%, 93.7%) for the same combination in the case of FCM. K-means algorithm was more prominent and consistent in terms of computation time as FCM required more time to carry out several fuzzy calculations and iterations. The findings of this work provide an incisive and extensive understanding of the computational parameters used with k-means and FCM algorithms. The computational results indicate that FCM algorithm was found to be prominent and consistent than k-means algorithm when executed with different iterations, fuzziness values, and termination criteria. It is more potentially capable in clustering BCW dataset as the clustering accuracy is more important than time. © Advanced Science Engineering Information Technology. 2018.","Breast cancer; Breast cancer Wisconsin dataset; Fuzzy c-means; K-means",,"Dubey, A.K.; Institute of Engineering and Technology, JK Lakshmipat University, Near Mahindra SEZ, Ajmer Road, India; email: ashutoshdubey123@gmail.com",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

As such, activity recognition is purposely incorporated in the smart system to detect simple and complex events that happen in the building. In all existing event detections, the complex event processing (CEP) approach has been used for the detection of complex events. The CEP is capable of abstracting meaningful events from various and heterogeneous data sources, filtering and processing both simple and complex events, as well as, producing fast mitigation action based on specific scenarios.

This research used field survey method. Soil samples were taken in the field and then analyzed in the laboratory using the membrane plate apparatus for assessment of the filed capacity and the permanent wilting. This research aimed to obtain data about water retention variability of Andisols in oil palm plantation of peasants on various age levels of oil palm in Pasaman sub-district, West Sumatera. The advantage of this research was to find out the effect of different age levels of oil palm on soil water retention and other physical soil properties in Andisols. This research identified water retention of the soil was between 21.2-42.7% volume with the bulk density (BD) was between 0.31-0.83 g/cc. The results showed that there is no significant difference between the oil palm ages (5-10 years, 10-15 years, and above 15 years) on either the soil water retention or the soil bulk density for both the topsoil (0-20 cm) and the subsoil (20-40 cm). This research indicated that there is no effect of the oil palm age on the soil bulk density, field capacity, permanent wilting point, and plant available water. This research suggested that the soil should be saturated with high water content since West Sumatera has very high rainfall intensity so that the situation can be an advantage for oil palm growth over the years. © Advanced Science Engineering Information Technology. 2018.","Andisols; Available water; Oil palm; Soil water retention",,"Rusman, B.; Departement of Soil Science, Faculty of Agriculture, University AndalasIndonesia; email: bujang.rusman@yahoo.com",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The study is done through bibliometrics, using a kind of descriptive, documentary research; with a non-experimental, and transversal design. The population is finite and represented by papers, conference proceedings, and thesis published between 2005-2014. To collect the primary data was used the direct observation technique, through concept analysis. We conclude, based on the results, generally, enterprises use the paradigm of fixed capital, focus on relational capital, while in universities the paradigms changed to the dynamic, Newtonian, integrating and transformational intellectual capital, based on human capital. Additionally, that as much as in the universities as in the enterprises the intellectual capital improved the performance of the organization, thus, the revision of the literature states that the results generated by the effective management of the intellectual capital are sustained in the time because of its immaterial nature. Moreover, in the enterprises, the predominant components correspond to the relational capital such as clients, suppliers, strategic alliances and the company reputation in front of the clients, which are essential for the generation of knowledge and the development of innovation. © IJASEIT.","Comparative view; Enterprises; Intellectual capital; Universities",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Civet coffee is produced from the coffee beans which have been digested by Asian palm civet or Luwak (Paradoxorus hermaprodites). Civet coffee production is very limited due to its processing is merely depends on civet biologic system. Unfortunately, reliable information on civet microbial digestive is still limited. The aim of this research is to evaluate cup (sensory) and microbial quality of wild and caged civet coffee. Samples of wild and caged civet coffee obtained from Bener Meriah District, Aceh, Indonesia. Sensory quality parameters consist of fragrance, aroma, flavour, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance, uniformity, clean cups, sweetness and overall. Microbial quality was done by enumeration of lactic acid bacteria. The results showed that wild and caged civet coffee relatively had similar profile sensory and microbial characteristics. The score cupping of wild civet coffee is slightly higher than caged civet coffee. Aroma and flavour characteristics of wild and caged civet coffee were herby, nutty, grassy tobacco-like, fishy and sweet but there were over fruity-papaya and guava-like aroma and flavour of caged civet coffee. The lactic acid bacteria count on wild and caged civet were 5.8 × 108 cfu/ml and 3,8 × 108 cfu/ml. Three different colonies from MRS media were isolated and submitted to gram and catalase test. All isolates showed gram-positive and catalase negative. The result confirmed that most colonies are lactic acid bacteria group.

To ensure the seeds are cleaned from any foreign seeds, it is very important to develop a low cost and simple mechanism to classify the seeds according to its varieties. The use of a flatbed scanner is one of the alternative techniques for image acquisition of the seeds varieties. This study was carried out to evaluate morphological features of local rice seed varieties developed for Malaysian rice industry using image processing techniques. Image of four seed varieties, mainly are MR219, MR220, MR263, and MR269 were acquired and extracted using a normal desktop flatbed scanner. A LabVIEW program was developed to extract four main morphology features which are length, width, aspect ratio and rectangular aspect ratio. The extracted data were analysed in terms of its spread and variability. One-way ANOVA was done to compare the means of the morphological features. Further t-test analyses were done to distinguish between two seed varieties based on the variation in the morphological features of the seed kernel. The results indicated that seed length parameter extracted from the image acquired by the flatbed scanner is significant to differentiate the cultivated rice seed except for MR269 and MR220. Seed width can be used as a parameter to distinguish MR269 and MR220 pair.

The study investigates a stiffness, strength and energy dissipation of the damper under loading. For this purpose, a U-shaped hysteresis steel damper is modeled and analyzed by a nonlinear finite element technique which involves both geometrical and material nonlinearities. The model is subjected to a monotonic increasing load which is applied horizontally until one cycle of hysteresis is formed. The stiffness, strength, and energy dissipation of the damper is directly determined from the graph of load-displacement. Feasibility of the hysteresis damper is investigated further for application on building construction. The damper is placed on the roof and supporting structure of the building. A 2-DOF spring-mass model, as a simple modelling of the building is introduced with damper's properties are taken from the results of the first study. A seismic load is applied to see the response of the model. The static numerical analysis showed that the properties of the introduced damper, such as stiffness, strength and energy dissipation, are depending on the geometry of the damper. The results show that reducing the length of lower plate or height of the damper will increase stiffness, strength and energy absorption. In contrary, reducing the width of the damper will decrease all properties. Moreover, the results of the dynamic analysis show the feasibility of damper to reduce to reduce the amplitudes of the response of the roof under seismic load. © Advanced Science Engineering Information Technology. 2018.","Dynamic response; Energy dissipation; Finite element; Hysteresis damper; Stiffness; Strength",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The rock unit in the investigated area is described as the Calcarenite Member of the Pamutuan Formation. The present study applying detailed lithologic and paleontologic description reveals five lithologic units. Combining the field method with microscopic analysis leads to the verification of the age and environments of this carbonate rocks. The study concludes the development of reef complex in Early Mid Miocene, followed by the high energy of the dynamic environment producing the fragments of the lime clasts embedded in the packstone, indicates the deposition in the fore slope. The regression took place and moved the deposition environment to the low-energy condition at the back of the reef, producing bioclastic packstone containing larger foram. Rising seawater level amplified the dynamics of the seawater in mid-Middle Miocene. The formation of planktic packstone marked an initial transgression phase that was well-represented as regional transgressive in Southeast Asia. This phase continued until interbedded calcareous mudstone and sandstone were produced. Finally, in Late Mid Miocene the sea level regressive accumulated coarse materials of calcarenite grain size containing fragments of larger foram within shallower deposition environment. The NNW-SSE elongated distribution of five units of Calcerinite Member pointed out the configuration of Middle Miocene coastal line. In Early Middle Miocene, various carbonate rocks formation was primarily controlled by tectonic activities. Afterward, the rock deposition affected by the regional sea level rise and drop during Mid to Late Middle Miocene. The detailed description of the Calcarenite Member, therefore, contributed to the understanding of the paleogeography of Mid Miocene age and the dynamics of the environmental deposition. © IJASEIT.","Calcarenite Member; Dynamic environment; Paleo coastal line; Pamutuan Formation; Reef",,"Isnaniawardhani, V.; Faculty of Geological Engineering, Universitas Padjadjaran, Jalan Raya Bandung-Sumedang Km 21, Indonesia; email: vijaya.isnania@unpad.ac.id",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The paper focuses on the investigation of the application of lead-rubber bearings (LRBs) instead of pot bearings in a new Kutai Kartanegara steel arch bridge located in East Kalimantan province. Even though the bridge is known located in Seismic Zone 1 (the zone with the least seismic risk as per SNI 2833-2013), the study was extended for other higher risk seismic zones, namely Seismic Zones 2, 3, and 4. With the aid of Midas software, the analyses of the bridge structures were carried out and it can be concluded that the higher the seismic risk, the more effective the use of LRBs in dissipating the earthquake energy before transmitting to the bridge superstructure. The reductions of seismic base shears obtained from the analyses were between 23.10 and 44.67 percent and 17.07 and 31.47 percent in the longitudinal and transverse directions, respectively. However, the application of LRBs has a consequence of increasing the horizontal displacements of the bridge, which can be solved by introducing either larger expansion joints or passive dampers. In order to validate the seismic responses, the bridge was analyzed using Time History Analysis (THA) by imposing seven earthquake ground motions, which were scaled to a spectral design of Padang as a requirement by the Indonesian code. © IJASEIT.","Horizontal displacement; Lead rubber bearing; Seismic base shear; Seismic zone; Steel arch bridge",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Heavy rainfall at most in the dryland farming in Indonesia causes high runoff that occurred during precipitations. The huge potential of runoff can certainly be utilized as alternative water sources in the dry season to improve cropping index. The research purposes were to assess the potential of runoff farming system in improving the cropping index on dryland with wet climate. The study was conducted through observation field conditions, rainfall analysis, potential runoff analysis, crop water requirements analysis and water balance analysis in the dryland area. The result of the study indicated that peak of rainfall-runoff started in last decade of December until March. However, entering the second growing season, rainfall occurs until April only. It's implied that during the second growing season has led to a lack of water supply in the peak phase of crop water needs. Rainfall-runoff analysis indicates that surface runoff potential as an alternative source of irrigation in the dryland farming if managed well, one of which uses runoff farming system. With harvest runoff and store it for irrigation in dry season could increase the cropping index. The significant finding of this research was base on supply and demand water analysis shows that to increase cropping index of food crop in dryland with wet climate needed of catchment and cultivation area ratio (CCA ratio) equal to 6.2, to the form of catchment area was arable land with multi-cropping pattern and varies slope. © IJASEIT.","Rainfall-runoff relationship; Rainwater harvesting; Runoff harvesting; Sustainable agriculture",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Recently, an advanced high-throughput nutrient screen was used to optimise the nutrient formulation to maximise the growth of Neochloris oleoabundans under photoautotrophic condition. The screen was designed to optimise 10 nutrients via the Box-Behnken experimental design that established a screen comprising 180 media formulations matrix for microalgae cultivation (150 μL microplate-based miniature-scale cultivation system). Improved cultivation media were formulated for N. oleoabundans via the nutrient screening system. Medium formulation no. 51 and 76 (from the 180 media formulation) yielded the highest end-point OD560 of 1.319 ±0. 009 and 1.345 ±0. 023 respectively and both formulations were redesignated as medium M1 and M2 respectively for subsequent experiments. Reproducibility assessment of both media (1 L larger scale experiments) was in concordance with miniature scale data.

Regarding strength, GFRP which has high yield strength is very suitable as a reinforcement to hold the shear force. Similarly, as with steel bar, GFRP reinforcement is used as a composite material of reinforced concrete; therefore, it is worth to know the grade of the bond strength. The bond strength is one of the crucial factors to have a good interaction between GFRP and concrete in holding workloads on structures so that the study is conducted to get the grade of the bond strength of GFRP reinforcement with monolith concrete cast. The experiment is using the pullout test with a cube specimens, sized 250 mm × 250 mm × 250 mm and GFRP bar sized 25 mm diameters. Bond strength of GFRP reinforcement will then be close compared to the bond strength of BJTS40 deform rebar sized 25 mm diameters. The concrete used in this study has about f'c 100 MPa.

With reference to an actual case-based research, this article demonstrates how patient flows can be successfully optimized if Lean is not limited to single processes/contexts only, and it is applied to achieve holistic process improvement of an entire system. The complexity of healthcare delivery systems requires inclusive investigation from various points of view. This is why case-study-based research has been used to investigate dynamic, experiential and complex processes and areas, such as the ones featured by this article. The methodological basis for this research has been a twelve-step optimization approach outlined by the authors during a previous successful Lean programme. This same approach has been applied to optimize patient flows in the emergency departments of four different hospitals in Northern Italy. The research has involved teams composed of medical, nursing, technical and administrative staff. The results outlined in the article suggest that inclusive application of Lean tools leads to effective process optimization and a better working environment, when in connection with a systematic and holistic optimization approach. Feedback from participants was obtained through a satisfaction survey and a project assessment; it reported enthusiastic project acceptance and good teamwork climate. Among the results of the research performed in the four hospitals, several measures have been effectively implemented to reduce the lead-time for patients from registration to discharge. At the same time, patient-staffratio and quality of care have been either maintained or even improved. However, lack of a definite conclusive evaluation can be explained by the research project still being implemented. The value of this paper lies in demonstrating how Lean contributes to achieve better process performance and high staffsatisfaction, when implemented within the whole supply chain of a healthcare delivery system on a regular basis. © 2018.","Emergency department; Healthcare; Healthcare delivery process; Lean; Patient flow improvement",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

As one of the macroscopic traffic flow variables, density can be derived by several approaches. At first, the density of traffic was measured over space, which difficult to be collected mainly in the long section of the road. Therefore, the density variable was simply derived from the fundamental relation of macroscopic traffic flow variable. By this method, the individual speed and flow variable are required in the local measurement. Both traffic density and flow will apply the concept of PCU, which refers to the Indonesian Highway Capacity Manual, 1997 to consider the different characteristic of the vehicle. In the mixed traffic of developing countries, providing traffic data was difficult due to the limitation of the traffic sensor infrastructures. Frequently, providing density variable relies on the sample data for speed analysis. In the present study, the estimation of density will focus on the local measurement over a time interval. By using individual data, density is proposed to be measured directly over time, in which the equation can be modified to utilize the sample data. The number of sample for speed analysis will be varied to know the accuracy and the performance of each approach in the density estimation of mixed traffic. Several approaches for density estimation will be summarized and compared each other. Theoretically, the estimated density which measured over time and space by using individual data can provide the most appropriate result. So, this estimated density will be established as an actual density throughout the study. Then, the performance of each approach either using individual or sample data will be evaluated upon the actual traffic density by mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The result shows by using the same trap length to measure the speed, the existing and the proposed approaches provide a good estimation of density either by utilizing individual data or sample data of the vehicle speed. This result was indicated by the MAPE value, which obtained under ten percent. Based on the further evaluation of the MAPE value, the performance of each approach was changed by utilizing the different category of data.

The process of erosion and accretion that occurred on Brebes coastal area induces certain impacts. The purpose of this study was to determine the pattern of hydro-oceanography and seabed morphology in coastal areas. Primary data obtained during field survey was employed in this study, which was processed using simulation models by applying spatial discretization method that is based on the finite volume equations to obtain the condition of waves, currents, sediment transports and tides. The results showed Brebes waters included in the category of shallow waters with slope topography, while the tidal type is a mixed tide prevailing semidiurnal. Waves were generated in the Northern Brebes then were moved towards the mainland until it deformed, leaving energy in the form of longshore current that goes into the area around the beach ridge. The time difference between high and low tide was influenced by the mass of estuary water supply from the sea as well as the mass of water from upstream to downstream. The high level of vulnerability in the coastal area requires the more effective and efficient treatment to prevent a negative impact on physical and social conditions. © Advanced Science Engineering Information Technology. 2018.","Current; Hydrodynamics; Sediment transport; Wave",,"Ondara, K.; Research Institute for Coastal Resources and Vulnerability, Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries Jl, Raya Padang-Painan km.16, Bungus, Indonesia; email: koko_ondara@alumni.itb.ac.id",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The centralized system of SDN, which separates control plane and data plan, has an immense number of advantages, but it also has the risk of becoming a single point of network failure. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is the major issues faced in the security aspect of SDN. This attack can make network resources unreachable by the real packets. The widely known method has been implemented on SDN for avoiding a DDoS attack is Three-Sigma method. Three-Sigma method uses a threshold value to determine the existence of a DDoS attack. However, this method has drawbacks regarding accuracy in determining the DDoS attack. The main contribution of this paper is utilizing central control plane of SDN for improving accuracy on detecting the DDoS attack. Several experiments performed for proving the concept. The result shows the new method can improve the accuracy of detection of a DDoS attack, either in constant or fluctuating traffic, by reducing the false positive.

This work has been extended by estimating several vegetation parameters like Normalized Difference of Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MASVI), and Soil & Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (SARVI). Once the estimation of these parameters was done, the effect of noise was verified. Wavelet decomposes the image into frequency subbands and de-noises each subband separately. These subbands help to increase the resolution. The general problem of the homomorphic filter is that it doesn't enhance the Low-frequency components which also play a key role in estimating Vegetation Indices (VI).So it was modified to enhance the high-frequency components as well as low-frequency details. Monitoring of vegetation parameters using remote sensing is one of the prominent ways in the estimation of crop yield, Land Use Land Cover (LULC), Water resource management, Drought management, etc. The high-resolution image is more preferable than moderate resolution image to retrieve VI.

Cleanliness of eating tables, food temperature, smoke-free environment and food handler appearance are the key food safety considerations for the respondents. The results showed that a high percentage of male respondents (57.98%) experienced food poisoning, and considered food from restaurants is the cause of foodborne diseases. Respondents have utmost awareness about the cleanliness of utensils and kitchen surfaces, hand hygiene, and preclusion of cross-contamination, however, described a poor knowledge concerning the temperature and heat treatment of the food. Good understanding regarding food poisoning symptoms was observed among the respondents, especially in a female group. The outcome revealed that foreign students, irrespective of gender, demonstrated comparable food safety and food handling knowledge.

A series of connection tests were made to investigate the capacity of connections by its deformation and load caring capacity. Furthermore, Screw connections were compared to adhesive connections. Those were created of 1 screw to 3 installed screw using 8 mm screw. On the other hand, 50%, 75% and 100% percentage of adhesive, i.e., A3M and ASK were also added to be evaluated. As a result, the experimental condition was carried out for developing a model to predict the performance capacity of each specimen. The test specimens are a single lap C connection with one end fixed by a grip, and the other end is tensioned. Each specimen was subjected to the load maximum capacity and the load deformation behaviour. The adhesive material was made of the total area of screw connection which is controlled by the volume of its area. Further, the comparison connection was considered for the analysis of the connection capacity, which was estimated from the specimen's maximum load and the load-deformation behaviour. This research is also considered to face the problem of significant fracture mechanism and used as a further alternative solution. As a result, both adhesive materials could easily displace screw connection. ASK has a lower strength capacity than A3M but implied a better fracture mechanism. It was offered nearly similar behaviour and was suggested to evaluate the behaviour of screw-adhesive connection in advance. © IJASEIT.","Adhesive; Behaviour; Cold-formed steel; Connection; Experimental; Strength capacity",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

A study aimed to explore low-cost media compositions enriched with organic matters for in vitro multiplication and development of protocorm-like bodies (PLBs) of E. graminea. This study consisted of two stages. The first stage was to determine the best basic media for in vitro PLBs multiplication by testing NPK 20-20-20, Murashige and Skoog (MS), Knudson C (KC), and Vacin and Went (VW). The second stage was to compare the development of PLBs of E. graminea using NPK 20-20-20 as the basic media, supplemented with three types of organic matters (Cavendish banana, potato and coconut water) and four organic matter concentrations (50,100, 150, 200 ml L-1), arranged under Factorial Completely Randomized Design with ten replications. The results showed that orchid PLB of E. graminea could be planted on NPK medium with similar success in growth and development, in term of PLB number, PLB diameter, leaf number in plantlet, plantlet height, root number and root length, to those planted on MS medium. Among complex organic growth supplements, including coconut water, potato, and banana, coconut water at a concentration of 57.17-98.67 ml L-1 resulted in the best multiplication of PLB, in term of the greatest number, PLB diameter, and fresh weight. Coconut water promotes the greatest conversion of PLB into plantlets of E. graminea at an optimum concentration of 91.63-102.89 ml L-1.

One of the most important bio-signals used for health analysis is the electrocardiographic (ECG) signal. It provides information about the heart rate, rhythm, and morphology of heart. Many algorithms are proposed over years for automated ECG analysis. Due to their computational complexity, not all these techniques can be implemented on wearable devices for real-time ECG detection. In this frame, a particular interest is toward the algorithms for automatic QRS detection. Different algorithms have been presented in the literature. Among all, more suitable class for the implementation on embedded systems is based on the use of signal derivatives and thresholds. These algorithms are composed by pre-processing stage, for the noise removal, and decision stage for the QRS detection. In literature, the different algorithms were discriminated only with respect to their preprocessing stages. Furthermore, not all algorithms were tested with standard database: this makes the results difficult to compare and evaluate. Moreover, the algorithms performance in case of pathological behaviours was not compared. This paper is motivated by the need to perform a comparison of the whole algorithms, both pre-processing and decision stages, under a standard database (MITBIH ECG database of Physionet), either for non-pathological and pathological signals. The results confirm that the Pan & Tompkins algorithm has the best performance in terms of QRS complex detection. However, in some cases, its performance is comparable with the other algorithms ones. For this reason, in the applications in which the reduced of computational complexity is an important constraint, it is possible to implemented algorithms with comparable performance but with lesser complexity with respect to P & T algorithm. © IJASEIT.","ECG processing; Low power; QRS detection; Real-time analysis; Wearable computing",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

This type of damper can effectively decrease the structure response when the TLCD parameters such as the natural frequency and damping factor are well selected. Even though several TLCD models have been proposed and many algorithms to optimize the TLCD parameters have been developed. However, it is very little research has been conducted to evaluate the TLCD damping factor experimentally. A simple empirical method for adjusting the TLCD damping factor is by varying the orifice-blocking ratio. In this research, 5 types of blocking ratio were trialled in the TLCD. They were without orifice and with 2, 4, 6 and 8 18 mm diameter orifices. The TLCD is positioned on the second floor of a Two-DOF shear structure. A frequency response function showing the ratio between the response magnitude and the excitation force on the structure in the frequency domain was recorded for each trial. The results show that the TLCDs with orifices damped vibrations more effectively than the one without orifice. The larger the blocking ratio, the larger the TLCD damping factor. Two 18 mm orifices were insufficient to damp the vibration as the blocking ratio is too large and TLCD is less responsive to the vibrations. The optimum condition of a U-Shaped TLCD blocking ratio was found to be 70.77% which corresponded to 4 holes of 18 mm orifice diameter. This type of TLCD dampened up to 80.04% of the vibration magnitude. © IJASEIT.","Blocking ratio; Damping factor; Orifice; TLCD",,"Son, L.; Mechanical Engineering Department, Andalas University, Kampus Limau ManisIndonesia; email: lovelyson@ft.unand.ac.id",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

It was shown that the strain readings from the spiral reinforcement indicate a subtle contribution regarding the confinement mechanism of the hollow section of a pile. In addition, it was evident that spiral reinforcement seems to be compressed when the concrete section resists compression strain due to flexural load.

In Indonesia, most of the high-rise buildings constructed are made of reinforced concrete structures. In principles, the use of high-strength concrete, coupled with high strength rebars for high rise r/c buildings will result in more efficient and more constructible r/c constructions. However, in Indonesia, the use of high strength rebars for seismicresistant r/c buildings is still prohibited. SNI 2847:2013 Section 21 specifies that the yield strength for reinforcing bars used in structural elements of special moment resisting frames is limited to 420 MPa. This provision is meant to limit higher shear and higher bond demand in the structural elements assigned to dissipate seismic energy. This paper presents a study on the use of high strength rebars in seismic resistant r/c buildings. In the study, 20 story buildings located in a region with high seismicity are designed. Two types of rebars are used, i.e., those with the yield strength of 550 MPa and of 690 MPa. The building structures are designed as the special moment resisting frame. The seismic performances of the buildings are then investigated by performing non-linear time history analysis. Seven pairs of scaled ground motions are used for the analysis. From this analysis, the failure mechanism of r/c buildings reinforced with 550 MPa yield strength is governed by beam mechanism, while the buildings reinforced with 690MPa yield strength rebars shows failure mechanism dominated by story mechanism. Globally, the performance levels of the buildings are within the zone of Damage Control (i.e., between immediate occupancy and life safety). Based on the findings, some recommendations are proposed for the use of high strength rebars in the design of seismic resistant high rise r/c buildings. © IJASEIT.","Ductility; High strength rebars; Non-linear time history analysis; Performance-based design",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

It can be found in many daily applications, such as in the telecommunication system, radio microwave system, emergency lighting, the backup system of power plants, even in a photovoltaic system. It is often used as the backup source in case of a failure in the main supply system. The duration of how long the battery can still supply energy to loads without being charged is defined as the battery autonomy day. If during its daily utilization the battery often exceeds its autonomy day, it can result in the deterioration of the battery lifetime. It produces the deviation of the battery lifetime specification which has been previously determined by the manufacturer. This paper presents the results of battery lifetime prediction at a base-transceiver station (BTS) of Telkomsel Company in Indonesia. It has two main purposes which are to evaluate the policy of autonomy day and to predict the remaining lifetime of the battery before reaching its time limit. The obtained results show that there have been some alterations from the batteries' former policy of autonomy day, from 72 hours to 43.03 hours and 43.26 hours for both existing batteries respectively with considered depth-of-discharge (DOD) of 20%. By using a linear data curve fitting, the results of calculation and analysis indicate that the remaining useful lifetime of both batteries were 5.72 years and 5.77 years. Another approach using an exponential data curve fitting resulted in the remaining lifetime of 7.12 years and 7.16 years for both batteries respectively.","Autonomy day; Battery lifetime; Lead-acid battery",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The existing rows have created opportunities for an autonomous vehicle to navigate in between the trees to perform the plantation activities such as scouting, monitoring, rowing, pesticide spraying and others. A new approach to detect the landmarks and navigate in the farm based on the lightweight sensors and less computation effort is proposed. In this method, the tree detection and diameter estimation techniques implement the modified tree-triangle diameter technique by using an innovative technique based on infrared sensors. Then, in substituting the GPS signal problems during the navigation and localization problems, a curve-based navigation approach is formulated. The path is planned based on the third polynomial Bezier curve by projecting series of waypoints to create a solid path from one point to another. Then, the trajectory plan is derived for the autonomous vehicle to follow these waypoints during the navigation. At the same time, the mapping technique implements the memory utilization method in order to ease the localization process as well as landmarks mapping in the visual map which is oriented in two-dimensional coordinate format. All of these functions are created, formulated and tested thoroughly in the embedded microcontroller development board platform by using dsPIC30F6014A chip on the omnidirectional vehicle platform.","Inter-row tracking; Mapping technique; Navigation scheme; SLAM; Tree diameter measurement",,"Thamrin, N.M.; Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARAMalaysia; email: norashikin.mthamrin@gmail.com",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

In Nigeria, high anthropogenic activities rapidly increase above the standard of the threshold values especially the lighting sources. This increase due to the vastly growing of industries, residential and commercial uses and other sources such as street lighting in urban and semiurban areas, which can make the night sky brightness in the area above the threshold set for polluted status. The study measures the night sky brightness at the most densely populated urban centers of Nigeria; to estimate and quantify the level of the night sky brightness from the sites nearby the cities of the planned research study. The research monitored the zenith sky brightness from November 2015 to March 2016 using Sky Quality Meter (SQM).

XDE is a crossover-first variant of the original DE algorithm where XjDE is the crossover-first variant of the self-adaptive jDE algorithm. The original DE representing a fixed parameter strategy is tested against four self-adaptive algorithms, namely the DESACR, DESACRF, SDE and jDE algorithms. Although XDE is able to outperform XjDE in all 15 test problems for the lowest dimensional benchmark test setting of 10 variables, the crossover-first approach in XjDE is able to improve its performance and obtained better results over XDE in some of the test problems for the higher-dimensional benchmark test settings of 30, 50 and 100 variables. As such, this shows that there is some merit in adopting the crossover-first approach into the self-adaptive XjDE algorithm since the CR and F parameters are automatically adjusted and optimized by the algorithm itself as compared to the fixed CR and F in XDE which has to be manually tuned by hand. The results also show that different self-adaptive parameter tuning schemes have significantly different effects on the performance of DE as the number of optimization dimensions increases.","Crossover-first differential evolution; Evolutionary optimization; Genetic operations; Non-linear optimization",,"Teo, J.; Faculty of Computing and Informatics, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Jalan UMS, Malaysia; email: jtwteo@ums.edu.my",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The study employed the descriptive method. A structured questionnaire with open-ended questions served as the main tool for data gathering. Respondents were selected purposively from the Department of Agriculture's master list of farmers. They were selected based on the following criteria: owner of at least one hectare; had been practicing farming for at least five years; a resident of the municipality and living within 50 km radius of synoptic stations. Frequency counts, weighted means and percentages were used to describe the profile of respondents and their climate change adaptation measures. The major climate hazards the respondents had to contend with are flood, drought, typhoon, erosion and volcanic eruption. Typhoons happen almost every year with varying magnitude. In terms of flood and landslide, residents living in low-lying villages and near river channels, shorelines and mountain slopes are most affected. For the climate-induced drought, the provinces of Albay, Camarines Sur and Catanduanes are more at risk. Volcanic eruptions on the other hand happen in the provinces of Albay and Sorsogon, and hazards brought about by these are volcanic quakes, pyroclastic flow, mudflow, ash fall, landslides, and bush fire. With these climate hazards, farmers practice various CCA measures. Availing of climate forecast services was the most commonly cited and ranked highest across the 4 major hazards, except for erosion where livelihood/income diversification ranked highest as CCA measure. Farmers in the province of Catanduanes had the highest mean score on CCA followed by those in the provinces of Camarines, Sorsogon and Albay. Recommendations include: provision of adequate investment to enhance farmers' access to climate advisories; strengthen nonstructural interventions such as policies, knowledge development, and awareness, to make CCA more effective and reduce the impact of climate change; encourage partnerships between informal processes and formal interventions to facilitate adoption of CCA initiatives introduced by the government; and provide necessary support for the utilization of indigenous knowledge on CCA measures to increase the resiliency of farmers against climate hazards.","Climate change adaptation; Climate hazards; Natural disaster; Risk",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

In many anaerobic digestions of sewage sludge, the inoculum to substrate ratio and mixing were variable to take into consideration for efficient performance. However, the organic content in sewage sludge varied due to the composition of the raw wastewater being treated and the treatment condition. This study is focused on the methane production from the digestion of domestic mixed sewage sludge in the batch reactor at different organic contents. Biochemical methane potential (BMP) was conducted at the inoculum to substrate ratio (I/S) ratio of 2:0, each with different organic content. On the termination day of the BMP assay, the sample from each BMP reactor was tested for pH, and alkalinity to determine the status of the anaerobic process. Results showed that the anaerobic process was stable since the pH remained in the pH range which is suitable for the anaerobic process to take place. The anaerobic process was also confirmed stabled as indicated by low value (&lt; 0.3) of intermediate alkalinity to partial alkalinity ratio (IA/PA).

For the organic content of 0.68, the maximum methane production rate constant was 13.97 mL CH4/g VS /hr. For the case of lower organic content, the maximum methane production rate constant was 6.41 mL CH4/g VS /hr.

Nevertheless, radar cross sections (RCS) fluctuations remains a known problem in radars. Target localization using narrowband signal produces reduced accuracy due to RCS fluctuations. One of the solutions to this problem is the utilization of frequency diversity of wideband signal. This paper presents target localization in MIMO radars using an adaptive orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform for effective frequency diversity utilization. Each transmitting antenna transmits an OFDM signal in different time slots and received by the each receiving antenna in the receiver array. A joint direction-of-departure (DOD) and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation scheme is applied to each of the OFDM sub-carrier using two-way multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm. The estimation results at each sub-carrier are combined based on majority decision using angle histogram (nonparametric approach) to formulate the final wideband angle estimation. In addition, an adaptive power allocation among the subcarriers is implemented, where the system evaluates the signal quality at each sub-carrier and consequently formulates a feedback to the MIMO transmitting side. The following transmission will comprise of OFDM waveform that focuses the transmit power at selected sub-carriers only. The sub-carrier selection is based on singular values obtained from singular value decomposition operation at each of the sub-carrier. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through numerical simulations as well as validation by experiments in a radio anechoic chamber. It was demonstrated that the usage of a larger number of sub-carriers improves the angle estimation accuracy.","DOA; DOD; MIMO radars; MUSIC; OFDM; Power allocation; Radar cross section; Sub-carrier selection",,"Kobayashi, T.; Wireless Systems Laboratory, Tokyo Denki University, 5 Senju-Asahi-Cho, Japan; email: mfarid044@salam.uitm.edu.my",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

However, BP is inherently slow in learning and it sometimes gets trapped at local minima. These problems occur mailnly due to a constant and non-optimum learning rate (a fixed step size) in which the fixed value of learning rate is set to an initial starting value before training patterns for an input layer and an output layer. This fixed learning rate often leads the BP network towrds failure during steepest descent. Therefore to overcome the limitations of BP, this paper introduces an improvement to back propagation gradient descent with adapative learning rate (BPGD-AL) by changing the values of learning rate locally during the learning process.

Developing an indoor location tracking system based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of WSN is considered cost effective and the simplest method. The suitable technique for estimating position out of RSSI measurements is the extended Kalman filter (EKF) which is especially used for nonlinear data as RSSI. In order to reduce the estimated errors from EKF algorithm, this work adopted forward data processing of the EKF algorithm to improve the accuracy of the filtering output, its called iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF). However, using IEKF algorithm should know the stopping criterion value that is influenced to the maximum number iterations of this system. The number of iterations performed will be affected to the computation time although it can improve the estimation position. In this paper, we propose modified IEKF for mobile cooperative tracking system within only 4 iterations number. The illustrated results using RSSI measurements and simulation in MATLAB show that our proposed method has the capability to reduce error estimation percentage up to 19.3%, with MSE (mean square error) 0.88 m compared with a conventional IEKF algorithm with MSE 1.09 m.

Nowadays, more consumers consciously desire not only fresh and nutritious but also safe fruits with low or free of microorganisms and chemical contamination. Non-thermal plasma (NTP) is one of the emerging technologies that could potentially decontaminate the fresh food and food processing surfaces. Recently, NTP emerges as a new sanitizing method in the agro-industrial application, where the qualitative characteristics of the treated product could probably be modified by the reactive species as well as the residues of oxidation processes. This study evaluates the changes of physicochemical indexes of Nam Dok Mai mango treated with several NTP conditions. The NTP process was discharged in 0.05 % sodium bicarbonate solution under different voltage levels (800-1500 V) and various treatment durations (2-10 min). It was found that there were significant decreases (p≤0.05) in titratable acidity and total phenolic content of NTP treated mango, while the total soluble solid showed a significant increase (p≤0.05). The color and texture parameters of this fruit with NTP treatments were not significantly different (p≥0.05).

There is a tendency that the younger the plants are infected, the greater the damage caused by the Begomovirus infection will be. This study aimed to reveal the exact time of Begomovirus infection for the purpose of resistance plant selection and to determine the onset of Begomovirus infection which resulted in the most devastating damage to the plant. The study was conducted in a factorial randomized completely block design with two factors. The first factor was 5 chili pepper genotypes and the second factor was the infection at three phases of the plant with no infection as a control treatment. The results showed that the screening for resistant and susceptible Begomovirus infection on pepper genotypes was very effective when it was done during cotyledon phase/two leaf using individual transmission method. Genotype UNIBC GTS1 was the most susceptible to infection of Begomovirus because it had the highest disease intensity, the fastest incubation period, small plant dry weight and fruit weight per plant. In contrast, genotype IPBC 12 was the most resistant genotypes. It had lower disease intensity and long incubation period. However, despite this resistant characteristic, the weight of fruit per plant of IPBC 12 genotype was not significantly different from the susceptible genotype. Genotype IPBC 14, despite having high disease intensity, could produce the highest fruit weight per plant compared to other genotypes. The infection of Begomovirus on susceptible genotype UNIB, C GTS1 at various phases of the plant growth, led to the pepper fruit become shorter, lower plant dry weight, smaller numbers of fruits and fruit weight per plant. While the resistant genotypes IPBC 12 had low dry weight when infected by Begomovirus in the phase of cotyledon.","Begomovirus; Chili pepper; Resistance; Susceptible",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

This cause disposal problem and air pollution problem from burning activity. In line with the Malaysian Government Policy on the application of green technology concept through the 5R's practice, this agricultural waste has a potential to be commercialized as material for landfill liner. A factor that governs the workability of landfill liner materials is the permeability should be less than 1x10-9 m/s. Therefore, a low permeability material needs to be installed to minimise the environmental impact on the leachate intrusion into groundwater. A series of standard tests to find environmental and geotechnical properties such as atterberg limit test (liquid limit, plastic limit, compaction test), permeability test (falling head method), leachate characteristics and heavy metal test were conducted at various ratio of hybrid materials (KC:RH and KC: CF in the ratio of 1:1 and 1:2 respectively). Experimental results confirmed that the hydraulic conductivity of the mixture of KC:RH:KF in the ratio of 1:1:1 is 7.29 x 10-11 m/s was less than 10-9 m/s, satisfying the requirement for landfill liner materials. Heavy metal testing showed that this hybrid material (RH:KF and RH:CF for ratio 1:2) were able to reduce at least 50 % of the leachate contaminants. The proposed hybrid materials (RH:KF and RH:CF) is a green material for the landfill (as it can improve heavy metal adsorption), increase the workability of the landfill by improving the conductivity of the conventional liners), minimizing manpower on site (no need expertise for installation) and reduction in cost (in terms of the use of waste materials).","Coconut fiber; Hydraulic conductivity; Kapok fiber; Landfill liner; Rice husk",,"Razali, W.N.; Department of Language Studies, Universiti Teknologi MARAMalaysia",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

In the Indonesian language, stemming is of crucial importance: words have prefixes, suffixes, infixes, and confixes that make them match to relate difficult words. This research proposed a stemmer with more accurate word results by employing an algorithm which gave more than one word candidate results and more than one affix combinations. New stemming algorithm is called CAT stemming algorithm. Here, the word results did not depend on the order of the morphological rule. All rules were checked, and the word results were kept in a candidate list. To make an efficient stemmer, two kinds of word lists (vocabularies) were used: words that had more than one candidate words and list of root word as a candidate reference.

This study presents a new modeling of an IPA system using Hammerstein model based Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithm. The Hammerstein model is one of the blocks structured nonlinear models often used to model a nonlinear system and it consists of a static nonlinear block followed by a linear block of dynamic element. In this study, the static nonlinear block was represented by a deadzone of the pneumatic valve, while the linear block was represented by a dynamic element of IPA system. A RLS has been employed as the main algorithm in order to estimate the parameters of the Hammerstein model. The validity of the proposed model has been verified by conducting a real-time experiment. All of the criteria as outlined in the system identification's procedures were successfully complied by the proposed Hammerstein model as it managed to provide a stable system, higher best fit, lower loss function and lower final prediction error than a linear model developed before.

Multiple subductions of North Sulawesi in the northern arm of Sulawesi and east Sangihe subduction in the east has triggered an active magmatism and volcanism. Formation and occurrences deposits of precious- and base metals have been found in the North Sulawesi Volcanic Arc. This paper describes a recent study on hydrothermal alteration mineralogy associated with one of the prospects in the region, namely Buladu gold prospect that for years has been operated by local artisanal miners. The study is focused on hand specimen and microscopic observation as well as XRD analysis. Lithologically, the study area is arranged by sandstone are members of Dolokapa volcano-sedimentary formation, above unconformity andesitic-basaltic volcanic breccia are members of the Pliocene Wobudu Formation and is intruded by granodiorite rocks. The petrographic study reveals that host rock of the mineralization is flow-volcanic breccia which shows porphyritic and flows structures. Resulting assemblages of secondary minerals are mineral associations characteristic of the magmatic-hydrothermal system the following imperative alteration zones could be recognized an outer zone of chloritic alteration and the inner zone of argillic alteration. The alteration showed characteristics of pervasive to selective alteration, where clay and quartz totally replaced groundmass, whereas chlorite and clay minerals were selectively altered plagioclase phenocrysts. Clay mineral species identified by XRD include chlorite and illite. These mineralogical features indicate that the hydrothermal alteration is an argillic type, which is spatially distal to the mineralization. Mafic mineral in andesite lava partly altered into mineral assemblage chlorite-epidote-quartzcarbonate show propylitic type, which is the outermost zone of mineralization.","Alteration; Buladu; Gold; Hydrothermal; Mineralogy",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Kintamani orange plantations cultivated three types of oranges: Tangerine, selayar, and mandarin oranges. The famous orange in Bali today is Kintamani orange, tangerine type. The typical flavour and aroma of Kintamani tangerine make it is favoured by consumers from various regions. Based on the information from Bangli District Agriculture Office and the results of field surveys in the last two years (in 2013 and 2014), cultivation of orange in Kintamani has been infected with anthracnose disease. The disease is characterized by symptoms whereby brown twigs spread to the leaves and fruit, and the fruits which are about to be harvested rot simultaneously and eventually fall due to decay. This condition causes farmers to suffer significant losses. The cause of anthracnose on Kintamani orange is Colletotrichum gloeosporioides . The Control of these diseases has been carried out by farmers with various synthetic fungicides but the disease is still widespread. It is feared that the uncontrolled use of synthetic pesticides can harm the environment, cause resistance to C. gloeosporioides fungi, and kill non-target beneficial micro-organism. It is necessary to conduct research that aims to control anthracnose biologically to maintain the ecological balance and environmental safety. Based on the results of this research by exploring the fungi on healthy plants around orange trees infected with anthracnose diseases, nine isolates of antagonist candidate fungus were obtained based on colony colour of fungal hyphae (IS1, IS2, IS3, IS4, IS5. IS6, IS7, IS8, IS9). Based on the test results of the in vitro dual culture, two candidates of antagonistic fungal isolates were selected, the isolates IS4 and IS7. It was because on day 7 after the second dual culture, these two isolates had the highest percentage of inhibition, 89.22% and 85.11 % respectively. Based on the conventional and molecular identifications, it is known that the two candidate isolates of antagonistic fungus (IS4 and IS7) belong to one species of the Aspergillus aculeatus.","Antagonists fungi; Anthracnose; Aspergillus aculeatus; Cilletotricum gloeosporioides; Kintamani tangerine; Orange",,"Sudana, I.M.; Postgraduate Agricultural Science Program, Udayana UniversityIndonesia",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The potential applications of corn silk are closely related to its chemical composition and the action mechanisms of its bioactive compounds, which have beneficial effects on human health, such as flavonoids and phenolics. This study aimed to investigate the chemical and phytochemical characteristics of local corn silk powder of three different varieties, i.e. Bisma, Arjuna, and Srikandi Putih. Phytochemical and proximate analyses were conducted on each sample of corn silk powder. The total phenolic content was examined using the Folin- Ciocalteau method, while the beta sitosterol was analysed by gas chromatography and the antioxidant activity of the extract was evaluated using the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) method. The results show that all samples had different amounts for their moisture, ash, protein, fat and carbohydrate contents from the proximate analyses. The Bisma variety of corn silk powder reveals the highest fat and protein contents, which are 0.30%±0.02 and 17.70 ±0.47, respectively. Furthermore, the highest total phenolics, total flavonoids, beta-sitosterol contents and antioxidant activity for the corn silk powder are also demonstrated by Bisma; i.e. 8262.93±178.59 μg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g for total phenolics, 236.03±8.37 μg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g for total flavonoids, 1343.93±78.44ppm for beta-sitosterol and 73%±1.09 for antioxidant activity.

The aim of this study was to develop a model between the GI and bitumen content of the Marshall properties that includes density, voids in the mix (VIM), voids in mineral aggregate (VMA), voids filled with asphalt (VFA), stability, and flow. The materials used were unmodified Asphalt Cement 60/70 with bitumen content variation of 4.5% to 8.0% of the mix and five variations of the aggregate gradation.

Multiple Polynomial Regression (MPR) models were specified to find the relationship between the GI and bitumen content of the Marshall properties. The visualization of the relationship between the GI, bitumen content and Marshall properties used contour charts. The results showed that the MPR determines the model of the relationship between the GI and bitumen content of the density, VIM, VMA, VFA, stability, and flow that have a very strong relationship (R2 &gt; 0.9).

It means that the system has some control inputs is lower than its DOF (Degrees of Freedom). This condition causes quadrotor to have limited mobility because of its inherent under actuation, namely, the availability of four independent control signals (four-speed rotating propellers) versus 6 degrees of freedom parameterizing quadrotor position or orientation in space. If a quadrotor is made to have 6 DOF, a full motion control system to optimize the flight will be different from before. So it becomes necessary to develop over actuated quad tiltrotor. Quad tiltrotor has control signals more than its DOF. Therefore, we can refer it to the overactuated system. We need a good control system to fly the quad tiltrotor. Good control systems can be designed using the model of the quad tiltrotor system. We can create quad tiltrotor model using its dynamics based on Newton-Euler approach. After we have a set of model, we can simulate the control system using some control method. There are several control methods that we can use in the quad tiltrotor flight system. However, we can improve the control by implementing a modern control system that uses the concept of state space. The simulations show that the quad tiltrotor has done successful translational motion without significant interference. Also, undesirable rotation movement in the quad tiltrotor flight when performing the translational motions resulting from the transition process associated with the tilt rotor change was successfully reduced below 1 degree.","Control; Overactuated; State space; UAV",,"Dharmawan, A.; Department of Computer Science and Electronics, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, Universitas Gadjah MadaIndonesia; email: andi_dharmawan@ugm.ac.id",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The growing popularity of tagging systems is leading to an increasing need for automatic generation of recommended items for users. Much previous research focuses on incorporating recommender techniques in social tagging systems to support the suggestion of suitable tags for annotating related items. Collaborative filtering is one such technique. The most critical task in collaborative filtering is finding related users with similar preferences, i.e., ""liked-minded"" users. Despite the popularity of collaborative filtering, it still suffers from certain limitations in relation to ""cold-start"" users, for example, where often there are insufficient preferences to make recommendations. Moreover, there is the data-sparsity problem, where there is limited user feedback data to identify similarities in users' interests because there is no intersection between users' transactional data a situation which also results in degraded recommendation quality. For this reason, in this paper, we present a new collaborative filtering approach based on users' semantic tags, which calculates the similarity between users by discovering the semantic spaces in their posted tags. We believe that this approach better reflects the semantic similarity between users according to their tagging perspectives and consequently improves recommendations through the identification of semantically related items for each user. Our experiment on a real-life dataset shows that the proposed approach outperforms the traditional user-based collaborative filtering approach in terms of improving the quality of recommendations.","Collaborative filtering; Recommendation system; Social tagging system",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The expression analysis showed that the best expression was achieved by protease deficient strain SMD1168. Molecular weight characterization informed that the fusion protein was 85 kDa in size as its theoritical size. Western blotting methods confirmed the identity of fusion protein based on the recognition by anti HSA and anti hIFNα-2 antibodies. This result strongly indicated that the fusion protein was successfully produced in Pichia pastoris. Protein quantification informed that the protein yield was 14 mg/L (OD600=2).

The higher of ignition values, density, and viscosity of VCOs compared to other oils, such as kerosene was a basic consideration to modify the vegetable oil pressure stove (VOPS). The VOPS design employed with spiral coil pipeline as oil preheater that was intended to reduce viscosity and ignition values of VCOs. The spiral coil pipeline in this VOPS will auto preheat the oil to decrease its viscosity and to produce smaller droplets before being combusted. The performance indicators fuel/stove/vessel combination were conducted by measurements, calculations, and experiments. The performance parameters were represented by fuel characteristic, oil droplet diameter, combustion flame and fuel consumption. The main purpose of this experiment was to study the use of VCOs as alternative fuels as well as combustion performance and economic evaluation. The experiment was conducted by using three kinds of VCOs as fuel; used vegetable oil (UCO), crude VCO and fresh UCO on VOPS. The VCOs could be burned in a red-bluish flame with a maximum flame temperature of flue gases of 1100 °C, 1042 °C, and 920 °C, respectively. Atomization of all VCOs could produce fuel droplets diameter of 155 μm-650 μm and lower viscosity and lower ignition values of the fuels.

The new secondary-weight values, generated due to the addition of midpoints, were also represented as a linear combination of the corresponding primary/axial weight values. An improved neural networks in learning from examples have also been proposed where both of the proposed algorithms able to constrain the shape of the surface in two-dimensional and multidimensional cases and produced more realistic and acceptable results as compared to the previous version. The ability of the proposed approach to models the exponential increase/decrease in the belief values by using high-ordered polynomials without introducing 'over-fitting' effects was investigated. The performance of the proposed method in modelling the exponential increase/decrease in belief values was carried out on real cases taken from real casting data. The computed graphical results of the proposed methods were compared with the current Knowledge Hyper-surface and neural-network methods.

The above-stipulated requirement can be easily met for substations/exposed areas with online PQ measurements, which capture voltage magnitude and duration that could be corroborated with tripping events. However, it is not practical to have online monitoring facilities as the majority of medium voltage (MV) substations are not equipped with voltage and current transformers where measurements could be tapped. Current procedures of characterizing voltage sag for substations without measurements facilities is time-consuming. In this paper, a fast procedure using combinations of fault simulations and regression analysis to characterize voltage sag is proposed. Extensive results from 160 simulation cases comprising 4 network operating configurations, 20 fault distances, and 2 fault types are used in the regression formulation. The results based on the proposed fast procedure for MV distribution network without online monitoring is found to be fairly accurate.","Fault analysis; Regression analysis; Voltage sag (dip) characteristic; Voltage sag propagation",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Low efficiency in a battery is responsible for the low-mileage of electric vehicles. Improving battery efficiency can be done by harvesting the energy wasted during braking, which is commonly called as regenerative braking. The braking energy is to be used to recharge the battery. However, this braking method is not implementable in some conditions, including the conditions when the battery is full, when the vehicle speed is very slow, and when the desired braking currents exceed the converter capability. Therefore, mechanical braking is also still required. This paper proposes a simple but effective technique to deal with the problems found so far in the regenerative braking implementation. The fuzzy-logic theory is implemented to control the sharing proportion between the use of regenerative and electric brakings using one single brake-lever. To improve the current response of electric braking, the proportional-integral control method is used. Being compared to the widely used braking techniques, the method proposed and explored through simulation in this paper offers double advantages, which is increasing the battery efficiency as well as the driving comfort and practicality. The implementation of the method can extend the battery life because the energy regeneration is adapted to the state-of-charge and charging capability of the battery so that the battery can be maintained not to be overcharged.","Brushless direct current motor; Plug-in electric vehicle; Regenerative braking system; Six-step method; Voltage-source inverter",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

This disaster has resulted in adverse coastline changes in West Sumatra Province. The mainland area has been lost for hundreds meters due to abrasion. A field study has been conducted and found that beach without vegetations is very vulnerable to abrasion than the beach with vegetations. In some place, abrasion protection has been done by using hard structures but this way is not natural and attractive. A field investigation also found that several types of endemic beach vegetation in West Sumatra can live for decades till now. This condition shows that beach vegetations can be used for beach protection purposes against abrasion. This study describes the mechanism of vegetation root in protecting beaches against abrasion using numerical simulation. The data for simulation are obtained from laboratory tests of beach sands, In the numerical simulation, the beach sand is considered as geo-material that follows Mohr- Coulomb's constitutive law while the roots are modelled as geo-synthetic elements that can only resist the tension forces. There are three conditions to be considered in the numerical models. The first model: beach without any roots, the second one: roots under the ground surface and The third model: roots reach the ground surface. Those three models are analyzed separately using the same dimensions and parameters. The simulation results show that vegetation roots give the unity effect to the surrounding sand into a large mass. This unified soil mass that come down into the bottom provides mechanical resistance against the pull force.

Multifingered hand contacts the object at some arbitrary locations during the object manipulation and applies the gripping force to hold and manipulate the object without slip. It is desirable to use the optimum gripping force during the grasp manipulation for two reasons; firstly, to prevent the object from damages, secondly, to decrease the cost of the manipulation. With these objectives in mind, a threefingered soft hand is designed, and gripping force and stability analysis are done experimentally. DC motors are used to actuate the joints of fingers and force sensors are used to measure the internal force at contact points. PID controller is used to controlling the internal force exerted at the contact points, and the control parameters are tweaked until a satisfactory response is achieved. The minimum gripping force required to handle the object with / without external disturbances is measured. The position variables and frictional coefficients are evaluated from the contact forces at the contact points. In future, the optimization algorithm will be integrated to carry out these tasks in constrained and unconstrained environments.","Grasp stability; Isotropic hand; Multifingered hand; Prehension; Soft manipulation",,"Natarajan, E.; Faculty of Engineering, UCSI UniversityMalaysia; email: cad.elango.n@gmail.com",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Brass and copper powders were added separately ranging from 10%, 20% and 30% of its weight into the aluminium filled epoxy mix ratio. Increased density, thermal diffusivity, and thermal conductivity values were evident with a linear trend when both filler compositions were increased from 10% to 30%. Brass and copper density values of 2.22 g/cm3 and 2.08 g/cm3 respectively were recorded at the highest filler composition. Copper fillers with 30% composition in epoxy matrix exhibited the highest average value of thermal diffusivity of 1.12 mm2/s and thermal conductivity of 1.87 W/mK, while the inclusion of brass showed no significant improvement in the properties.

So, it has become imperative to detect and separate the hazardous pesticide endosulfan from contaminated water. In this work, molecularly imprinted membrane has been fabricated for the specific recognition by using methacrylic acid (MAA) as functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethyl acrylate (EGDMA) as cross-linker. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) confirmed the molecular imprinting of endosulfan on membrane matrix. Sensing of the endosulfan by voltammetry followed this. The electrochemical potential is additional information enhancing the selectivity of the sensor. It can be concluded that MIP-based voltammetric sensors are very promising analytical tool for the development of highly selective analytical sensor. The test results of electrode performance indicated that MIP endosulfanbased aluminum-carbon sensor had a detection limit of 0.02 mM, sensitive in the concentration range from 0.02 to 0.12 mM with Nernst factor > 0.059 V/decade and had good stability.","Electrochemical sensor; Endosulfan pesticide; Molecularly imprinted polymer",,"Bow, Y.; Chemical Engineering Department, State Polytechnic of SriwijayaIndia; email: yohandribow@gmail.com",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Living independently at home can be a significant challenge for the elderly, particularly for those who suffer from dementia or who have memory impairment. Assisting the elderly to live independently and safely in their own homes by providing appropriate services for them and ensuring that caregivers are immediately alerted in the event of an emergency is crucial. Utilizing context in the recommendation process will make recommendations more appropriate. A model of a context-aware-based location recommender system that can seamlessly monitor the location of the elderly and deliver appropriate location recommendations by considering context is proposed as our contribution. Two scenarios are investigated: (1) we classify location as follows: bedroom (class 1), dining room (class 2), and living room (class 3); (2) we classify location as follows: inside (class 1) and outside (class 2) the bedroom. We evaluate our proposed model using a distance measure concept by employing the cosine distance method. We compare the cosine distance method with fuzzy inference system (FIS) rules on labeled data. The results of the experiments for the first scenario show that the cosine distance has better average accuracy than the fuzzy inference system. For the second scenario, fuzzy c-means (FCM) has the same average accuracy as cosine distance. FCM has slightly better accuracy in class 1 compared to cosine distance (1% difference in accuracy), whereas cosine distance has slightly better accuracy in class 2 compared to the FCM (1% difference in accuracy). In general, we can draw the conclusion that, on this dataset, cosine distance which uses a simple algorithm produced better results than the fuzzy inference system which uses a more complex algorithm.","Context-aware; Cosine distance; Fuzzy inference system; Recommender system",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

This research proposed Multiple Support Vector Machine- Recursive Feature Elimination (MSVMRFE) as a gene selection to identify the small number of informative genes. This method is implemented in order to improve the performance of SVM during classification. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been tested on two different datasets of gene expression which are leukemia and lung cancer. In order to see the effectiveness of the proposed method, some methods such as Random Forest and C4.5 Decision Tree are compared in this paper.

In the big data analytics, it is essential that not only extracting valuable information from the big data but also processing the data rapidly. Therefore, the distributed computing systems which process the analytics concurrently with parallel programming model based distributed processing framework as well as provide data analytics related libraries get attention of researchers. Several big data analytics programming models are studied that implemented for processing and generating huge data sets. However, developing the big data analytics in the distributed computing systems with utilizing parallel processing framework needs expertise in each area. In this paper, we demonstrate there is huge gap among usages of processing units if the big data analytics are naively executed at the distributed system. And we also prove that applying proper parallelism of those methods results in 1.5 to 3.3 times improvement of execution time compared to default parallelism.","Big data analytics; Distributed computing system; Distributed processing framework; Parallel programming model",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

However continuous applications of high voltages unto the cable may lead to insulation degradations and subsequent cable failure. Since any disruption to the electricity supply may lead to economic losses as well as lowering customer satisfaction, the maintenance of cables is very important to an electrical utility company. Thus, a reliable diagnostic technique that is able to accurately assess the condition of cable insulation operating is critical, in order for cable replacement exercise to be done. One such diagnostic technique to assess the level of degradation within the cable insulation is the Polarization/Depolarization Current (PDC) analysis. This research work attempts to investigate PDC behaviour for medium voltage (MV) cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) insulated cables, via baseline PDC measurements and utilizing the measured data to simulate for PDC analysis. Once PDC simulations have been achieved, the values of conductivity of XLPE cable insulations can be approximated. Cable conductivity serves as an indicator of the level of degradation of XLPE cable insulation. It was found that for new and unused XLPE cables, the polarization and depolarization currents have almost overlapping trendlines, as the cable insulation's conduction current is negligible. Using a linear dielectric circuit equivalence model as the XLPE cable insulation and its corresponding governing equations, it is possible to optimize the number of parallel RC branches to simulate PDC analysis, with a very high degree of accuracy. The PDC simulation model has been validated against the baseline PDC measurements.","Depolarization; Insulation; Polarization; Simulation; XLPE cable",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Among the unique characteristics of adult stem cells isolated from hair follicles is their ability to differentiate into keratinocytes. Study on chitosan skin-engineered templates (SETs) as scaffolds for the proliferation of human fibroblasts have shown the promise of SETs in facilitating skin cell growth in three-dimensional culture. High proliferation in three-dimensional culture using human cells allows the researcher to extensively evaluate the cultivation of desirable cell types on chitosan SETs. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the in vitro attachment, proliferation and differentiation of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) on a chitosan SETs. HFSCs were isolated from human scalp tissues using collagenase type I prior to propagation in supplemented CnT-07 media. The phenotype of the HFSCs was verified using the markers keratin-15 (K15) and CD200, as detected by immunocytochemical staining. The attachment and proliferation of the HFSCs on the chitosan SETs were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), an alamar blue assay and a live/dead assay. Subsequently, the HFSCs were differentiated using CnT-2D differentiation media. The cells' differentiation was verified using the markers involucrin and keratin-6 (K6), as detected by immunofluorescence staining. The HFSCs were successfully isolated, proliferated and differentiated according to staining positivity and microscopy imaging.

This research was motivated by the shortage of physiotherapists which can not catch the increasing number of stroke patients. The therapy becomes less effective and less efficient since each therapist must handle too many patients during his/her work hours. This research has developed a device prototype that can help the therapy to measure and monitor patient exercise, especially at the final stage of rehabilitation when the patient gets therapy to move actively. The angle of the moving body parts that can represent the ability of patient motion was measured using accelerometers. The developed prototype was in the form of a glove, equipped with an Arduino Nano and two accelerometer modules, that measures the motion of the thumb and index finger. The device was calibrated and tested to determine the characteristics of the sensors. This test showed that the gloves prototype had an accuracy of 95,8% and precision of 99,6%. The application of the prototype was carried out on four types of finger movements, namely thumb abduction-adduction, thumb flexion-extension, finger flexion-hyperextension, and finger abductionadduction.

Moreover, the differences of metadata schema will make the difficult process of documenting, managing and disseminating this traditional knowledge. To overcome this problem, this work attempted to design specific metadata schema for a domain of traditional knowledge by utilizing metadata development methods, i.e., domain analysis, derivation analysis, system-centric analysis, user-centric analysis and resource-centric analysis. The selection of those methods based on literature review result toward research articles that presented about metadata development.

This paper experimentally examines a closed loop OHP design for heat recovery application. Therefore, an OHP was manufactured and tested to find out the thermal characteristics for heat recovery application. OHP was made from a capillary copper tube with 1.6 mm inner diameter based on the critical diameter for ethanol and methanol working fluids. The length of OHP evaporator, adiabatic and condenser were 260, 240 and 260 mm respectively. The total length of the OHP was 13.6 m and had 18 U-turns. The result showed that evaporator temperature for methanol was lower than ethanol at the high heating input. Quasi-sine wave oscillation occurs at methanol OHP (Q=64 Watt). Methanol also had the lowest thermal resistance which was 0.258 °C/W at 79.5 Watt heat input.","Ethanol; Methanol; oscillating heat pipe; Thermal performance",,"Putra, N.; Applied Heat Transfer Research Group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, FTUI, Universitas Indonesia Kampus Baru UI DepokIndonesia; email: nandyputra@eng.ui.ac.id",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Its effects occur at farm as well as regional scale. Yet some still think that the effect is only perceived by farmers directly. We proposed a simple method to describe that its effect at catchment scale is not negligible. For this purpose, we analysed an upstream catchment in West Sumatera that normally receives high rainfall up to 5000 mm per year. This catchment is in pristine condition due to its status as a national park. We used satellite and ground monitoring systems i.e. rainfall and stream water level. Satellite data such as DEM (Digital Elevation Model) used to trace river networks is acquired from ASTER GDEM in 30 m resolution. To monitor vegetation health, we used NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) on board MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Terra (daytime) MOD13Q1 (250 m resolution). Catchment delineation was performed using local land use map. Time series of EVI and NDVI was processed for the year 2015, comprising 23 datasets. Rainfall data from the year 1980 to 2012 from 9 stations and water level at the main river were analysed. We found the trace of 1997 El Nino very clearly through rainfall anomalies at all stations. As for the 2010 event, the pattern was not consistent across all rainfall stations. The 2015 event was not imminent until late October 2015. Throughout the year, NDVI remains above 0.8. In late October, maximum NDVI dropped below 0.4. This coincides with the very low water level in the stream. The same pattern was also found in two neighbouring catchments with similar land use, Kuranji and Air Dingin, and Tampo catchment. This proves that the 2015 El Nino did threatens not only farmers but also other aspects that depend on vegetation health and stream flow. Both methods are proven to be robust and may be used as an alternative way to monitor vegetation health and the impact of global climate change for ecology and water management such as domestic water use, irrigation, and flood control.","DEM; El Nino; EVI; NDVI",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

To date, manual seed inspection is carried out to separate foreign rice seed varieties in rice seed sample in the laboratory as there is lack of an automatic seed classification system. This paper describes a simple approach of using image processing technique and artificial neural network (ANN) to determine rice seed varieties based on extracted colour features of individual seed images. The experiment was conducted using 200 individual seed images of two Malaysian rice seed varieties namely MR 219 and MR 269. The acquired seed images were processed using a set of image processing procedure to enhance the image quality. Colour feature extraction was carried out to extract the red (R), green (G), blue (B), hue (H), saturation (S), value (V) and intensity (I) levels of the individual seed images. The classification using ANN was carried out by dividing the data sets into training (70% of data), validation (15%) and testing (15%) dataset respectively. The best ANN model to determine the rice seed varieties was developed, and the accuracy levels of the classification results were 67.5% and 76.7% for testing and training data sets using 40 hidden neurons.","Artificial neural network; Colour features; Machine vision; Rice varieties; Seed classification",,"Aznan, A.A.; School of Bioprocess Engineering, Universiti Malaysia PerlisMalaysia; email: aimiathirah@unimap.edu.my",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

This paper also suggests transforming the multi-label documents prior to utilizing the standard algorithm of feature selection. In such a process, the document was copied into labels that belonged to by adopting all the assigned characteristics for each label.

It is necessary to increase the performances, especially the axial ratio (Ar) of the previous antenna configured in two layers accompanying the capacitive coupling between them. If length of feeding line and width-to-length ratio of radiating patch are not matched, it can decrease the Ar performance. This paper discusses about the analysis of previous antenna (two layers) and modified antenna (one layer), optimized modified antenna using stub on coplanar-fed both single and array microstrip patch antenna for mobile satellite communication, especially for receiver antenna, Rx. The Method of Moment (MoM) is used to analyze the antenna with an infinite ground plane and substrate. The antenna is made of a thin patch conductor and a microstrip-line. The microstrip-line is located on the same layer which has the thickness h = 1.6 mm and uses a conventional substrate (relative permittivity, εr = 2.17 and loss tangent, δ = 0.0009). The patch conductor is fed by a coplanar-fed with microstrip-line to obtain a conformal configuration. The dual-fed type is to generate a left-handed circular polarization (LHCP) which is combined with an equilateral triangle patch. In this case, one of the microstrip-line feeds is set longer than the other to introduce a 900 phase delay. Moreover, the simulation results discuss about the three varies size of stub embedded on coplanar-fed and compare among of them to confirm that the antenna satisfy the target. The results of single antenna using stub-fed, especially for bandwidth of axial ratio below 3-dB and gain above 5 dBic are about 0.02 GHz and 0.065 GHz, respectively. The results of array antenna, in the case of bandwidth of axial ratio below 3-dB and gain above 5 dBic are about 0.03 GHz and 0.3 GHz, respectively. In addition, the result for axial ratio of the modified antenna and the previous antenna at 2.5025 GHz are 0.27 dB and 1.02 dB, respectively.

The wet season may adversely influence chili pepper yield in the field due to a high incidence of flower and fruit drop, and it may be more severe when it is combined with high temperature. The objective of this study might be to evaluate growth and yield of six newly developed chili pepper hybrids at three different agro climates during the wet season. The study was conducted in three locations differed mainly by elevation and soil type. They were low elevation (15 m above sea level - asl) with Ultisol, medium elevation (600 m asl) with Inceptisol, and high elevation (1000 m asl) with andosol, during the peak of rainy season, November 2014 to March 2015. In all location, the experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The hybrid genotypes evaluated were H14, H17, H20, H23, H39 and H5, and one commercial hybrid as a check, Dimas. The result showed that at low elevation, the hybrid genotype of H39 showed higher stem diameter, plant fresh and dry weight, the number of fruit and total fruit weight per plant. At medium altitude, H39 showed relatively higher plant height, stem diameter, plant dry-weight and total fruit number per plant than other hybrids did. However, total fruit weight per plant of Dimas and H20 were higher than that of other hybrids. At high elevation, plant height of H23, Dimas, or H39 was relatively superior to that of other hybrids. In term of plant fresh and dry weight, H20, H23, or H17 was superior to other hybrids. However, H20, H17, or H5 showed higher yield than other hybrids did. It seems that H39, Dimas, and H20 were more suitable at low, medium and high elevation, respectively, compared to other hybrids. Growth and yield of chili pepper grown at low elevation were lower than at medium or high altitude.

The needs for a special attention on this problem lies on the fact that most of the existing replication scheme in this computing system whether implicitly support synchronous replication and/or only consider read-only job. The problem is undoubtedly complex to be solved as two main issues need to be concerned simultaneously, i.e. 1) the difficulty on predicting the performance of the resources in terms of job response time, and 2) an efficient mechanism must be employed in order to measure the trade-off between the performance and the monetary cost incurred on resources so that minimum cost is preserved while providing low job response time. Therefore, a simple yet efficient algorithm that deals with the complexity of resource selection problem in utility-based computing systems is proposed in this paper. The problem is formulated as a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. The advantages of the algorithm are two-folds. On one fold, it hides the complexity of resource selection process without neglecting important components that affect job response time. The difficulty on estimating job response time is captured by representing them in terms of different QoS criteria levels at each resource. On the other fold, this representation further relaxed the complexity in measuring the trade-offs between the performance and the monetary cost incurred on resources. The experiments proved that our proposed resource selection scheme achieves an appealing result with good system performance and low monetary cost as compared to existing algorithms.","Asynchronous replication; Grid/cloud computing; Multi criteria decision making (MCDM) method; Resource management; Resource selection; Utility-based computing",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

In brief, the original COSP is divided into a more stable constitutive series using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). These respective sub-series are then forecasted using ARIMA and LSSVM combination method, and lastly, all forecasted components are combined back together to acquire the original forecasted series. The datasets consist of monthly COSP series from West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent North Sea (Brent). To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, several comparisons are made with the single forecasting approaches, a hybrid forecasting approach and also some existing forecasting approaches that utilize COSP series as the dataset by comparing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) acquired. From the results, the proposed approach has managed to outperform the other approaches with smaller MAE and RMSE values which signify better forecasting accuracy. Ultimately, the study proves that the integration of data decomposition with forecasting combination method could increase the accuracy of COSP series forecasting.","Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA); Crude oil spot prices; Discrete wavelet transform; Hybrid forecasting method; Least square support vector machine (LSSVM)",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The issue in text representation is to generate a formal approach of capturing meaning or semantics in sentences. This issue includes heterogeneity and inconsistency in the text. Polysemous, synonymous, morphemes and homonymous word pose serious drawbacks when trying to capture senses in sentences. This calls for a need to capture and represent senses in order to resolve vagueness and improve understanding of senses in documents for knowledge creation purposes. We introduce a simple and straightforward method to capture the canonical form of sentences. The proposed method first identifies the canonical forms using the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) technique and later applies the First Order Predicate Logic (FOPL) scheme to represent the identified canonical forms. We adopted two algorithms in WSD, which are Lesk and Selectional Preference Restriction. These algorithms concentrate mainly on disambiguating senses in words, phrases, and sentences. In addition, we adopted the First Order Predicate Logic scheme to analyse argument predicate in sentences, employing the consequence logic theorem to test for satisfiability, validity, and completeness of information in sentences.","Canonical form; First order predicate logic; Natural language processing; Semantic; Word sense disambiguation",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

In the literature, these children are referred to as children with special educational needs. Only few researchers are involved in the development of various computer technologies, including mobile applications appropriate for these children. Some specialized mobile applications for these users can be found in the different mobile stores. However, most of these apps are rather expensive or with inappropriate user interfaces.

The research was conducted from February to April 2016 in Rejang Lebong, geographically lying on 102°19'-102°57' Lat., 2°22'07''- 3°31' Long., covering of 155,504.81 ha. Land functions of the district are covered by of Bukit Daun and Bukit Balai Rejang protected forests, Kerinci Seblat National Park, Bukit Kaba Tourism Natural Forest Park, and agricultural cultivation areas. To define land suitability for red potato cultivation in Rejang Lebong areas based on suitable temperature following adaptation experiment results of red potato planted in the medium altitude of Bengkulu Province conducting previously. Spatial analysis for calculating areas of potentially suitable cultivation for red potato was based on overlaying from attributes of the suitable temperature, rainfall, and some soil characteristics. Initial suitable land for potato plantation in Rejang Lebong covered about ha 46,608.98 ha or 29.97 % of the district area with agriculture land function of 11,954.59 ha or 7.69% of the district, and forest land use of 34,654.39 ha or 22.28% of the district.

Potentially suitable land for potato cultivation in Rejang Lebong after correcting with reference of suitable temperature covered double more of the agriculture land than that of the initial. Therefore, in one hand, Rejang Lebong as a central of potato production in Bengkulu has some opportunities to increase potato production for supplying potato demand from surrounding areas in the future. On the other, attempt to increase potato production in Rejang Lebong have to consider environmental aspects and protected conservation forest areas.","Conservation forests; Land suitable areas; Medium altitude; Red potato",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The common solution to enhance the searching process includes the deployment of formal concept analysis (FCA) theory to extract concepts from a set of text with the use of corresponding domain ontology. However, creating a domain ontology or cross-platform ontology is a tedious and time-consuming process that requires validation from domain experts. Therefore, this study proposed an alternative solution called Lattice Mining (LM) that utilizes FCA theory and graph theory. This is because the process of matching a query to related documents is similar to the process of graph matching if both the query and the documents are represented using graphs. This study adopted the idea of FCA in the determination of the concepts based on texts and deployed the lattice diagrams obtained from an FCA tool for further analysis using graph theory. The LM technique employed in this study utilized the adjacency matrices obtained from the lattice outputs and performed a distance measure technique to calculate the similarity between two graphs. The process was realized successively via the implementation of three algorithms called the Relatedness Algorithm (RA), the Adjacency Matrix Algorithm (AMA) and the Concept-Based Lattice Mining (CBLM) Algorithm. A similarity measure between FCA output lattices yielded promising results based on the ranking of the trace values from the matrices.","Adjacency matrix; Formal concept analysis; Graph theory; Text mining",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

This article presents the results of research on the effect of voltage and wetting intensity on the leakage current level of a 20-kV silicone-rubber post-insulator. The leakage current has been observed under dry and wet conditions. The experiment has been conducted using the voltage level variation of 5 kV in the range between 10 kV and 30 kV, using four variations of wetting intensity.

A number of studies discussing the problem and some methods dealing with its solution are analyzed. Recursion and iteration are approaches used in computer programs to implement different algorithms. An iterative approach is the repeated execution of the same source code until a certain end condition is met. On the other hand, a recursive approach uses a recursive function that repeatedly calls itself. This function contains a source code that must be executed repeatedly. Both algorithms presented in this paper can be used to generate permutations of an n element set. The algorithms are modified so that they can be used to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) with a small number of vertices. Several publications that discuss the TSP and some approaches to its solution are also presented. The methodology and the conditions for conducting the experiments are described in details. The obtained results have been analyzed; they show that for the same conditions the iterative algorithm works from of 23 to 24 times faster than the recursive algorithm in all the tested input data. Several approaches to optimize the two algorithms in terms of the number of permutations tested when searching a minimal Hamiltonian cycle are presented.","Computer programming; Iterative algorithm; Recursive algorithm; Travelling salesman problem",,"Kralev, V.; Department of Informatics, South-West University 'Neofit Rilski', 66 Ivan Michailov Str., Bulgaria; email: velin_kralev@swu.bg",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Thus, high-energy dense foods become the preferences compared to high nutritional content foods due to their cheaper price. The present study aims to develop healthy and palatable diet at the minimum cost based on Malaysian Dietary Guidelines 2010 and Recommended Nutrient Intake 2005 via linear programming. A total of 96 female adults from low socioeconomic families in Johor, South East Malaysia have been recruited for the present study. Anthropometric measurement; weight and height, socio-demographic information and 3-days food record have been collected from the subjects. In addition, data on food prices have also been collected. Then, a linear programming model has been developed to select the cheapest food combinations that could fulfil all the nutritional recommendations and palatable constraints in order to capture common dietary habit of the locals. Subsequently, healthy seven-days menus have been created using the optimal food servings estimated from the linear programming model. Dietary data have shown that the average energy intake among low-income adult women (1871 ± 317 kcal/day) is less than the nutrient recommendation. Thus, from the linear programming analysis, the minimum food cost has been estimated at RM6.55 (2.15 USD) for the total energy intake of 2000 kcal per day for a female adult which meets the recommendation of MDG 2010 and RNI 2005. In conclusion, linear programming may be a useful tool to develop healthy and palatable diets at a minimal cost in managing dietary problems among low socioeconomic groups where food expenditure becomes an important restraining factor. Eventually, low socioeconomics female adults would improve their nutritional intake by making wiser food choices to meet all the nutritional requirements, which lead to healthier life.","Constraints; Healthy diet; Linear programming; Socioeconomic status",,"Rajikan, R.; School of Healthcare Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Kebangsaan MalaysiaMalaysia; email: roslee@ukm.edu.my",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The results of the ST are the parameters of instantaneous means square voltage (VRMS (t)), instantaneous direct current voltage (VDC (t)) and instantaneous alternating current voltage (VAC (t)) extracted from the time-frequency representation (TFR). Simulation through MATLAB has been conducted using equivalent circuit model (ECM), using 12 V lead acid (LA) battery with capacities from 1.0 Ah to 10.0 Ah. For the battery model, charging/discharging signal has been used to estimate the battery parameters from the ST technique to determine battery characteristics. From the signal characteristics of battery capacity versus VAC (t) obtained, new equation is proposed based on the curve fitting tool.

Typically, cloud computing providers offer virtual machines to cloud users with static configurations, and these configurations are not changed until virtual machines are shutting down. To accelerate parallel processing computations in cloud computing environments, we design and implement a dynamic resource manager by isolating resources based on workload types. To avoid unnecessary context switching and increase CPUs affinity, our dynamic resource manager determines whether vCPU to physical CPU core pinning is required. If so, the VM's vCPUs are pinned by our dynamic resource manager, which can guarantee the resource and performance isolation. With our proposed resource manager for virtual machines, we can achieve a performance boost and load balancing at the same time.

Therefore, to reduce electricity consumption without sacrificing comfort and improving indoor air quality, the utilizing of heat pipe heat exchanger (HPHE) is necessary and highly recommended. An experimental study was conducted to investigate the thermal performance of heat pipe in recovering the heat of an exhaust air from a room simulator. HPHE consisted of several tubular heat pipes with water as a working fluid and staggered by up to six rows. The outer diameter of each heat pipe was 13 mm and length of 700 mm with fins mounted on each heat pipe. A series of experiments was conducted to determine the effect of inlet air temperature. The influence of the number of heat pipe rows and air velocity was also investigated. The experiments showed that the higher inlet air temperature, the more effective the HPHE performance became. The cooling capacity of the system had increased. It was indicated by the decrease of air temperature entering the evaporator by 2.4 °C with the effectiveness of 0.15. This result was achieved when using six rows HPHE, air velocity 1 m/s, and evaporator inlet air temperature 45 °C. When air velocity was doubled to 2 m/s, the system reached the largest amount of heat recovered of 1404.29 kJ/hour.

Consequently, the process of learning material selection is hard to be algorithmized, therefore, intelligent methods are applied to handle the complexity challenges. This research proposes a significance weight approach that represents the complex dependency of learning material selection problem to substitute the rules definition in the selection process. In addition, this research proposes an intelligent learning model that combines unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to accurately select the learning material for a particular student adaptively. The unsupervised machine learning technique is vital in obtaining a learning material classification and labelling based on the proposed significance weight. Meanwhile, the supervised machine learning technique, the Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Networks conducts the adaptation process that will assign the student to suitable learning materials regarding his performance upon specific DKC. With 98% achievement of classification accuracies, this model can be considered as highly accurate in selecting a correct and suitable learning material based on student's domain knowledge level.","Adaptive e-learning; Domain knowledge concept; Learning material selection; Supervised machine learning",,"Idris, N.; Department of Software Engineering, Faculty of Computing, Universiti Teknologi MalaysiaMalaysia; email: norsham@utm.my",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The study involved the development of permanent magnet linear generator designs with the variation on aluminium spacer utilization as part of the magnet assembly and alternate slot winding usage instead of conventional winding arrangement. The proposed designs were simulated using Finite Element Method (FEM) software to attain the results on flux distribution, air-gap flux density, and open circuit results. The total weight and material cost of each design were also estimated. These results are significant in finding the acceptable design's alternatives to counter the need of huge and heavy linear generator in wave energy converter system. Comparative studies on simulation results and calculated data were conducted between the alternative and conventional design. It is found out that alternate slot winding design improves the performance of conventional design with no impact on design's weight and material cost while aluminium spacer design yields more significant negative results on the performance than the positive effects in term of design's weight and material cost.","Alternate slot winding; Finite Element Method (FEM); Linear generator; Wave energy converter",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The performance of the e-nose was then evaluated to classify the quality levels of black tea (Q1, Q2, and Q3). The black tea samples were purchased from Tambi Tea Industry in Central Java, Indonesia. Here, the quality is based on the information from the factory. For each quality level, the measurement was repeated 31 times. Therefore, the total of measurements is 93, and only six sensors, i.e. MQ-7, TGS 813, TGS 2602, TGS 826, TGS 2620 and TGS 825 have the high influence on the patterns differentiation. It is found that the e-nose is not able to distinguish the three quality levels of black tea correctly when applying without heating treatment. In this condition, only 88.9% of cross-validated grouped are correctly classified. On the other hand, for the black tea sample with unstable heating, the performance of the e-nose has been improved. In this case, 92.5% of crossvalidated grouped are correctly classified. Moreover, for the black tea sample with stable heating treatment, all samples are separated where 97.8% of cross-validated grouped are correctly classified.

However, the capacitor parasitic, namely equivalent series resistance (ESR), may cause unstable VR operation. VR characterization in terms of ESR suggests stable range of capacitor ESR based on the ESR tunnel graph in the VR datasheet. Specifically, the stable ESR range is the critical ESR value, which lies on the failure region boundary of ESR tunnel graph. New or updated ESR tunnel graph through characterization is required for new product development or quality assurance purpose. However, the characterization is typically conducted manually in industry, thereby increases the manufacturing time and cost. Therefore, this work proposed a characterization approach that can reduce the time to determine the ESR tunnel graph based on the hybrid system identification and neural network (SI-NN) approach. This method utilised system identification (SI) to estimate the VR circuit model for certain operating points before predicting the transfer function coefficients for the remaining points using radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). Eventually, the critical ESR of failure region boundary was estimated. This hybrid SI-NN approach able to reduce the number of data that would be acquired manually to 25% compared to manual characterization, while provides critical ESR estimation with error less than 2%.","Equivalent series resistance; Failure region boundary; Output capacitor; Radial basis function neural network; System identification; Voltage regulator",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes of soil organic fractions and nutrients after application of treated palm oil mill effluent. The treatments consisted of control and effluent application at rates of 5, 10, 15 and 20 ton ha-1. The treatments were arranged in a completely randomized design with three replications. Application of effluent significantly increased total organic C, labile organic C, humic acid C, pH, total N, available P, and exchangeable K. A significant reduction of exchangeable Al also occurred with effluent application. The increases of total organic C and labile organic were found with the application of 20 t ha-1 of effluent, but the increase was not significant compared to the effluent application at rates of 10 and 15 t ha-1. Sensitivity indexes of total organic C, labile organic C and humic acid C following effluent application were 24-66%, 103-197% and 95-114% respectively in which labile organic C showed the highest sensitivity index. Total organic C, labile organic C and humic acid were positively correlated with increasing rates of effluent application. Labile organic C revealed the strongest relationship (R2=0.91) with effluent application compared to total organic C (R2=0.88) and humic acid (R2=0.67). A significant increase of total N was only found by the effluent application at rate of 20 t ha-1. Significant increases in available P and exchangeable K occurred at rate of 10, 15 and 20 t ha-1. It can be concluded that the increase in soil organic carbon levels was related to the amount of organic (effluent) input added to the soil.

Sawdust filled with CaCO3 fire retardant is potential to be applied for building insulation to conserve heat energy across the insulation so that to reduce electrical energy consumption for the building. An apparatus for measuring burning path of sawdust filled with CaCO3 fire retardant has been constructed. Heat flux meter was also constructed to measure thermal conductivity and thermal resistance of the sawdust insulation. The composition of CaCO3 fire retardant in sawdust mixture used in the experiment ranged from 5 % to 30 % and 100 % sawdust was used as a control. The burning path and burning time were measured for each composition of CaCO3 and for the control, as well as, burning velocity was determined. Thermal data of the sawdust insulation was determined for the density of 43.25 kg/m3 and 64.88 kg/m3 with a thickness of the insulation from 2 cm to 8 cm. The burning path, as well as, burning time decreased as the composition of CaCO3 fire retardant increased with the smallest one of 1.25 cm and 5 minutes achieved for CaCO3 30 %. The lowest burning velocity was achieved at CaCO3 30 %. Thermal conductivity and thermal resistance increased with the increase of the thickness of the sawdust insulation. The highest thermal conductivity of 0.553 W/mK and the highest thermal resistance of 0.145 m2K/W achieved at 8 cm thickness of the insulation and density of 43.25 kg/m3, while at density of 64.875 kg/m3, the highest thermal conductivity was 0.398 W/mK and the highest thermal resistance of 0.201m2K/W.","burning path; Burning time; Fire retardant; Sawdust insulation; Thermal conductivity; Thermal insulation for building; Thermal resistance",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

One of the most popular techniques used in database design is the relational technique, which focuses on entity relationship diagram and normalization. The relational technique is useful for eliminating data redundancy because normalization produces normal forms on the schema tables. The second technique is the object-oriented technique, which focuses on a class diagram and generating schema tables. An advantage of the object-oriented technique is its close implementation to programming languages like C++ or Java. This paper is set to compare the performance of both relational and object-oriented techniques in terms of solving data redundancy during the database design phase as well as measuring query execution time. The experimental results based on a course database case study traced 186 redundant records using the relational technique and 204 redundant records when using the objectoriented technique.

It was shown that the changes of the width and thickness of the Al plate increased the temperature gradient between hot and cold sides of TEG. This directly increase the voltage produced by the TEG based on the Seeback effect. The increase of the thermal gradient due to the increment of thickness and width of Al plate might be because of the increase of thermal resistance of Al plate.

Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) retransmission at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer of LTE networks achieves error-free data transmission. The performance of the LTE networks mainly depends on how effectively this HARQ adopted in the latest communication standard, Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS).

It also maps all 3D models into the same dimension. Based on this fact, a novel voxel pattern based is proposed by considering local pattern on a voxel called local color voxel pattern (LCVP). Voxels textured is observed by considering voxel to its neighbors. LCVP is computed around each voxel to its neighbors. LCVP value will indicate uniq pattern on each 3D models. LCVP also quantizes color on each voxel to generate a specific pattern. Shift and reflection circular also will be done. In an additional way, inspired by promising recent results from image processing, this paper also implement spatial pattern which utilizing Weber, Oriented Gradient to extract global spatial descriptor. Finally, a combination of local spectra and spatial and established global features approach called multi fourier descriptor are proposed. For optimal retrieval, the rank combination is performed between local and global approaches. Experiments were performed by using dataset SHREC'13 and SHREC'14 and showed that the proposed method could outperform some performances to state-of-the-art.","3D texture; Fourier descriptor; Spatial pattern; Voxel pattern",,"Martono, H.Y.; Department of Informatics and Computer Engineering, Electronics Engineering Polytechnic Institute of Surabaya, On Raya-ITS street, Indonesia; email: hero@pens.ac.id",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

It is one of the major steps in image enhancement and restoration. This filtering technique can remove noise and preserve the details of the image for feature extraction processes. However, filtering process can still be considered as a huge challenge for image filtering technique. Common noises in the image such as Salt &amp; Pepper, Gaussian, Speckle, and Poisson Noise are still posing problems in filtering process where the quality and the originality of the images can be degraded and disturbed. Meanwhile, a single filtering technique is usually fit to deal with only certain specific noise. This paper presents an enhanced Hybrid Median Filter (H6F) technique to improve image filtering process. The technique involves 3x3 sub-mask and determination of new pixel value from the median value of the three steps which are the median calculation of '+'-neighbours, median calculation of all sub-masks and selection of centre pixel value. The H6F technique has been computed on lead frame inspection system. The results have shown that the technique has been able to remove multi-type of noises efficiently and produce exceptionally low Mean-Square Error (MSE) while consuming the acceptable amount of execution time when compared to other filtering techniques.","Hybrid median filter; Image filtering; Multi-type noise",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Soil water content can be determined directly using the gravimetrical method by calculating the loss of water when the soil dries out, and indirectly by measuring other variables from which soil water can be calculated. The indirect methods have some advantages when compared to the direct gravimetrical method because measured; non-destructive soil water data are available instantly. Soil dielectric properties have strong relationships with soil water content and have been used widely as indirect methods of soil water determination, but the cost of the available instrument is too expensive for small-scale farmers. Two studies were conducted in 2011 and 2015 to develop a quick, cheap method to determine in-situ soil water content and precise water use by crops. The method applied a non-linear relation between soil water content (θ, in gg-1) and soil electrical impedance (Z, in kω) as follows: θ = a. Zb where a and b are constants. Parameter Z showed a good predictor for soil water content (R ≥ 0.90) therefore can be used to determine soil water content in the field quickly. The dielectric method has been successfully used to determine the water balance in the vegetated soils, in wich changes in soil water content caused by daily rainfall as low as 10 mm was detected up to the depth of 60 cm. The method was also successfully capable of calculating the amount of water used by palm oil nursery grown in media with different levels of soil organic matter.","Dielectric method; In-situ soil water; Sustainable agriculture; Water use",,"Hermawan, B.; Department of Soil Science, University of Bengkulu, Jalan WR.

The Power Plant Voltage Controller is part of the hierarchical voltage control system which consists of Tertiary Voltage Control (TVC) at the higher control level and then followed by Secondary Voltage Control (SVC) as a regional controller and Primary Voltage Control (PVC) at the lowest control level to perform the control command. In this control approach, PPVC participates in the lowest control level in the Coordinated Voltage Control (CVC) system. The Power Plant Voltage Control regulators are autonomous controllers that regulate the high-side bus of the power plant while maintaining balanced VAR generation of the individual units and avoiding the dynamic interaction among multiple controlled generators. This paper presents a method of controlling the terminal voltage of the generators at the power plant by utilizing a quasi-steady-state sensitivity to get a control parameter for the PPVC. Using a simple control strategy, an adaptive control can be achieved by periodically calculating the quasi-steady-state sensitivity to update the control parameter, in such a way the PPVC control parameter not only can adapt to the variation of the interconnected network but also with the fluctuation of the load demands.","Coordinated voltage control; High-side voltage control; Power plant voltage regulator; Quasi-steady-state sensitivity",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The design mix of the foamed concrete was targeted to achieve a density of 1500 kg/m3. Six different water-cement ratios (w/c) range from 0.30 to 0.40 were taken into consideration. Three different group of LFC with 0% PP, 0.25% PP and 0.40% PP are prepared. The optimum w/c was determined by comparing the compressive test result of different percentage polypropylene fiber. By using the LFC with optimum w/c ratio and designated amount of PP of 3:1 c/s ratios, the concrete specimens were tested with splitting tensile test to determine the effects of PP to the tensile strength of the lightweight foamed concrete. From the result, it is found that by using 2:1 c/s ratio, the optimum w/c of mix with 0% PP, 0.25% PP and 0.40% PP are 0.36, 0.34 and 0.32 respectively, while for c/s equals to 3:1, the optimum w/c are 0.34, 0.32 and 0.32 respectively. From the splitting tensile result, under a controlled density of 1500 ± 50 kg/m3, the tensile strength range of 0.991-2.138 MPa was observed. From the result, it can be concluded that the addition of polypropylene fiber to the lightweight foamed concrete does affect the tensile strength of the foamed concrete. However the further addition of PP will not cause any positive and significant effect to the tensile strength of lightweight foamed concrete.","Cement-sand ratio; Compressive strength; Lightweight foamed concrete; Polypropylene fiber; Splitting tensile strength; Water-cement ratio",,"Tan, C.S.; Forensic Engineering Centre, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, UTMMalaysia; email: tcsiang@utm.my",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

However, the performance of iris recognition is still doubted whether the iris recognition can generate higher accuracy when involving twin iris data. So, specific research by using twin data only needs to be done to measure the performance of recognition.

This approach also improves the throughput of the system along with other attributes such as rate of delivering data packet to the base station (BS) and overall energy dissipation of the sensor nodes in the network. This in turn results in the increased network lifetime. As the sensor nodes are operated by battery or some other source, this introduces a constraint in energy resource. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop a novel approach to overcome this constraint, since this phenomenon leads to the degradation of the network. The swarm intelligence approach is able to cope with all such pitfalls of WSNs. In this paper, we have presented a cluster-head (CH) selection technique which is based on swarm optimization with the main aim to increase the overall network lifetime. The proposed approach gives higher effects with regards to power utilization of nodes, data packets received at BS and stability period, and for this reason serves to be a higher performer as compared to Stable Election Protocol (SEP) and Enhance Threshold Sensitive Stable Election Protocol (ETSSEP).

The key challenge behind holistic schema matching lies in selecting an appropriate method that has the ability to maintain effectiveness and efficiency. Effectiveness refers to the quality of matching while efficiency refers to the time and memory consumed within the matching process. Several approaches have been proposed for holistic schema matching. These approaches were mainly dependent on clustering techniques. In fact, clustering aims to group the similar fields within the schemas in multiple groups or clusters. However, fields on schemas contain much complicated semantic relations due to schema level. Ontology which is a hierarchy of taxonomies has the ability to identify semantic correspondences with various levels. Hence, this study aims to propose an ontology-based clustering approach for holistic schema matching. Two datasets have been used from ICQ query interfaces consisting of 40 interfaces, which refer to Airfare and Job. The ontology used in this study has been built using the XBenchMatch which is a benchmark lexicon that contains rich semantic correspondences for the field of schema matching. In order to accommodate the schema matching using the ontology, a rule-based clustering approach is used with multiple distance measures including Dice, Cosine, and Jaccard. The evaluation has been conducted using the common information retrieval metrics; precision, recall, and f-measure. In order to assess the performance of the proposed ontology-based clustering, a comparison among two experiments has been performed. The first experiment aims to conduct the ontology-based clustering approach (i.e. using ontology and rule-based clustering), while the second experiment aims to conduct the traditional clustering approaches without the use of ontology. Results show that the proposed ontology-based clustering approach has outperformed the traditional clustering approaches without ontology by achieving an fmeasure of 94% for Airfare and 92% for Job datasets. This emphasizes the strength of ontology in terms of identifying correspondences with semantic level variation.","Automatic schema matching; Clustering; Large-scale data; Ontology; Web interfaces",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Economic dispatch requires reliable technique to achieve minimal cost; otherwise, a non-optimal solution may cause non-economic electricity generation to the utility. Single area economic dispatch does not make complete electricity generation of the whole system on the electrical transmission network. Thus, multi-area economic dispatch implementation leads to complete consideration for power transmission system. This paper presents multi-area economic dispatch performance using swarm intelligence technique. In this study, swarm intelligence technique, namely the particle swarm optimization technique (PSO) is employed for solving multi-area economic dispatch problems. The algorithm is tested on a 2-area 48-bus power system with different case studies. Variation in active power loading in achieving an optimal solution is also considered in this study. Several trials were taken into consideration to assess the consistency of results.

Nonetheless, the extensive analysis should be conducted upon RE integration into the existing power system. This paper assesses its economic impact on the power system. Setting up RE technology such as photovoltaic and wind turbine are costly, yet may reduce generator's fuel cost in the long run. Thus, economic load dispatch (ELD) is conducted to compute the operating cost of power system with the integration of RE system. In this study, the operating cost represents the fuel cost of conventional fossil-fuel generators.

However, the coolant or lubrication media used in MQL technique posed certain restrictions especially at very high cutting speeds where the lubricating oil tends to evaporates as it strikes the already heated cutting tool at elevated temperature. Desire to compensate for the shortcomings of the lubricating media in the MQL technique led to the introduction of nanoparticles in the cutting fluids for use in the MQL lubrication process. Nanoparticles have much higher and stronger temperature-dependent thermal conductivity and enhanced heat transfer coefficient at very low particle concentration, which are key parameters for their enhanced performance in many of the machining applications. Optimizing the nanoparticles concentration leads to efficiency in most of their application. Their ball bearing effect lubrication at the cutting zone through formation of film layer which reduces friction between the contact surfaces thereby reducing cutting force, temperature and tool wear. It has been reported in various studies that nanoparticles introduction in cutting fluids led to excellent machining performance in reduction of cutting forces, reduced tool wear, reduced cutting temperature and improved surface finish of the work piece thereby increasing productivity and reduction of hazards to the health of personnel and the environment better than the pure or conventional MQL process.

Cell decomposition algorithm is an algorithm derived from graph theory used to create maps of robot formations. A Fuzzy algorithm is an artificial intelligence control algorithm used for robot navigation. The merger of these two algorithms is not able to form an optimum formation because some Quadrotors which have been hovering should wait for the other Quadrotors which are unable to find the shortest distance to reach the formation quickly. The problem is that the longer time the multi Quadrotors taking to make a formation, the more energy they use. It can be overcome by adding potential field algorithm. The algorithm is used to give values of weight to the path planning taken by the Quadrotors.

Zeolites and clay were modified into ceramic adsorbent to adsorb heavy metal pollutant that is hexavalent chromium Cr (VI) contained in electroplating industrial effluents. Zeolite and clay were mixed evenly and molded into small balls with 5-6 mm diameter and dried at 1000°C for 48 hrs. This adsorbent was activated with HCl 32% solution for 1 hr to enhance its adsorption potential. Ten samples with various ratios of zeolite:clay (3:37-12:28) with the total adsorbent mass of 1000 g was examined. Cr (VI) uptake in liquid wastewater was studied by varying contact time and the ratio of zeolite and clay. The effect of activation treatment with HCl 32% solution on adsorption performance of zeolite ceramic adsorbent was also investigated. Analysis of wastewater output indicates a reduction of hexavalent chromium concentration reaches 99.45% at contact time 10 h with 12:28 ratio of activated adsorbent.

Using Footprint, the user would only need to point the mobile phone camera on a specific spot, and Footprint will overlay all in-formation on geo-tagged tourism objects as far as 30 meters away. The user is also able to filter search information based on the data source of information (such as Google or Wiki) or based on the category (such as Food or Landmark). It is hoped that this experience would one day become a trend, as when more reality-environments will be shaped into surreal, yet virtual alternatives through Internet of Things (IoT), and there will be more ubiquitous resource access through many devices, networks, and user content.","Android; Information seeking; Mixed reality; Tourism",,"Mustapha, A.; Soft Computing and Data Mining Centre, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn MalaysiaMalaysia; email: aidam@uthm.edu.my",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Over the years, many improved modifications of the BP learning algorithm have been made by researchers, but the local minima problem remains unresolved. Therefore, to resolve the inherent problems of BP algorithm, this paper proposed BPGD-A3T algorithm where the approach introduces three adaptive parameters which are gain, momentum and learning rate in BP. The performance of the proposed BPGD-A3T algorithm is then compared with BPGD two-term parameters (BPGD-2T), BP with adaptive gain (BPGD-AG) and conventional BP algorithm (BPGD) by means of simulations on classification datasets.

The existence of high similarity in colour and textures of both copied and pasted images caused the detection of the tampered region to be very difficult. Additionally, the existence of post-processing methods makes it more challenging.

Consequently, the environmental and social issues including water-related problems have become a major concern. Inevitably, water consumption in this sector is very important to be analyzed. Water footprint is one of the methods that can be used as a tool for the sustainable appropriation of freshwater resources. Here we investigated the water footprint in both oil palm cultivation and milling processes carried out by PTP Mitra Ogan, the largest plantation companies in South Sumatera. The goal eventually was to formulate the strategies to reduce the water footprint in the palm oil production based on the best practice criteria. This study reveals that the total water footprint of oil palm done by PTP Mitra Ogan (487 ton) is 980.9 m3/ton, while that of Crude Palm Oil (CPO) (5.7 ton) is 3,818.6 m3 / ton and processing kernel (0.74 ton) is 2,174.3 m3 / ton. This study reveals that the intensive use of inorganic fertilizers during the cultivation process caused the high value of the water footprint in the farming stage, so that the use of inorganic fertilizers must be controlled. In the industrial processes, total water use in all stages of the production of CPO and kernel was 1.36 m3 / ton of fresh fruit bunch produced, whereas the wastewater produce was approximately 306.81 m3/ton. It reveals that there was an inefficient use of water in the milling processes so that the implementation of the steam accumulator and reuse of wastewater discharged can be alternatives in reducing the water footprint in the palm oil milling process for better water resource management.","Palm oil; Sustainable water resources; Water footprint; Water resource management",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Activated carbon has been known for so many years as an effective adsorbent, but its use to adsorb heavy metals in acid mine drainage needs improvements to meet our expectation, chemical activation is one of the methods should be applied to enhance its adsorption capacity. The adsorbent is activated using alkali solution of NaOH 48% to fill its negative charge to enhance its ability in capturing heavy metallic cations contained in acid mine drainage. This research has proved that the adsorbent used is highly effective to reduce heavy metals pollutant in acid mine drainage, its adsorption capacity reaches most favorable results of 72.33% for Mn and 98.81% for Al at activated carbon:clay ratio 11:29 on contact time 300 min where pH increase is from 4 to 7.1.

Building material is one of the important roles on that issue. Bamboo can be regarded as a sustainable construction material. Whilst, bamboo is considered as low-class material, even called as ""the poor man timber"" by many modern builders. Applying bamboo in contemporary design architecture effectively revamp the bamboo's image. Nowadays, contemporary bamboo architects are exploring the organic building form, which requires curved structural elements. Sometimes, the natural bamboo's curvature cannot fulfill the architects' demands. Therefore, it's required a technique to curve the element, one of which is using bundled bamboo split (BBS). The research issues are the effect of using BBS to formal-spatial function and mechanical function; and the effect of bamboo species and bundle's interval to BBS's compression strength. This experimental research was held in two kinds of experiments. Firstly, design and build experiments: implementing BBS into three types of curve structural elements. Secondly, laboratory-test experiments: comparing BBS's compression strength based on bamboo species and bundle's interval. This research could be concluded that (1) considering from formal function, using BBS as the structural element is very beneficial for a building with organic form; (2) considering from spatial function, Using BBS is appropriate to its function as dynamic spatial elements which contribute in creating atmosphere through its texture and color; and (3) considering from mechanical function, the selection of bamboo species and the bundle's interval will affect the BBS' compression strength. To get a higher compression strength, BBS can use bambu gombong with smaller bundle's interval. Due to its compression strength, BBS is not recommended to be structural elements that distribute the pure compression load.","Bundled-bamboo-split (BBS); Compression strength; Curved structural element",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The industrial processing of this fruit produces seeds and peels as waste materials. The aim of this work was to determine the physical-chemical properties of fermented-roasted Rambutan seed fat (RSF) and its mixtures with Cocoa butter (CB) in term of viscosity, texture (hardness), thermal stability, and fatty acid composition, and free fatty acid, acid value. The mixtures M3, M4, and RSF which possess similar crystal formation showed almost similar hardness index in the range of 11.18 to 24.77. The mixtures M1 and CB exhibited higher hardness index than M2, M3, M4 and RSF in the range of 57.55 to 63.85. The results showed that a low viscosity was observed in the mixture CB and M1 with increasing the temperatures at 35, 40 and 50 oC whereas, a high viscosity was observed in the other mixture such as M3, M4, and RSF with increasing the temperature, respectively. The result found that the major fatty acid composition was present in CB (100%CB+0%RSF) and M1 (80%CB+20%RSF), such as palmitic, stearic and oleic acid, respectively. The results showed no significant differences (P > 0.05) in FFA among CB (2.72±0.65%), M1 (3.01±0.32%) and M2 (3.47±0.16%).

Therefore, polyunsaturated bonds in the fatty acid chains should be hydrogenated into monounsaturated ones. The conventional method using hydrogen (direct hydrogenation) at relatively high temperature and pressure with the aid of nickel as a catalyst, which prone to explosion due to the presence of free gaseous hydrogen at high temperature and pressure. Catalytic transfer-hydrogenation (CTH) therefore is proposed as a promising alternative method, enabling CTH at room condition without the presence of free hydrogen. This research is focused on exploring effects of temperature and reaction time to iodine value reduction on CTH of candlenut oil, including the kinetics of its methyl ester. The hydrogenation utilizes Ag-Ni/silica 150 Å as catalyst and potassium formate (6M) as hydrogen donor. Three reaction temperatures were selected (40°C, 60°C, and 78°C), where each reaction was performed for 4, 8, 12 and 16 hours. Hydrogenation was performed in a batch reactor using isopropyl alcohol as a solvent. Results showed that iodine values decreased with the increase of temperature and longer reaction time. The iodine value was still decreasing at 16 hours reaction time, indicating the possibility of longer reaction time. However, at 16 hours time, the iodine value yield has been within standard biodiesel range (Indonesian National Standard). The hydrogenation was first order reaction towards methyl ester double bonds concentration.

As yet little is known about the photosynthetic characteristics of many cultivars of maize in Indonesia when waterlogged at various stages of growth. This research aimed to determine the photosynthesis tolerance of some maize cultivars to inundation that occurred at different stages of growth. The factorial completely randomized block design with two factors and three replications was used. The first factor consisted of nine maize cultivars, i.e. Bisi 2, Pioneer 21, Gumarang, Bisma, Sukmaraga, Srikandi Kuning 1, Bima 2, Bima 4, and Bima 5. The second was waterlogged conditions at different stages of growth i.e. the vegetative phase (leaved-four stage- - V4 stage), the early phase of reproduction (silk phase - R1 stage), and the middle phase of reproduction (milk stage - R3 stage), and no water logging as the control. During the period of waterlogging, the water level of 5 cm was maintained for 10 days. The results showed that no interaction effect between maize cultivars and waterlogging conditions to almost all photosynthesis variable except stomatal aperture. Ten days of waterlogging at different stages of growth affected photosynthesis by decreasing the chlorophyll content (a, b and total), photosynthetic rate, and the stomatal aperture width. The R1 stage was the stage of growth sensitive to photosynthesis when waterlogged. Bisma cultivar is the maize cultivar that is not tolerant to waterlogging stress at the V4 stage and Gumarang is not tolerant at the R3 stage. It showed a low rate of photosynthesis. At the R1 stage, Bima 5 and Bima 2 cultivars are the maize cultivars that are tolerant to waterlogging stress, while at the R3 stage all cultivars are tolerant except Gumarang. Therefore, Bima 5 and Bima 2 cultivars can be recommended to be planted in the swampy areas.","Cultivar; Maize; Photosynthesis; Tolerance; Waterlogging",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Shifting a paradigm in education from teacher learning to student learning center has encouraged that learning should follow and tailor learners' characteristics in the form of personalized e-learning. There are several aspects to describe a condition of learners such as prior knowledge, learning goals, learning styles, cognitive ability, learning interest, and motivation. Even though, in many studies of the personalized e-learning, the learning style plays a significant role. In terms of elearning, implementing several methods for identifying learner style becomes more challenging. Artificial intelligence and machine learning method give good accuracy, but they still have some issues in computation. Additionally, the stationary method is very hard to represent non-deterministic and dynamic data. Therefore, this research proposes the learning style identification by integrating stochastic and literate based driven approaches. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and the Naïve Bayes as the Stochastic Approach have been implemented. Subsequently, learner behavior as the literate based data is used to get hints during accessing the learning objects. The proposed model has been implemented to VARK learning style. The accuracy is calculated by comparing the model results with the questionnaire results. When Using the HMM, the proposed model gives accuracy in the range of 95% up to 96.67%. Additionally, when using the Naïve Bayes; the accuracy is 93.33%. The results give better accuracy compared to previous studies. In conclusion, the proposed model is promising for modeling learner style in personalized e-learning.","Learning style; Literate based driven; Personalized e-learning; Stochastic approach; VARK learning style",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The model is identified using system identification technique, in which the input-output data are collected by running a test car on an artificial road surface with two different speeds i.e., 10 km/h and 20 km/h. The quarter car passive suspension system dynamics is assumed to have an ARX model structure and identified using linear least-square estimation algorithm. The car vertical body acceleration, which is the output variable, is measured by installing an accelerometer sensor on the car body, above the suspension. On the other hand, the car shaft acceleration, which is the input variable, is measured by installing an accelerometer sensor at the lower arm of the car suspension. The best model for the 10 km/h car speed gives the output order (na) = 4, the input order (nb) = 2, delay (d) = 1, the best fit = 90.65%, and the Akaike's Final Prediction Error (FPE) = 5.315e-06.

Turbulence models examined in this study included: The standard k-ε, RNG k-ε, standard k-ω, SST k-ω (Shear Stress Transport) and the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM). For the sake of ease and simplicity, Eddy Dissipation combustion model (EDM) was used to calculate the temperature fields and species concentrations in the flame. Predictions generated by different turbulence models are then compared and validated against experimental measurements from a turbulent methane-air flame called flame A. Experimental measurements of flame A provides data on velocity, temperature and species concentrations. Results of the investigation showed that among five turbulence models tested, the standard k-ε model provides the predictions that are in closer agreement to the experimental data of flow-field, temperature, and species concentrations. In general, it can be deduced that apart from the standard k-ε model, other turbulence models are not capable of capturing the position and the value of peak temperature accurately. On the other hand, the standard k-ε turbulence model is able to accurately capture the position and compute the value of peak temperature in the flame. This is attributed due to a better prediction of the flow-field by the standard k-ε turbulence model than those of other turbulence models. These findings indicate that the standard k-ε turbulence model in combination with Eddy dissipation combustion model is capable of producing accurate predictions of flame flow-field and temperature.","Combustion; Non-premixed turbulent flame; Simulation; Turbulence model",,"Wusnah; Chemical Engineering Dept., Malikussaleh UniversityIndonesia",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Under-the-surface corrosion is more dangerous than other types as it is visually hidden. This research develops an imaging system to detect crevices resulting from subsurface corrosion. The system is built with a laser-generated acoustic (LGA) method, - using photoacoustic phenomena to generate acoustic waves from a laser and material interaction process, to construct a subsurface image of a metal. Though optical actuator is used, deeper penetration is achieved in the acoustic wave sensing, causing a change of intensity of the waves as they pass corrosion crevices. Measurement of the acoustic wave's intensity is used to construct LGA image illustrating the subsurface condition of an object. There are three main components of the device, which are a laser, a microphone and a data processor. The laser beam is modulated and exposed to an object to create thermal contraction. The microphone records acoustic waves generated in the process and the data processor analyses the result. Comprehensive measurement is done over the entire surface of the object to create 2-dimensional images. This research reports an experimental result of the imaging system on an object with subsurface corrosion crevices. LGA's images produced showed reasonably clear evolution process of the corrosion. In the experiment, the crevices emerge at 230μm depth were detected in the first 5 hours of the corrosion process. An advance analysis showed that the LGA images produced were able to show the evolution process of the shape of the crevices during corrosion. A mathematical model, based on acoustic transmission intensity equation, is designed to further examine the LGA image resulting in a curve which fits the measurement result with MAPE 12% difference.","Laser-generated acoustic; Photoacoustic imaging; Subsurface corrosion",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

After deposition, the material was heated at temperature 700°C for 1 hour using a vacuum furnace. Coated samples analysis was conducted by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) to examine coating layer morphology and its chemical composition, respectively. Experimental results showed that the voltage and time deposition gives different effects to surface coverage and thickness of hydroxyapatite layers. Optimum layer for dental roots is obtained from the voltage of 5 volts for 5 minutes with 100% surface coverage value and 45.55μm in thickness. With low voltage and short deposition time for making a uniform coating layer, this process is much cheaper than other processes, and it is predicted to be favorable for improving osseointegration of dental roots.","Dental roots; Electrophoretic deposition; Hydroxyapatite; Ti-6Al-4V",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Home agents are in charge for the registration of mobile devices and act as a key entity for the tunneling of data packets to the corresponding registered mobile nodes. A single home agent has administrative control over the critical tasks including home agent registration management, maintenance of cache data and tunneling of data packets to the mobile nodes that are away from their home networks and so on. However in this approach, home agent act as the sole failure point, which gave rise to the placement of multiple home agents to overcome this issue. The load balancing mechanism for multiple home agent deployment faces the problem of improper load sharing, signaling overhead and synchronization issues. Moreover, failure detection and recovery mechanism are inefficient in nature. It experiences a significant delay in tunneling of data packets and suffers from disconnection making it incompetent for the use in real time applications. Most of the existing methods for load sharing and failure detection use the concept of exchange of router advertisement message named as ""heart beat messages"" at a constant rate. The reduction in the interval of router advertisement can result in signaling overhead and synchronization issues. Hence, this paper investigates and analyzes the various load balancing mechanisms of mobile IPv6. In addition, it presents the comparative study of the failure detection and recovery mechanism of existing methods. Finally, it concludes that future work can be extended in the domain of distributed active load sharing mechanism and proactive failure detection.","Binding acknowledgement; Binding update; Distributed load balancing; IPv6 mobility; Route optimization",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Cellulose may occur in a crystalline form in addition to amorphous form. Cellulose and hemicelluloses can be converted into fermentable sugar, i.e. glucose and xylose, by chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis. This sugars is usually used as a feedstock for bioethanol production. Lignin and high-crystallinity of cellulose inhibit the performance of enzymatic hydrolysis process. Therefore pretreatment is necessary to remove lignin, decrease the crystallinity and improve the yield of enzymatic hydrolysis. One of the developed pre-treatment processes is soaking with aqueous ammonia solution or called by SAA process. In this study, the advantage of SAA pre-treatment process was investigated using ammonium solution prior to the enzymatic hydrolysis. The pre-treatments were carried out in various ammonium concentrations (5%, 7.5%, and 10%) at mild conditions (25 ° C and 1 atm) for 24 hrs, and with or without a following additional diluted-acid pre-treatment (92-98 °C and 1 atm for 1 hour).

The modified algorithm faced some problems, such as generating a distorted search space, which may have been caused by the method of randomization. This paper introduces an initialization technique that operates entirely in polar coordinates. Moreover, an investigation based on standard PSO was done to test the proposed technique.

In a project, different people are involved in the requirements engineering process, including requirement engineers, stakeholders, end users, and system designers. Amongst them, stakeholders play an essential role. Differences in goals and priorities of multiple stakeholders would make requirements management complex and difficult, which is a huge challenge for requirement engineers. From time to time, new requirements emerge, and existing requirements need changes to fulfil stakeholders' goals. Thus, such situation leads to high requirements volatility and low stability which causes overlapping and conflicting of requirements. The correctness and validity of requirements are of paramount importance as they are the key factors toward a successful system. A deep understanding of requirement management technique that conforms to users' needs is crucial. Such technique of the concept is applied to the Labour Management System.

Therefore, the objective function of an optimization problem would represent the total power losses of the distribution system, by considering only the active component of power losses while ignoring the reactive part. Constraints would be load flow, voltage drop, and the network configuration. In this paper, losses problem during the reconfiguration of a medium-voltage power distribution system have been minimized using a single-loop optimization method, whereas the load-flow analysis has been performed by utilizing the Newton-Raphson method. The optimization method was aimed to minimize the active-power losses of the system by formulating the problem as a matter of network reconfiguration. The solution scheme has been begun with a mesh distribution-network which had been obtained previously by assuming all the switches to be closed and then opened sequentially to eliminate loops. The optimization results showed that in a 21-bus distribution system there had been 10800 combinations, in which the lowest power losses occurred under the combination of NO 23, NO 21, NO 22, NO 24, NO 25, whereas the combination of NO 7, NO 10, NO 20, NO 15, NO 20, resulted in the power losses of 0.1676 per unit, being equal to 16.76 kVA at the base power of 100 kVA.","Losses minimization; Power distribution system; Single loop optimization",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

This research investigates the relationship between the reflected near infrared light and the internal quality of pineapples non-destructively. Five light emitted diodes (LEDs) that are in the range between 750 nm and 950 nm were used as the light source. The photodiode (OPT101) sensor was used to collect the light from the pineapple. The digital reflectometer was used to determine the reference SSC. The Near-infrared (NIR) data and the digital refractometer data were used to build the predictive model. The relationship between the near infrared light and the SSC of the pineapple was determined using artificial neural network predictive model. The internal quality of pineapples was determined using five NIR data wavelengths, the result points out that the k-fold cross-validation accurate classification was 75.56%. Besides, findings indicate that the artificial neural network that used four wavelengths that were 780 nm, 850 nm, 870 nm, and 940 nm achieved better classification than that used five wavelengths that included 910 nm.

This study analyzes the news coverage of events related to the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami in German, American and Japanese newspapers. It will aim to uncover expressional differences in the coverage on a similar topic reported in different languages. This research especially focuses on the use of religious language in the coverage, which in this paper refers to religious metaphors and symbols originating from a Christian context. Previous research shows that the use of religious language in the media, affects consumers mentally and emotionally. Based on that theory, this study compares how religious language is used in the coverage and tries to clarify the functions of religious expressions through a critical discourse analysis. The results show that religious language appears continuously in German and American news reports related to the disaster. Religious language is mostly used symbolically as well as metaphorically in order to illustrate the destruction caused by the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster, while at the same time conveying emotions such as the fear of the victims. It is also used to describe the difficulties, suffering and hope of the people in the disaster-hit area. Moreover religious language provokes emotions in the readers and makes it easier for them to understand the situation in Japan as well as the feelings of the disaster refugees. A difference between the German and American news coverage was seen in the description of the situation at the nuclear power plant and the state of the victims in Fukushima and the Tohoku region. In Germany, religious language can change the viewpoint of and provoke emotions in the readers. It is also employed to emphasize domestic social and political problems related to German energy policy.","3.11 news reports; German and American news coverage; Language and media; Religious language",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

In this study, tomatoes from local cultivar were grown in a net house, in west Sumatra. The growth medium comprised of soil, husk, and manures with the composition of 1: 1: 1 respectively. For best growth, plants were watered regularly, and protect from pests and weeds. The observations were performed on 21st, 42nd, and 63rd day after sowing (DAS). The samples were the leaflets of the primary compound leaves of the plants. The leaflets were cut and digitized using a high-resolution colour scanner. The imaging performed at 300 dpi resolution, and the recorded image subsequently processed by the image processing software. Image segmentation performed to remove background from the object. Furthermore, the greenish of leaf object in the image were measured in RGB colour space. The leaf dimensions and area were quantified by the software, as well as the length of the leaflet main vein at central axis. Two secondary leaflet's blades were selected manually, and the angle formed between the blades and the main vein was measured. A Statistical engineering program was used to identify the principal morphology characteristics of the leaf, by means of Principal component analysis (PCA). Mathematical models were developed based on the principal component values and leaflets position to determine the plants age and state. Results showed all model have coefficient of correlation higher than 0.99 indicating acceptable accuracy.","Age states of plants; Digitizing; Morphology; Non-destructive; Tomato leaf",,"Makky, M.; Department of Agricultural Engineering, FATETA, Andalas UniversityIndonesia; email: muh_makky@yahoo.com",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The maximum level (ML) of sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate in processed meat products imposed by Ministry of Public Health is 1000 ppm. Although there are warnings about overusing of these preservatives that related to human health, many manufacturers do not follow the regulations. The aim of this study was to survey and consider the amounts and presence of these preservatives in processed meat products by using High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. 90 samples of brands and no brands including Vietnamese pork rolls, pâtés, hams, sausages, and fermented pork rolls that available at markets in Ho Chi Minh City were analysed for these two preservatives. There was a preference for using sodium benzoate in all samples. Moreover, Vietnamese pork roll samples had the highest percentage of samples with preservatives concentrations exceeding the ML. Among 90 samples, sodium benzoate was detected in 52.2% of samples and 17.8% of them exceeded the ML, while potassium sorbate was found in 24.4% of samples and only 2.2% of them exceeded the regulated amount. 46.4% of Vietnamese pork rolls, 12.5% of pâtés, and 9.1% of fermented pork rolls had sodium benzoate exceeded the ML, whilst ham and sausage samples contained the concentrations inside the safety limits. Furthermore, only one sample of Vietnamese pork rolls and one sample of sausages had potassium sorbate concentrations surpassing the ML with the level of 1,717.57 mg/kg and 1,814.00 mg/kg, respectively. Furthermore, branded samples showed a significantly different result in compared with no branded samples. Of branded samples, exceeding sodium benzoate level ML was detected in 10% of samples and none of the samples found surpassing potassium sorbate limit amount. Nevertheless, 27.5% and 5% of unbranded samples had sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate higher than the authorized amounts, respectively.

They contribute to the improvement of public services delivery and the welfare of society. But some current governance issues in Indonesia, such as corruption, accountability and performance problems, raise questions concerning the effectiveness of Indonesia's GIA units. The complexity of these issues requires cybernetic study to find holistic and effective solutions. The objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of government internal audit systems in order to enhance the professionalism of government internal auditors and the maturity of the management processes that they audit. This research was based on qualitative approaches with systems methodology. The instruments used during the research were regulatory analysis, survey, and in-depth interviews. The survey involved 205 Chief Audit Executives (CAE) of Government Internal Supervisory Apparatus (GISA) in national government and regional governments, and was conducted on-line or on paper. The survey was complemented by in-depth interview with 24 (twenty four) senior stakeholders representing practitioners (the CAE of GISA units), internal users (governors, mayors, heads of regional planning agencies), external users (Indonesia's Supreme Audit Board, SAB), regulators, and associations of professional internal auditors, both private sector (IIA) and public sector (AAIPI). The research found that the effort of enhancing the role of the GIA units should be seen holistically. The improvement of the role of GIA units related to the stakeholders, including management line of the organization, the SAB, professional associations, regulators, and law enforcement officials as well as other factors. The arrangement of the internal audit system could allow the government auditors to improve their professionalism and help line management to mature their management processes. The emerging strategic issues needed to build an effective internal audit system are the improvement of independence and objectivity of the auditors, a relationship with relevant stakeholders regulation and harmonization of regulation for the internal audit system.","Auditor professionalism; Government internal audit; Maturity of management level; Regulation; System analysis",,"Santosa, M.H.; Graduate Program of Management and Business, Bogor Agricultural UniversityIndonesia; email: m4hesa@yahoo.com",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

It is even more important if the optimization problems are limited by time constraints. In a limited time constraint problems, it is crucial for any algorithms to get the best results or near-optimum results. In a previous study, Differential Evolution (DE) has been found as one of the best performing algorithms under time constraints. As this has help in answering which algorithm that yields results that are near-optimum under a limited time constraint. Hence to further enhance the performance of DE under time constraint evaluation, a throughout parameter searching for population size, mutation constant and f constant have been carried out. CEC 2015 Global Optimization Competition's 15 scalable test problems are used as test suite for this study. In the previous study the same test suits has been used and the results from DE will be use as the benchmark for this study since it shows the best results among the previous tested algorithms. Eight different populations size are used and they are 10, 30, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, and 500. Each of these populations size will run with mutation constant of 0.1 until 0.9 and from 0.1 until 0.9. It was found that population size 100, Cr = 0.9, F=0.5 outperform the benchmark results. It is also observed from the results that good higher Cr around 0.8 and 0.9 with low F around 0.3 to 0.4 yields good results for DE under time constraints evaluation.","DE; Evolutionary optimization; Expensive optimization problems; Parameter searching; Time-limited optimization",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

At this moment, the satellite needs to reduce the tumbling rate so that the satellite can enter a stable and unruffled state. The satellite also must maintain a certain attitude while orbiting in order to allow precise pointing of the antenna toward the earth. In this study, a hardware-in-loopsimulator was devised for the purpose of improving the design and verifying attitude control concepts for Innovative Satellite (InnoSAT) system. A new software architecture and algorithm was developed based on the controller, InnoSAT plant, actuator and sensor. Firstly, the controller, actuator and sensor was modelled in the MATLAB program together with InnoSAT plant. The actuator and sensor were assumed to be ideal. However, some properties of the actuator and sensor were simulated in the software simulator. If the software simulation performed satisfactorily, the control algorithm will be embedded into Rabbit Micro Controller (RCM4100) using Dynamic C language. This is the part where the hardware simulation is developed which is creating hardware-inloop- simulation technique for verification of InnoSAT Attitude Control System (ACS) performance. The satellite simulator was tested using simulated data in order to observe the performances of the controller in real time simulation. The results show that the InnoSAT ACS simulator can produce as good result as a MATLAB simulation for the InnoSAT plants. From the results, it is adequate to verify that the developed protocol working satisfyingly and seems to be possible to be implemented on the actual flight.","Attitude control system; Hardware-in-loop-simulation; Innovative satellite; Rabbit micro controller",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

In doing so, many kinds of baits are used to attract and trap these flies either by mechanical or chemical means. But all these baits are not capable of attracting flies equally. The main goal of this study is to find out the best bait that can attract house fly effectively and safely in everyplace. Experiments were conducted to find out the best bait among six different baits commonly used in Malaysia. Two baits made in abroad and four baits made in Malaysia were selected for conducting this study because these baits are commonly used in Malaysia. Experiments were carried out in food industry, fish market and poultry farm in the east coast of Malaysia. Data were collected from the field experiments continuously for six days and analysed to determine the best bait that trap the house flies very effectively. Data analysis results show that the Chinese Electronic Fly Catcher Trap (CEFCT bait is the best one for trapping house flies effectively compared to other baits.

AM in particular Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) used (ABS) thermoplastic have shown the most popular among the industry as its technology can print complex geometrical part without human intervention and tools. However, FDM fierce enemy whereas the common problem of stair-stepping, which means that seam lines appear between layers and excess material if often left as a residue, cause to lead rough surface and poor quality finish. It is often desirable for an AM model to have aesthetic or functional importance. Hence, reducing layer thickness will generally improve surface roughness but will add to the build time for the model. As an interest investigates the use of ultrasonic for FDM, this experiment will focus on the effect of applying multiple piezoelectric transducer for FDM printer. This paper aims to explore the effect use of multiple piezoelectric with different frequency applied (27, 40, 50 kHz) to improve surface finish quality part printed by FDM whereby an ultrasonic transducer firmly attached onto the platform. Optical microscope with the aid of pro VIS software version 2.90 was used to measure the quality of surface roughness of samples printed with vibration in the above stated frequency. Hence, it was found that 1 piezo with 50 kHz frequency applied to the FDM machine achieved improve surface finish due to less layer thickness defect and finer layer thickness produce.","Additive manufacturing; Fused deposition modelling; Surface finish; Ultrasonic frequency",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

A diary study was conducted through WeChat and phone interviews to understand how consumers conduct their everyday financial transactions. The research illustrated the need to adapt approaches to diary participants, such as utilising a chat agent or avatar to elicit richer data and demonstrated the utility of a feedback loop, which reassured and reminded participants to post regularly, in turn encouraging posts with more depth. The relationships built over the course of the diary study were also imperative to the success of follow-up semi-structured phone interviews, as trust and familiarity between researchers and participants enabled more intimate conversations. Novel use of the application worked well in gaining a deeper appreciation of the experiences of selected consumers.

A selected model of PV panel firstly was simulated using PVsyst software in order to evaluate its output performance. Meanwhile, PROVA 200 used to measure and record all electrical data for outdoor experimental during the sunniest day. Besides, the thermal distribution was analysed through PV panel temperatures and thermal imaging. Simulation results implied that the output power of PV panel decreases with increasing of its working temperature followed by the efficiency. The experimental results obviously show that the standard test condition (STC) parameters do not represent the real operating conditions of PV panel for outdoor conditions. Less output power was produced affected by the atmospheric factors such as solar irradiance and ambient temperature. These both factors strongly affected the PV panel temperature distribution.

In this preliminary paper, we explore the feasibility of SOM in classifying white-copy paper for forensic purposes. A total of 150 infrared spectra were collected from three varieties of white paper using Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. Each IR spectrum composed of over thousands of wavenumbers (i.e. input variables) and resembles chemical fingerprint for the sample. Comparative performance between raw wavenumbers and its reduced form (i.e. principal components, PCs) in SOM modeling also conducted. Results showed that SOM built with PCs is much efficient than built with raw wavenumbers, with classification accuracy of over 90% is obtained with external validation test. This study shows that SOM coupled with ATR-FTIR spectroscopy could be a potential non-destructive approach for forensic paper analysis.","Classification; Forensic paper analysis; IR spectrum; Self-organizing map",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Due to the polymorphic and stealth nature of malware attacks, a signature-based analysis that is done statically is no longer sufficient to solve such a problem. Therefore, a behavioral or anomalous analysis will provide a more dynamic approach for the solution. However, recent studies have shown that current behavioral methods at the network-level have several issues such as the inability to predict zero-day attacks, high-level assumptions, non-inferential analysis and performance issues. Other than performance issues, this study has identified common scientific characteristics which are reduced parameter, θ and lack of priori information p(θ) that causes the problems. Previous methods were proposed to address the problem, however, were still unable to resolve the stated scientific hitches. Due to the shortcomings, the Bayesian Network in terms of its probabilistic modeling would be the best method to deal with the stated scientific glitches which also have been proven in the area of Clinical Expert Systems, Artificial Intelligence, and Pattern Recognition. This study will critically review the predictive analytic applications of Bayesian Network model in different research domain such as Clinical Expert Systems, Artificial Intelligence, and Pattern Recognition and discover any potential approach available in the domain of Computer Networks.

A survey to collecting data on common devices used in household has been done, i.e. information about price and energy consumption of the devices. There are two ways to doing this energy efficiency: changing the energy intensive equipment to more energy-efficient equipment, and changing the consumer behaviour. Household will only attract to apply energy efficiency scenarios on several conditions: low initial investment, short payback period of that investment, and high total energy and cost savings. We can applying several energy efficiency scenarios, and simulate the saving of the government (spending fewer subsidies) and also the saving from household (spending less energy loss, and payback period). The analysis demonstrated that replacing old appliances with newer technology would decrease energy consumption, but also increase the household spending for investment on new appliances. We also simulated further payback period with and without subsidy. The use of accurate energy performance measurement standards and protocols is the base of effective implementation of energy efficiency policies for appliances and equipment.

Therefore, it is extremely difficult to achieve user requirements at one single time. Agile methods have been introduced to mitigate such issues by implementing user requirements incrementally and iteratively. The top significant aspect in agile development is selecting a group of prominent requirements to be implemented in iteration. This could be derived from continuous requirements prioritisation (RP). To assign which requirements should be selected by practitioners is considered one of the obstacles faced in the process of implementing the inter-iteration period. This study aimed to identify the RP elements and factors that should be considered through the RP process in agile software development. The elements and factors were identified through a review of previous studies and in-depth interviews involving 18 agile practitioners from different software development organizations in different countries (i.e., Malaysia and Jordan), over a period of 2 years. To get the best result, the data is analyzed by using grounded theory techniques (Open, Axial and Selective coding).

It improves soil physical, chemical and biological properties. Assimilated plant C which is allocated to the mycorrhizal fungus, appears as a recalcitrant glycoprotein (glomalin) in cell walls of hyphae and spores. Considering global warming due to increasing greenhouse gases, this phenomenon could be important in carbon sequestration and reducing CO2 in atmosphere. Chemical fertilizers could affect symbiotic relations of these fungi, which in turn affect glomalin production. In a pot culture experiment, the sterile soil was treated with 0, 100, 200 mg N kg-1 soil as urea or 0, 20, 40 mg P kg-1 soil as triple superphosphate, in two separate factorial experiment based on completely randomized design with three replications. Corn plant (Zea mays L.) was inoculated with Rhizophagus clarus (formerly, Glomus clarum) or Rhizophagus intraradices (formerly, Glomus intraradices) in each set of experiment. Easley extractable glomalin (EEG) and total glomalin (TG) in soil were determined by Bradford method at the end of experiment. Root colonization by both fungi increased EEG and TG compared to the non-mycorrhizal control (p&lt;0.05). Nitrogen levels of 100, 200 increased EEG by 75 and 112% and TG by 59 and 76%, respectively, compared to the no nitrogen treatment. P levels of 20, 40 caused 27% increase and 6% decrease in EEG, and 24% increase and 13% decrease in TG, respectively, compared to the zero addition of phosphorus. Regarding glomalin production in this condition, R. clarus was more efficient than R. intraradices. Application of 20 mg P kg-1 increased root colonization, dry weights of shoot and root, chlorophyll index, leaf area, amount of shoot and root nitrogen and potassium compared to the 40 mgP. kg-1 and control.

Currently it was also reported attacking groundnut in some parts of Sumatera causing serious yield loss. Insecticide treatment is not only ecologically unsafe, but also is not practical due to concealed behavior of the larvae within pods below soil surface. Systemic insecticide might be so but unsafe as it might leave unaccepted residue in harvested pods. It is clear that safer more effective technology such as biological control is badly needed. A Field study was conducted at the University of Bengkulu Research Station in 2012-2013. The objectives was to determine the effectiveness of non local strain of entomopathoegen nematode (EPN), Sterinenema carpocapsae, to control LBPB attacking groundnut. Groundnut seeds were sewed in plots which were later treated with S. carpocasae produce by Biological Control Laboratory University of Jember at the dose of 500.000 JI m-2. EPN was sprayed upon plants and soil surface twice at plant age of 45 and 65 days after sewing (DAS). There were insecticide treatment and control plots as comparison. Observations of damaged pods and the presence of LBPB larvae were done at plant age of 63, 77, 90 DAS and at the haevesting date. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and the means of damaged pods were separated with least significant different (LSD). The result revealed that in two years study, damaged pods consistently tended to be less in plots treated with S. carpocasae or insecticide than those in controls, indicating that it might be effective against PLPB. The lack of significant different between EPN treated and control plots might be as a result of low percentages of EPN larval survival due shipment problem (i.e. inappropriate packaging and long transportation that toke several days) or it might be that the strain was less adapted yet to local conditions. I speculate that local strain of EPN might be more effective to control LBPB attacking groundnut.","Entomopathogen; Groundnut; Pod borer",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int. J. Adv. Sci.

Despite several techniques proposed to recognize and locate duplication of database records, there is a dearth of studies available which rate the effectiveness of the diverse techniques used for duplicate record detection. The calculating time complexity of the proposed methods reveals their performance rating. The time complexity calculation showed that the efficiency of these methods improved when blocking and windowing are applied. Some domain-specific methods train systems to optimize results and improve efficiency and scalability, but they are prone to errors. Most of the existing methods fail to either discuss or lack thoroughness in consideration of scalability. The process of sorting and searching form an essential part of duplication detection, but they are time-consuming. Therefore this paper proposes the possibility of eliminating the sorting process by utilization of tree structure to improve the record duplication detection. This has added benefits of reducing the time required and offers a probable increase in scalability. For a database system, scalability is an inherent feature of any proposed solution, due to the fact that the data size is huge. Improving the efficiency in identifying duplicate records in databases is an essential step for data cleaning and data integration methods. This paper reveals that the current proposed methods lack in providing solutions that are scalable, high accurate, and reduce the processing time during detecting duplication of records in the database.

Before this technology is applied, the first step is test the system to measure the reliability of system. The reliability of system can be measured using accuracy to recognize the speaker such as speaker identity or gender. This paper introduces the stochastic model based on mel-frequencies to identify the gender of speaker in a noisy environment. The Euclidean minimum distance and back propagation neural networks were used to create a model to recognize the gender from his/her speech signal based on formant and pitch of Mel-frequencies. The system uses threshold technique as identification tool. By using this threshold value, the proposed method can identifies the gender of speaker up to 94.11% and the average of processing duration is 15.47 msec.

In SML techniques, the features play an essential role in terms of improving the effectiveness of the recognition process. Features can be identified as a set of discriminating and distinguishing characteristics that have the ability to indicate the occurrence of an entity. In this manner, the features should be able to generalize which means to discriminate the entities correctly even on new and unseen samples. Several studies have tackled the role of features in terms of identifying named entities. However, with the surge of biomedical researches, there is a vital demand to explore biomedical features.

E-records are crucial in complementing business functions, an essential tool to assess organizational performance and are the core of good governance. Erecords in Higher Professional Education (HPE) institutions contain valuable information in running the education business in an efficient and effective manner, supplying services consistently and in supporting effective performance evaluation and decisions. There are serious consequences and risk awaiting when the administrators of HPE are not based on information contained in erecords in making decisions. Well-informed decision makings would thus be impossible if electronic records are not efficiently and effectively managed the using system. Therefore, Electronic Records Management System (ERMS) is an effective and efficient tool to hinder such a problem. Voluminous electronic records are created every day in HPE. The record keepers inclusive of records managers, archivists, administrators and IT personnel, who are the people essentially involved in creating, maintaining and preserving the contents of the e-records. Thus, this personnel participating in the records keeping should identify the readiness of the HPE institutions to adopt ERMS. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate the readiness of the Yemeni HPE institutions to adopt the ERMS. The study involves interviewing 20 specialists from Yemeni HPE institutions who are involved in ERMS. The findings showed that in order to promote effective ERMS readiness in the HPE institutions, there should be a framework to be used as guidance in such process.","Electronic records management system; ERMS adoption; Higher professional education; Policy; Yemen",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

However, larger organizations aim at incorporating more Agile methods owing to the fact that its application is prevalently tailored for small teams. The scope in which large firms are interested will extend the original Agile methods to include larger teams, coordination, communication among teams and customers as well as oversight. Determining particular software method is always challenging for software companies especially when considering start-up, small to medium or large enterprises. Most of large organizations develop large-scale projects by teams of teams or teams of teams of teams. Therefore, most recognized Agile methods or first-generation methods such as XP and SCRUM need to be modified before they are employed in large organizations; which is not an easy task. Accomplishing said task would necessitate large organizations to pick and select from the scaling Agile methods in accommodating a single vision for large and multiple teams. Deciding the right choice requires wholesome understanding of the method including its strengths and weaknesses as well as when and how it makes sense.

This paper illustrates the SNR enhancement & bandwidth optimization technique in security purpose using PCM- DSSS sample by sample encryption scheme. For this purpose, after sampling of a signal, simple mathematical operation is performed in each sample with a time varying arbitrary weights. This arbitrary weight can be obtained from D/A conversion of pseudo noise sequence. Since the bandwidth consumption in security purpose can be minimized in this scheme, a significant portion of unused bandwidth can be used to improve the SNR of the system by reducing quantization noise of encrypted samples. By the same token, the possibility of SNR improvement is demonstrated by reckoning the quantization noise while introducing additional quantization step.","Bandwidth; Encryption; SNR; SQR",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The objective of this work was to determine the total CoP of the thermoelectric module when it was operated in a combination of heating and cooling modes. The total CoP was inferred by fitting the temperature of cold and hot water streams which were obtained from experiments to a mathematical model of the thermoelectric heating and cooling system. The highest temperature difference between hot and cold streams was 40 Kelvin. The worst root-mean-square error between the measured and calculated temperature was 2 Kelvin, except for the hot stream temperature curve in the Condition 1(RMS error was 3.5 Kelvin). It was proved that the total CoP of 4.5 was achievable for thermoelectric module operated in the combined heating and cooling modes. However, the total CoP decreased as the temperature difference between hot and cold streams was increased.

Rapid tool wear, excessive heat generation, dimensional instability and loss of surface integrity are the issues that plague the conventional machining of Ti6Al4V. In view of these facts, non-traditional machining processes like electron discharge machining (EDM) - die sinking and wire cut prove to be a substitute for the conventional machining. In this study, an experimental optimization of EDM die-sinking electrode materials among copper, brass and graphite, is carried out. Experimental design is created using a statistical tool and actual machining is carried out to record the surface roughness, variations on the surface hardness and dimensional stability. Quality evaluation and statistical analysis substantiates graphite electrodes to produce better surface finish-Ra 2.05microns with minimal dimensional variation-less than 10%-when operated at minimum spark gaps. It is inferred that graphite electrodes exhibit higher resistivity towards current than its counterparts thus passing minimum spark energy preventing excessive self-wear and a dimensionally accurate work piece. The depth of machining highly impacts the variations on the surface hardness post machining.","Dimensional differential; EDM die-sinking; Spark gap; Surface roughness; Ti6Al4V",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

However, the number of studies that address the interaction of multi-touch gestures among kindergarten children are still limited. In fact, such interactions foster great learning potential in developmental skills for children. This paper specifically focuses on the priority of children's interaction abilities towards multi-touch gestures such as rotation, zoom-in, and zoom-out. This study had involved ten kindergarten children in a kindergarten located in Kajang, Selangor between ages of four to six years old. A direct observation technique was used in this study. The findings show three items from the aspects of motor and cognitive skills (such as touch input unable to reach screen sensitivity, unintentional touches, and fingers touching the object inaccurately) are the interaction ability that should be prioritized.

Breadfruit, bengkuang (jicama), and rice starches were extracted from local sources in Banda Aceh - Indonesia. Two variables studied were type of starches and the amount of oil added into emulsion (15 and 25%). Proximate analysis showed that the starch content of breadfruit, jicama and rice were 77.57, 67.41, and 80.51% respectively and the amylose content were 20.50, 16.5, and 13.6%. Results showed that the emulsification index (EI) of emulsion prepared with jicama and rice starches were lower than the EI of emulsion stabilized by breadfruit starch. However, the viscosity of breadfruit emulsion was higher than the other two emulsions. Storage stability test in room temperature also demonstrated that oil in water emulsion made from breadfruit starch had the lowest separation rate over storage period compared to jicama and rice emulsions. Overall, stabilization of 25% oil in breadfruit emulsion was slightly better than addition of 15% oil where the visible boundaries or serum layer of the emulsion was in the range of 5-6 ml at the end of storage test. Breadfruit starch was further modified by reacting it with octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) to produce OSA-modified breadfruit starch. The degree of substitution (DS) of OSA modified breadfruit starch was 0.0231. OSA-modified breadfruit starch is highly potential to be used as food emulsifier and therefore studied further to examine its ability to stabilize oil in water emulsion.","Breadfruit starch; Emulsion stability; Jicama starch; OSA-modified starch; Rice starch",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

For this purpose, the nanofibers were deposited on a substrate with patterned electrodes. The distance between two electrodes is 2 mm. The sheet resistance of the PVA nanofibers was measured by using two-point probe connected to a source measurement unit of Keithley SMU-2400. As a result, the conductivity of PVA electrospun nanofibers increases from 0.03 μS/cm to 1.20 μS/cm by increasing the PVA concentration from 8 to 10 wt%. More significant improvement is also achieved by mixing PVA and PEDOT:PSS to be 110 μS/cm after being exposure DMSO. This improvement has been confirmed using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, where a solvent-induced fusion occurs at the nanofiber junction points after DMSO treatment.

Excessive and deficiencies of P in calcareous soils has been reported. Several methods can be used to recognize soil bioavailable phosphorus. Soil P tests involve chemical extraction and ion-sink extractants. The diffusive gradient in thin-films (DGT) is a new technique for measuring available soil phosphorus. This technique attempts to simulate physico-chemical processes influencing the uptake of solutes by plant roots. Also, the dialysis membrane tubes filled with hydrous ferric oxide solution (DMT-HFO) has recently been used to assess P desorption over long-term laboratory studies. The DMT-HFO method acts like the DGT method. Both systems are based on Fick's law and try to imitate physicochemical uptake of P by plant roots in soils. The aim of this research was to use Fick's law in the interpretation of DMT measurements and compare it with the Olsen and DGT methods for assessment of corn available phosphorus in some calcareous soils. For this purpose, the diffusion coefficients of P in the DMT membrane and DGT gel were calculated. The DMT-HFOs were located in soil suspensions at 24, 72, 240, and 500 hours and the concentration of DMT-HFO (CDMT-HFO) for P in the mentioned times were compared with those of Olsen and DGT methods on assessing of corn P uptake. Corn (SC 704) were grown in a greenhouse on ten different calcareous soils. Based on the results, the diffusion coefficient of P (H2PO4-) in DMT (5.54*10-8 cm2.s-1) was lower than that of DGT gel (5.8*10-6 cm2.s-1). The linear correlation coefficient(r) between CDMT-HFO and corn P content was increased by the time (24-500 hours). Based on the r2 values, the lowest and highest correlations were related to CDMT-HFO in 24 hours (r2=0.22, p&lt;0.05) and 500 hours (r2=0.9, p&lt;0.05), respectively. The DMT-HFO provides a more precise correlation with P uptake by corn (r2=0.9 in 500 hours) than Olsen P (r2=0.86) and CE (DGT) (r2=0.76). In roots, the best correlation between CDMT-HFO and corn P uptake was obtained in 250 hours.

Factors affect food production includes climate variability and climate change. To adapt the impact of climate change, Indonesia Agricultural Research and Development has designed a Crop Calendar-Information System. This technology contains recommendation on planting time, cropping patterns, and adaptive technology with Integrated-web-based according to climate prediction and season-to-date. Although it has been launched officially since 2011, the uses as consider for farming in sub-districts are remain low. This paper aims to present the process of designing the CCIS, the dissemination activities, and process of getting feedback to improve the CCIS implementation. Survey was done using a mail survey in 33 provinces for a year during January-December 2014. The data was collected three times for a year covered 32 provinces. The data collected consist of primary and secondary data. Observations were carried out to determine the role of CCIS provider. Methods of data analysis use descriptive qualitative method through tabulation, data summary, data reduction, data display, then conclusion and verification. Result shows that on average, there was 10 socialization held in 10 sub-districts with 200 extension officers attend the session. The most common dissemination methods use printed media and direct communication (70-88%) and the least use visual communication-radio/television (12%) and field demonstration (6%). Furthermore, feedback of the CCIS dissemination shows that hardly any sites implement the CCIS recommendation because of unavailability of recommended variety and water availability (43,25%), whereas 52,75% said that the recommendation was less suitable with their condition and less frequency in doing socialization. According to the validation activities done in 16 provinces, the suitability of planting time vary compared to the actual planting time. In rainy season (MH), 37.5% of the sample district had the accurate prediction range from 64% up to 90%. Although the technology is widely spread, it still needed effort to ensure farmers and local stakeholders to use the CCIS as a recommendation technology to minimize the impact of the climate change.","Crop calendar information systems; Dissemination; Feedback",,"Yulianti, A.; Indonesian Center for Agricultural Technology Assessement and Development IndonesiaIndonesia; email: astr1na@yahoo.com",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

In a colour image retrieval application, images retrieved by users are accomplished according to their specifications on what they want or acquire, which could be based upon so many concepts. We suggest an approach to categorize the colour appearances of whole scene landscape painting images based on human colour perception. The colour features in the image are represented using a colour histogram. We then find the suitable quantization bins that can be used to generate optimum colour histograms for all categories of colour appearances, which is selected based on the Harmonic Mean of the precision and recall, also known as F-Score percentage higher saturated value. Colour appearance attributes in the CIELab colour model (L-Lightness, a and b are colour-opponent dimension) are used to generate colour appearance feature vectors namely the saturation metric, lightness metric and multicoloured metric. For the categorizations, we use the Nearest Neighbour (NN) method to detect the classes by using the predefined colour appearance descriptor measures and the pre-set thresholds. The experimental results show that the quantization of CIELab colour model into 11 uniformly bins for each component had achieved the optimum result for all colour appearances categories.","CIELab colour model; Colour appearance feature vector; Colour concept; Image classification",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Meanwhile, hydrological data are critical for performing a range of purposes, including water resources assessment, impacts of climate change and flood forecasting and warning. It can be said that the prevention of disasters caused by floods and droughts would be impossible without rational forecasting technology based on an understanding of the rainfall-runoff phenomenon and statistical analysis of past hydrological data, which cannot be achieved without meteo-hydrological observations. The lack of adequate meteo-hydrological data affects the ability to model, predict and plan for catastrophic events such as floods and droughts which have obvious negative impacts on public health and socio-economic aspects. The accurate estimation of the spatial distribution of meteorological and hydrological parameters requires a dense network of instruments, which entails large installation and operational costs. It is thus necessary to optimize the number and location of meteohydrological stations. This paper presents a GIS-based approach to establishing an optimal meteo-hydrological station network on Vu Gia-Thu Bon river basin for developing an up-to-date real time flood warning system. Based on statistical analysis of the annual rainfall total data at 9 existing gauges in the study area from 1980 to 2013, it showed that the error of the existing network was about 7.47%. Considering 9 rain gauges as a standard representative of rainfall over the region, if the error decreases from 7.47% to 5%, the number of additional rain gauges should be 20. For adequate and economical network design, these additional rain gauges were spatially distributed between the different isohyetals after considering the relative distances between rain gauges, their accessibility, personnel required for making observations using multi-layers analysis and spatial interpolation. For hydrological stations, based on consideration existing network with the requirements set out by the flood warning system, the number of stations should be five. In terms of spatial distribution, three stations were distributed across two main tributaries of Vu Gia-Thu Bon river basin, behind the dams for water discharge calibration and the others were located on downstream for water stage calibration. The results of the study provided a scientific approach can be applied to optimizing the meteo-hydrological station network over the river basin.","GIS; Meteo-hydrological; Meteorological; River basin",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The model's construction involves structure selection and parameter estimation, which can be simultaneously performed using the established Orthogonal Least Squares (OLS) algorithm. However, several criticisms have been directed towards OLS for its tendency to select excessive or sub-optimal terms leading to nonparsimonious models. This paper proposes the application of the Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) algorithm for structure selection of NARMAX models. The selection process searches for the optimal structure using binary bits to accept or reject the terms to form the reduced regressor matrix. Construction of the model is done by first estimating the NARX model, then continues with the estimation of the MA model based on the residuals produced by NARX. One Step Ahead (OSA) prediction, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and residual histogram analysis were performed to validate the model. The proposed optimization algorithm was tested on the Flexible Robot Arm (FRA) dataset. Results show the success of BPSO structure selection for NARMAX when applied to the FRA dataset. The final NARMAX model combines the NARX and MA models to produce a model with improved predictive ability compared to the NARX model.","NARMAX; Particle swarm optimization; Structure selection; system identification",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The government sector faces various problems in providing IT services due to constraints or lack of knowledge, skills, and expertise, human resource and technology. Thus, IT services need to be outsourced to overcome these problems. While the need for outsourcing has increased, reported weaknesses of the outsourcing activities are attributed to issues such as project rationale and the unclear role of the project team, lack of involvement of subject matter experts and users in the early stages, lack of control and lack of emphasis on quality. These issues indicate the low readiness level of the client's organization to take up outsourcing activities. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the contributing readiness factors that clients should comply with in order to ensure the success of outsourcing software projects. Systematic reviews and content analysis were employed in order to propose a conceptual model. There are 27 factors identified and classified into 9 dimensions. There are six internal dimensions were identified as contributing to the client's readiness such as strategy, people, organization culture, process, technology, and management whilst three other external dimensions include the government, market, and people. The outcome of this study is a software outsourcing readiness model that will assist software practitioners in designing effective outsourcing software project strategies. The model is important since the agencies have difficulty in addressing their readiness level as part of the implementation plan and to avoid project failure.","Client's readiness; Organization readiness; Outsourcing; Software development",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Two novel features - beyond the state of the art of currently available systems - are added: the use of natural language and the ability to react in real-time to changes in parking occupancy. If the number of parking lots drops to a critical level, the application redirects the driver to another parking place. Furthermore, the app includes GPS and Google maps interfacing modules which enable the application to detect the driver location and calculate the nearest car park distance.

The nutrient stream can be used safely for food production through ecological engineering interventions (introduction of green algae in urban wetlands). Effects of wastewater on growth yield and microbial contamination on hydroponic tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) was studied in pilot scale wetland for 6 month under the presence of green algae (Euglena sp.) with different chlorophyll a concentration. Domestic wastewater (BOD 205 mg.L-1, TN 29 mg.L-1 and TP 8 mg.L-1) with loading rate of 0.9 L.m-2.d-1 was used for each wetland. The wastewater did not affect fruit pH, increased their size up to 1.7 ï¿½ 0.31 cm in diameter, and weight up to 69.3 ï¿½ 6.0 g. Microbial contamination (Total coliforms (TC) and Fecal coliforms (FC)) on fruit surface significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05) with the increasing algal concentration up to 240 μg.L-1.

The aims of this research were to find the best sterilization technique of P. hookeriana explant and to induce maximum formation of embryogenic calli. Rapid multiplication of this orchid was achieved through culture of shoot tips and young leaf segments of mature plants by in vitro cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium enriched with 50 g L-1 banana pulp. The experiment used Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with three replications. In the first stage, the explants were sterilized using three compositions of sterilizaton material. In the second stage, the explants were planted on the MS basal medium with addition of five levels of 2,4-Diclhorophenoxy Acetis Acid concentrations, namely 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00 mg L-1. The result showed that the best sterilization method to reduce explant contaminant was method 3, in which the explant was washed with detergent, rinsed with flowing water, soaked in 0.1% (v/v) HgCl2 solution for 30 minutes, soaked again in the 10% (v/v) Sodium hypochloride solution for 20 minutes, rinsed three times with sterile water before planted and then soaked in sterile water added 10% (v/v) betadhine before planted on treated medium.

The process of knowing users' opinions toward particular product or services whether positive or negative is called sentiment analysis. Arabic is one of the common languages that have been addressed regarding sentiment analysis. In the literature, several approaches have been proposed for Arabic sentiment analysis and most of these approaches are using machine learning techniques. Machine learning techniques are various and have different performances. Therefore, in this study, we try to identify a simple, but workable approach for Arabic sentiment analysis on Twitter. Hence, this study aims to investigate the machine learning technique in terms of Arabic sentiment analysis on Twitter. Three techniques have been used including Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree (DT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). In addition, two simple sub-tasks pre-processing have been also used; Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Arabic stemming to get the heaviest weight term as the feature for tweet classification. TF-IDF aims to identify the most frequent words, whereas stemming aims to retrieve the stem of the word by removing the inflectional derivations. The dataset that has been used is Modern Arabic Corpus which consists of Arabic tweets. The performance of classification has been evaluated based on the information retrieval metrics precision, recall, and f-measure.

Usually, the APF assumes the robot is modeled as a point mass. It means that the robot can move in any direction and neglect the nonholonomic constraint. In order to solve such a problem, the APF should be considered as part of the control system. This research proposed an approach integrating APF and control system under nonholonomic constraint. Naturally, the force of the APF can be used as linear velocity in the control system. Then, waypoint of APF is used as equilibrium point of kinematic control. In order to validate the proposed method, the experimental setup conducted on loop simulation. The scenario is that the robot moves along the certain trajectory to reach the goal point. The obstacle was set in between the robot and the goal point. The initial, goal, and the obstacles are set randomly. The experiments show that the integration of the proposed method can be implemented successfully.

Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the effect of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived trust on managers' acceptance of EC in SMEs. In order to achieve this, the study used the technology acceptance model (TAM). The study used a survey that administered to 250 managers of SMEs from Palestine. The data was analysed employing a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach through partial least square (PLS) software. The results revealed that perceived trust and perceived usefulness had positive effects on the participating managers' behavioural intention to adopt EC services. It also found that the manager's perception, including their perceived ease of use, significantly affected their perceived trust of using EC services. Moreover, perceived ease of use had a significant impact on perceived usefulness. However, the managers' perceived ease of use failed to predict their intention to adopt such EC services, and perceived usefulness failed to predict their perceived trust.

It is use as food and fruits packaging, fruit bag, food container, seedling bag, mulching film, protective for greenhouse, dryer shed and among others. However, this generates higher quantity of wastes that are difficult to dispose by farmers. The plastic residues remain on the soil for some years as large pieces and they are impediment to plant growth and also a potential hazard to animals if the land is subsequently put down to grass. To address these problems, the project aim to develop and evaluate the biodegradable film for mango fruit bag during development. Cassava starch and polybutylene succinate (PBS) was used in the development biodegradable film. The PBS and starch was melt-blended in a twinscrew extruder and then blown into film extrusion machine. The physic-chemical-mechanical properties of biodegradable fruit bag were done following standard methods of test. Field testing of fruit bag was also conducted to evaluate its durability and efficiency field condition. The PHilMech-FiC fruit bag is made of biodegradable material measuring 6 x 8 inches with a thickness of 150 microns. The tensile strength is within the range of LDPE while the elongation is within the range of HDPE. However, it has higher density, thickness swelling and absorbed more water. It is projected that after thirty six (36) weeks, the film will be totally degraded.

Utilities metaphorically evaluate alternatives and approximate the satisfaction afforded by each. The utilitarian model is considered the fundamental basis of several artificial intelligence techniques such as game theory, evolutionary, heuristic, and fuzzy based approaches. It has been immensely utilized to develop various intelligent systems such as Decision Support Systems (DSS), Negotiation Support Systems (NSS), Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Shopbots, and proxy bidding systems. Well known that the utilitarian model has been developed based on the hypothesis of rationality and maximization which embodied some secular norms. Islam, on the other hand, has been derived from a diverse set of provisions in which highly upholds tender values and pays significance to moral issues. As a consequence, this paper conducts a brief comparison and deduced two commons bases and four discrepancies. In the time Islam accepts utilitarian conception and do not mind the acquisitive behaves which considered essential in life success but satirically criticizes egoistic encouragement, non-satiation, and un-prioritized preferences. The Islamic objections on the utilitarian decision are not necessarily meant the solid inapplicability but a reasonable treatment out to take place in order to be Islamic legitimated. Introducing the altruistic utility supposedly drops the egoistic objection and then a satiated lexicographic utility hoped to cancel the rest of contradictions. The adoption of those treatments ought to assist in developing intelligent systems that rely on Islamic legitimated decision method which upholds the Islamic moral injunctions. It is hoped that this research will provide the impetus for researchers to propose systems that rely on Islamic legitimate decision making.","Islamic utility; Islamic utility model; Utilitarian decision making",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

This is due to the four features of agents: proactive, reactivity, social ability and autonomy. However, psychological reactance is one of the major limiting causes of agent interventions. Although, many studies have investigated into both psychological reactance and behaviour change nevertheless how reactive intervention can be supported to obtain an improved behaviour change intervention is still lacking in most previous studies. Therefore, this paper describes the formal analysis of agent support model for behaviour change intervention. The analysis made use of two widely accepted approaches in agent formal evaluation namely mathematical analysis and automated verification. The mathematical analysis examined the correctness of the formal model representation and formalization that aimed to ensure that all syntax and semantic representations used in the formal model is consistent. The mathematical analysis used equilibrium property to explore the formal model consistency. Likewise, automated verification depicts the checking of the model properties against its specifications and theoretical traces. The automated verification used Temporal Trace Language (TTL), which verifies the model properties and states against generated traces.

Paying attention to the scale is one of the most common procedures in assessing the maps usability. The average size delineation (ASD), effective scale number (ESN), index of maximum reduction (IMR) and shape complexity index (SCI) are the maps quality criteria that can be examined. The purposes of this study were: a) to evaluate the EC and SAR maps of the farm lands affected by the Kaveh-Soda factory effluent on the basis of the above quality criteria and b) to evaluate the efficiency of continuous and intermittent methods of leaching in three Saline-Sodic soils with loam and sandy loam textures. EC maps of the area were selected and ASD, ESN, IMR and SCI were determined as 0.95 cm2, 1:26000, 1.54 and 3.33, respectively. For the SAR maps the above criteria were 1.33 cm2, 1:31000, 1.84 and 3.51, respectively. According to the above criteria there should be no limitation in their uses for developing of agricultural and civil engineering projects. It is known that optimum IMR is equal to 2, so that raising IMR of EC and SAR maps from 1.54 and 1.84 to 2 led their scale to increase from 1:34000 to 1:26000 and 1:31000, respectively and increase maps contrast as well. At the subsequent stage, efficiency of two leaching methods of saline-sodic soils was examined after knowing the usability of the maps and separating their units, as affected by Kaveh-Soda factory (Maragheh). For this purpose, PVC tubes (Lengths= 70 cm; Diameter= 10 cm) were prepared and filled with soil (5200 g sieved by 4.76 mm). The flow rate during both leaching methods was selected to be 1.25 KS of the columns. Soil columns were grouped according their EC as 1) EC= 10.38 dSm-1, with Na+= 49.64 meqL-1; 2) EC= 20.6 dSm-1, with Na+= 94.57 meqL-1; and 3) EC= 36.6 dSm-1, with Na+ = 166.11 meqL-1. Leaching water was saturated with gypsum because of it's high SAR to disperse the soil and effectively reduce the leaching efficiency. The EC of leaching water was 2.34 dSm-1. Leaching was stopped when EC of the effluent from the columns became relatively constant. The results revealed that intermittent leaching method efficiency was 8% greater than that of continuous method. The depth water need for the reclamation of the affected soils was also calculated.","Continuous; Intermittent; Iran; Kaveh-soda; Leaching; Soil map",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Coconut water is widely used as isotonic drink or oral rehydration fluid, since it showed excellent rehydration index and blood glucose response in previous researches. The quality of isotonic drink is determined by its sugar content (as the source of carbohydrate) and electrolyte content. Moreover, its organoleptic properties should be able to stimulate the urge to spontaniously drink more. However, the processing of coconut water into isotonic drink usually applies ultra high or very low temperature which might deteriorate its nutrition value and organoleptic properties, causing the needs to use a considerable amount of food additives. There are plenty varieties of coconut in Indonesia, each produces different characteristics of coconut water. The objectives of this research are to compare the carbohydrate-electrolyte characteristics of coconut water, and also other essential characteristics from several varieties and to determine which variety is closest to the quality standard of isotonic drink. Therefore, isotonic drink can be developed with only minimum food additives. We compared Dalam Pangandaran, Genjah Salak and Hybrid PB121.

Moreover, RSS was produced aimed to control of the adequate qualities caused by the variation characteristics of sweetpotato. The making of RSS from 3 sweetpotato varieties was to study physicochemical and sensory attributes of the final product. RSS was produced using three sweetpotato (SP) varieties with different flesh colour namely White, Yellow and Orange. Samples, including raw materials, intermediate and final products were analyzed for physicochemical attributes. White and Orange cultivars judged generated the good quality RSS. A similar hardness and shearing force of RSS made of White and Orange was found. Proximate compositions on dry base (db) were: protein 3.59 and 2.74%, fat 21.44 and 35.91%, carbohydrate 71.83 and 59.19%; and ash 3.13 and 2.17%, respectively. White cultivar produced the RSS having yellow bright colour, high firmness and low fat content, whereas Orange cultivar generated RSS with bright orange colour, medium firmness but high fat content.

The need to capacitate the community's social and human capital in addressing climate change impacts to their livelihood, properties and natural environment is deemed necessary to lessen their vulnerability issues in the management of agriecotourism destinations. The study aimed to 1.) characterize and rank hazards that are likely to affect the nature-based tourism communities, 2.) describe the nature-based tourism communities' current sensitivity and exposure to climate stresses; and 3.) estimate future vulnerability and risks of nature-based tourism communities. Three agri-ecotourism communities were selected using five criteria such as attraction uniqueness, hazard type, risk level, tourism dependency and market potential. The areas were subjected to tourism vulnerability case assessment focusing on services and energy; human health; food, security, water and agriculture; business and continuity; and biodiversity and culture. Calaguas Island's top hazards are typhoon, drought and strong wind. Pecuaria Farm's main hazards are drought, rat infestation and grass fire while Bulusan Lake's major hazards are heavy rains and ash falls brought by volcanic eruption. Generally, vulnerability is high in the human health, services and energy sectors of tourism. The vulnerability of the three agri-ecotourism sites was intensified by factors that merely characterize the kind of community they have: a) high marketing dependency, b) poor political will, c) low level of awareness and preparedness, d) poor farming practices and e) lack of tourism-related livelihood options. Destinations with functioning agricultural areas are the most affected sites due to an estimated increase in the temperature and increase in rainfall precipitations. Poverty remains to be the major factor why vulnerability is high.","Agri-ecotourism communities; Climate change; Philippines; Vulnerability assessment",,"Hidalgo, H.A.; College of Economics and Management, Central Bicol State, University of AgriculturePhilippines; email: hanilyn77@yahoo.com",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Most of the commercial crackers are carbohydrate-rich and normally considered as a low value-added product. In this study, innovative value added crackers made of jackfruit were developed. The effect of starches (sago and cassava) and levels of jackfruit (30 and 50%, w/w) on characteristics of the crackers were investigated. Physicochemical properties of the products at each predetermined processing steps (steaming, drying and frying); bulk density, expansion ratio, color and carotenoid contents were measured. A decrease in jackfruit level resulted in crackers with lower bulk density (0.26 to 0.41 g/cm3) and higher volume expansion ratio (2.84 to 4.66 cm3). Blending the cassava and sago starch at 1:1 ratio resulted in lower bulk density and higher expansion ratio compared to crackers made with a single type of starch. The L* and b* values decreased with drying and frying process, indicative of Maillard reactions. The higher L* value was influenced by the starch content, while higher jackfruit led increased the b* values, attributed to the presence of pigments in the fruit. Total carotenoid contents of fried crackers increased following steaming process, ranging from 0.061 to 0.199 mg/100g and samples made with blend of sago and cassava has the highest carotenoid contents. A jackfruit level of 30% (w/w) made with blend of sago and cassava starches (1:1) produced fried crackers with the most acceptable physicochemical characteristics.

Coffee is a rich source of antioxidants, therefore research on antioxidant properties of Robusta coffee beans is important to explore its market value. Nowadays, most of coffee analysis is on conventional roasted coffee which reduces their antioxidant properties. In this study, Robusta coffee beans (Coffea canephora) were subjected to superheated steam roasting at 200, 220 and 240 °C for 20-40 min to obtain light, medium and dark roast. The effect of different roasting temperature and time on the total phenolic content (TPC) and radical scavenging activity (RSA) of Robusta coffee bean was investigated. Total phenolic content of coffee brews decreased with the increase of roasting degree due to the degradation of phenolic compounds. The highest phenolic content was found at 220 °C for 20 min. Meanwhile, brews extracted from light roasted coffee and medium roasted at 220 °C for 20 min showed a maximum scavenging activity than those from green coffee. Brews from dark roasted coffee showed lowest radical scavenging activity and total phenol content. Hence, based on the results from this study, the best superheated steam roasting condition is at 220 °C for 20 min (medium roast) to achieve a maximum antioxidant activity and highest phenolic content.","Radical scavenging activity; Robusta coffee; Superheated steam roasting; Total phenolic content",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

However, CPO is a food resource. This drives Indonesia to find another alternative source for biodiesel production. One promising source is Jatropha curcas L. which is considered as non-edible industrial plant used for biodiesel fuel. Jatropha curcas could be planted in marginal soil, semi dry climate, and suitable in tropical and subtropic climate. According to those aforementioned situations, an effort to address this issue should be conducted by identifying and presenting actual condition of Indonesian palm oil and Jatropha curcas estate. In this research, LCA is used to analyze the prospect of oil palm and Jatropha curcas development. The impact assessment calculation on stable production is lower than before-stable production. By considering that 4/5 or 20 years of 25 years of its life cycle lie on stable production, appropriate calculation method is needed. Agrochemical utilization such as fertilizer, insecticides, pesticides, and fungicides produces significant contribution to environmental impact in biodiesel production. It is accounted by 50.46% for oil palm and 33.51% for Jatropha curcas. The use of organic fertilizer very influences the reduction of GHG emission value in fertilization sub-process. It could reduce up to 96.2 % for oil palm and 76.8% for Jatropha curcas. In term of electricity generation, shows that Jatropha curcas oil based biodiesel is better than fossil fuel.

We know that, in some cases, lower technology readiness will be accepted by the users; these could be end-users, but, more often, it will be used in companies. The impact of a too early or too late adopted technology can be huge for companies and can even threaten market position or the existence of the company itself. Research institutes and technology developers, in particular application-oriented research organizations, might be also interested in which parameters or technology attributes should be improved or extended, according to the addressed application field, so that the technology fulfils the market-requested functions and a fast diffusion in the market can be achieved. Existing technology readiness models cover the various usages of the technology. In many cases, they assess the technology's use in across different industries and application fields. However, the requirements in many fields are mostly different and very specific; thus, evaluation at such a high level can't conclude whether the technology should be considered and adopted in the applications involved.

Indica IR.64 rice straw is one of abundant agricultural wastes in Indonesia and could be used to bioethanol production. It has several characteristics such as high content of cellulose and hemicelluloses that can be readily hydrolyzed into fermentable sugars. A simple process (the direct saccharification and fermentation process) to produce ethanol from rice straw was developed in order to establish an efficient bioethanol production. In this work, no harsh pre-treatment steps were applied and also use a simple one-vat reactor without the risk of losing liberated carbohydrate. The first step in using rice straw for bioethanol production is size reduction through milling and sieving process prior to enzymatic hydrolysis. Direct saccharification and fermentation (DSF) of Indica IR.64 rice straw was examined and compared with two type of control (systems devoid of yeast and enzyme). The experiment were carried out under anaerobic condition, where the cellulase crude enzyme and cellulosic substrates (rice straw) produced glucose from the cellulose and Saccharomyces cerevisiae directly assimilated the glucose to bioethanol. The faster rate of bioethanol production during DSF by Saccharomyces cerevisiae was obtained within the first 12h. The maximum ethanol concentration, ethanol yield, and theoretical ethanol yield of untreated rice straw were 0.25 g/L, 10 and 14.88%, respectively. Nevertheless, the direct saccharification and fermentation shows the potential for lower cost and higher efficiency for bioethanol production.","Bioethanol; Direct saccharification and fermentation; Lignocellulosic waste; Rice straw",,"Juanssilfero, A.B.; Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI), Research Center for Biotechnology, Cibinong Science CenterIndonesia; email: ario002@lipi.go.id",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The estimation showed that the rice production in these areas are being threatened and will be worsen if there is no appropriate plan to cope with the changes in climate condition and extreme events. The results for the simulation model of paddy yield under different scenarios showed decreases in the paddy yield in Mekong River Delta. Specifically, the yield of Spring paddy decreases 6%, Autumn paddy decreases 2%, Winter paddy decreases 4% and Autumn-winter paddy decreases 4% in 2050. From these results, the climate change adaptation and mitigation policies in this delta is suggested to be focused reducing the exposure to sea level rise; upgrading the irrigation system for paddy planting since the coastal provinces have high rate of rain-fed paddy, vulnerability can also be reduced by enhancing the adaptive capacity of provinces through subsidizing and providing farmers with new paddy varieties which are more tolerant to salinity.","Climate change; Floods; Mekong river delta; Rice production; Vulnerability",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Numerous literatures report that myristicin is responsible for hallucinogenic effects, which induced by the consumption of nutmeg due to its metabolism structure of 3-methoxy-4,5-methylendioxyamphetamine (MMDA). Minimum dosage of nutmeg that can cause psychogenic effect is 5 g (ground nutmeg) with 1 to 2 mg myristicin content and this dosage is considered as 'toxic dose'. At higher dosage of myristicin death may occur. Additionally, Myristicin poisoning can lead to many health problems that related to brain problem. Those symptoms usually occur 3 to 6 hours after ingestion of myristicin or foodstuffs containing it, and effects may persist up to 72 hours.

Forest soil is the most important element of forest ecosystem that has key roles in forest managing. Therefore, studying of soil properties and evolution under different environmental conditions is necessary for sustainable management of forest ecosystems. Spatial variation of soil properties is significantly influenced by some environmental factors that slope position is one of them. The aim of this study was evaluating effects of slope position on forest soil change which was carried out in Arasbaran forest, North-West of Iran. Nine soil profiles were dug, described and sampled in three different parts of an altitudinal transect with same environmental conditions and different slope positions. Then soil samples were analysed physicaly and chemicaly and so classified based on Soil Taxonomy 2014. Also according to obtained results One-way analysis of variance was used to test relations of soil properties and slope positions. This results revealed significant effect of slope positions on thickness of the soil profile and solum, clay, organic carbon and total nitrogen percentages and cation exchange capacity at 5% level of confidence which lead to change of type, depth and sequence of soil horizons along altitudinal transect. Finally, it has found that slope position not only has important role in soil properties changes and soil evolution but also it can't be refused the various role and influence of same forest stand in different slope positions. Therefore various soils such as Inceptisols, Alfisols and Molisols were observed under different slope positions. Then it can be achieved that, because of special forest vegetation, soil evolution along altitudinal transect of forest ecosystems are differing from other ecosystems. Thus, for forest soil management program it is necessary to consider both of topography and vegetation effect over the area, even if one of them is constant.","Arasbaran forest; Elevation gradient; Forest soil; Slope position; Soil type",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

The concentration of urban and rural poverty in developing countries underpins the importance of agriculture as a poverty reduction strategy since most of the poor people depend on agriculture. Thus, improving agricultural productivity, competitiveness and sustainability may reduce poverty. This study was intended to (1) find out if sustainable agriculture, i.e., horticultural organic farming practices, could contribute to poverty reduction, (2) identify restrictive factors affecting horticulture organic farming development, and (3) formulate alternative policy intervention for poverty alleviation based on development of organic farming. The respondents were selected using purposive sampling method, comprising of 22 selfclaimed horticultural organic farmers and 22 horticultural conventional farmers. The data were gathered through a structuredquestionnaire and in-depth interview. Descriptive statistics, prospective analyses and analytical hierarchy process were used to analyze the data. The results showed that organic farming practices have potential to increase income of the horticultural farmers. Factors that constrained the development of horticultural organic farming were limited knowledge of organic practices, access to market, financial and risk management services or support. Alternative policy interventions, such as developing a linkage between producers and consumers, strengthening research and development on organic farming, enhancing dissemination knowledge of organic farming practices, and providing access to financial and agriculture management, are proposed.","Horticulture; Organic farming; Poverty",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

In general, mandarin orange byproducts have no economic value, even though their composition is rich in soluble sugars, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin and essential oils that could form the basis of several industrial processes. The purpose of this study was to characterize pectin from byproducts and to study their application as a fat replacer in cookies. When pectin solutions were subjected to steady-shear measurements, shear-thinning behavior was observed. The flow behaviors could be described by the Cross model (R2 = 0.84), and temperature effects were investigated by the Arrhenius equation. When pectin-enriched material were incorporated into cookie formulations in place of shortening (semisolid fat generally used in baked foods) up to 30 % by the weight of shortening, the cookie spread diameter was reduced while the color has no significant difference with control. Surprisingly, the use of mandarin orange pectin at different prosentation as fat replacer reduce the fat content significantly. Thus mandarin orange pectin proved to be a promising alternative as a fat replacer in cookies production.","Cookies; Fat replacer; Mandarin orange byproducts; Pectin-enriched material",,"Prihatin, A.; School of Biosystems Engineering and Food Science, Zhejiang University, Yuhantang Road 866, China; email: agusprihatin@zju.edu.cn",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Retrieving data using the method of observation at 27 group ""Simantri"", at 3 altitude / topography (lowland, medium and high). Variables measured: feed amount given, type and diversity of feed ingredients and proportions, sampling of feed materials, and take the liquid contents rumen. Sampling feed material to determine the nutrient content and digestibility of the ration, while knowing VFA rumen fluid contents (total and partial) and N-NH3. The results showed the higher the percentage of a natural grass in the lower ration. This condition causes the higher topography and diversity of the types of feed materials more and more. The proportion of shrub legume Gliricidia leaves of trees, especially in the diet is relatively small (6.6%), while the potential of Gliricidia leaves pretty much at all altitude. Judging from the fulfilment of nutrients, Bali cow rations at all topographic meet the needs/head/day in the range of 6.10 to 8.14 kgDM, protein (CP) ± of 750,2g and energy ± 12 526 kcal ME. In the test VFA rumen fluid obtained from 71.68 to 85.07 mMol in the category enough, while N-NH3: 5,21-6,11mMol still relatively low. From this study we can conclude supply of feed for Bali cow in the group ""Simantri"" program in Bali nutrient content rations have to meet the needs. The higher the proportion of legume shrub tree (Gliricidia leaves) the digestibility, VFA production and N-NH3 getting better.","Bali cow; Digestibility; Food availability; Fulfillment of nutrients",,"Dewa Nyoman Sudita, I.; Faculty of Agriculture, Warmadewa University-DenpasarIndonesia; email: dewasudita@yahoo.com",,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.
