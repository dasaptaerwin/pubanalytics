Physic nut seeds with initial moisture content of 7.9% were stored in plastic bags under warehouse conditions. Samples of physic nut were collected before storage, and subsequently after one to six months of storage. The results showed that the moisture contents increased after one month of storage, and became relatively constant up to six months of storage. The range of moisture contents (7.9 - 8.4%) was safe for storage of physic nut seeds. Sixteen fungal species were isolated from physic nut seeds during six months of storage. Fungal population decreased with the increase of storage duration. At the beginning of storage, most of the fungi that infected the seeds were classified as field fungi, such as Colletotrichum sp., Cladosporium spp., and Fusarium spp.. Their populations decreased with the increase of storage duration. After three months of storage, the existence of field fungi was generally replaced by storage fungi, such as Aspergillus spp., and Penicillium spp. dominate the population. Lipid contents, viabilities and vigors decreased with the increase of storage duration, while free fatty acids and lipase activities increased. Under uncontrolled conditions, physic nut seeds packed in plastic material can be stored up to one month for seeds to be planted, while it can be stored up to five months for producing oil. © 2008, Seameo Biotrop.","Free fatty acid; Fungi; Jatropha curcas L; Lipase; Lipid; Physic nut; Storage duration; Viability; Vigor",,,,,,,,"Adikadarsih, S., Hartono, J., Pengaruh Kemasan Buah terhadap Mutu Benih Jarak Pagar (Jatropha curcas L (2006) Paper presented at Lokakarya II: Status Teknologi Tanaman Jarak Pagar, , Pusat Penelitian dan Pengembangan Perkebunan, Departemen Pertanian.

Thus, this research study looks at the taxonomic diversity and distribution of plasmodial myxomycetes in La Mesa Ecopark in Quezon City, Philippines. A total of 240 moist chambers were prepared from four substrates (aerial and ground leaf litter, twigs and barks) collected within this ecopark. Following incubation of moist chambers for eight weeks, a total of 28 species belonging to 10 genera were collected and identified: Arcyria (3), Diderma (2), Didymium (5), lamproderma (2), Perichaena (3), Physarum (8), Macbrideola (1), Metatrichia (1), Trichia (1) and Stemonitis (2). Highest myxomycete yield (85%) was observed in aerial leaf litter. In terms of taxonomic diversity, highest diversity was observed in bark microhabitats, although the lowest number of species was recorded in it. Assessment of their abundance and distribution showed similarities in species composition between aerial and ground leaf litter. This research study is the first report of plasmodial myxomycetes in La Mesa Ecopark in Quezon City, Philippines.","Microhabitats; Myxomycetes; Recreational forest; Slime molds","Arcyria; Diderma; Didymium; Lamproderma; Macbrideola; Metatrichia (slime mold); Myxogastria; Perichaena; Physarum; Stemonitis; Trichia (Mycetozoa)",,,,,,,"Alexopoulos, C., The Myxomycetes II (1963) The Botanical Review, 29 (1), pp. 1-78; Blackwell, M., (1984) Myxomycetes and their arthropod associates.

Our research study then focuses on the diversity and abundance of myxomycetes found in Anda Island, Pangasinan in Northern Philippines. A total of 180 moist chambers were prepared from ground leaf litter and twigs collected from a 15 m quadrat within the study site. Twenty four species of myxomycetes belonging to 11 genera were collected and identified from the moist chambers:Arcyria (2),Collaria (1),Comatricha (1),Craterium (2),Diachea (1),Diderma (2) Didymium (1),Elaeomyxa (1),Perichaena (1),Physarum (11), and Stemonitis (1). Of all moist chambers, 55% yielded myxomycetes. Ground leaf litter (29%) yielded more myxomycetes than twigs (26%). Assessment of species diversity (H =1.15), richness (H =5.33) and evenness (E=0.56) showed rich assemblage of myxomycetes. Among the collected species, one for each of the genera Arcyria Craterium, Diderma,Physarum and were recorded to be abundant. Interestingly, three species of myxomycetes are new records for the Philippines: Craterium microcarpum, Physarum decipiens and Elaeomyxa miyazakiensis.

The objectives of the researchwere (a) to obtain information on the postharvest handling of nutmeg kernels; (b) to investigate the occurrence of fungi (includingA. flavus) and aflatoxin contamination in stored nutmeg kernels and (c) to measure moisture content and percentage of damaged nutmeg kernels. Methods used in this study included survey, interviews and sample collection in the delivery chain. This study was conducted in April and May 2013, in three regions (NorthMinahasa, Siau Tagulandang Biaro (Sitaro) and Sangihe Talaud) and two cities (Bitung and Manado). The total number of nutmeg kernels samples collected from different points of the delivery chain was 76. It consisted of samples collected from farmers (25 samples), collectors (22) and exporters (29). The results showed that, the moisture content of nutmeg kernels collected from North Sulawesi Province was not higher than the maximum limit of moisture content determined by Indonesian National Standard or SNI (10%). Nutmeg kernels collected from farmers and collectors had a high percentage of damaged kernels. Aspergillus niger and Endomyces fibuliger were the dominant fungi infecting nutmeg kernels collected from farmers and collectors, while Eurotium repens was the dominant fungus found infecting nutmeg kernels stored by the exporters. Aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin contents nutmeg kernels samples collected fromfarmer and exporter 1 of s s were relatively high.Based on statistical analysis using non-parametric analysis, the effect of delivery chain did not give any significant differences onmoisture content, percentage of damaged nutmeg kernels, total fungal population and total aflatoxin content. Our study suggested that the postharvest handling methods of nutmeg kernels conducted by farmers, collectors and exporters in North Sulawesi Province (NorthMinahasa, Sitaro and Sangihe Talaud regions), Bitung andManado cities should be improved tominimize aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin contamination. © 2015 Seameo Biotrop.","Aflatoxin; Delivery chain; Fungi; Myristica fragrans; North Sulawesi Province; Nutmeg kernels",,,,,,,,"Bas appa, S.C., (2009) Aflatoxins; Formation, Analysis and Control, , New Delhi (I N):Narosa Publishing House; (2012) Peningkatan produksi, produktivitas dan mutu tanaman rempah dan penyegar, , Pedoman Teknis Perluasan Tanaman PalaTahun 2012.

Animal pollinators are thought to contribute between 15 and 30% of global food production and bees are recognized to be the most important taxon. The pollination effectiveness of two species of bees, Apis cerana and A. mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in Jatropha curcas (Euphorbiaceae) was studied. Three cages, made of insect screen were set up. Each cage contains three individual plants. One colony of A. mellifera and A. cerana were placed in the first and second cage, while the third cage was used for control plants. Bee colonies were placed during one month in the first and second cages. Fruit set of plants pollinated by A. mellifera, A. cerana, control plants, and open plants were counted and compared. Pollination by honeybees increased the number of fruits per plant and fruits per raceme of J. curcas. Based on measuring of fruit produced by plants, pollination effectiveness of A. mellifera was higher than A. carana. © 2008, Seameo Biotrop.","A. mellifera; Apis cerana; Effectiveness; Jatropha curcas; Pollination; Seed set",,,,,,,,"Atmowidi, T., Buchori, D., Manuwoto, S., Suryobroto, B., Hidayat, P., Diversity of insect pollinators and seed set of mustard (Brassica rapa: Brassicaceae) (2007) Hayati, 14, pp. 155-161; Faegry, K., van Der Pijl, L., (1971) The Principles of Pollination Ecology, , Ed ke-2.

This condition influenced growth of chlorophyll-α and primary production. To investigate changes of primary production in Jakarta Bay due to anthropogenic and climate change impacts, a field measurement, laboratory experiment and collection of several data sets have been conducted. The study showed that impact of anthropogenic, particularly sediment load from the land to primary production is important. The intensification of primary production occurs in the middle region of Jakarta Bay, while the chlorophyll-α concentration is high in the river mouth area. The anthropogenic impact is indicated by the land use change that has increased to 73% during the last ten years. The laboratory experiments by injecting CO2 in the waters, as a global warming simulation, have shown a decrease in chlorophyll-α and primary production. Therefore, the combination of anthropogenic and climate change may have a double impact on the Jakarta Bay ecosystem.","Anthropogenic; Climate change; Impact; Jakarta bay; Primary production",,,,,,,,"Ambarwulan, W., (2002) MSc Thesis, p. 131. , Mapping of TSM concentrations from SPOT and Landsat TM Satellite Images for Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Teluk Banten, Indonesia.

These snails are known as ""Golden Apple Snail"" (GAS), an introduced species from Argentina. Pomacea canaliculata or known as ""keong mas, keongmurbei"" was introduced in Indonesia around 1983, and after more than 20 years, it now can be found very abundant at various habitats such as marshes, ponds, irrigations, lakes and rice fields in almost all places in Indonesia. Based on the collections of these snails deposited in the MZB (Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense, Research Center for Biology) and secondary data (references), the distribution of these two snails was studied. Pomacea canaliculata is widely distributed, while P. insularum is only found at Lake Semayang and Lake Balikpapan in Kalimantan. The distribution map is presented and will be useful as a basic information to manage these invasive snails.","Distribution; Indonesia; Invasive; Pomacea canaliculata and p. insularum; Snail",,,,,,,,"Adalla, C.B., Magsino, E., Understanding the golden apple snail (Pomacea canaliculata): Biology and early initiatives to control the pest in the Philippines (2006) Global Advances in Ecology and Management of Golden Apple Snails, pp. 199-213. , RCJoshi & LS Sebastian (Eds), Philrice.

This is presumed causing population decline and potentially causing loss of genetic diversity. Genetic diversity level within population can be obtained by population genetic study using molecular marker such as randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Here we amplified RAPD marker using ten arbitrary primers to assess genetic diversity of P. erosa population in the Segara Anakan Cilacap to provide genetic data for its sustainable use. The results proved that the use of RAPD marker has high polymorphisms. The mud clam population also showed a high level of heterozygosity and genetic diversity.

Biodegradation is considered to be the cheapest and the most effective method to clean-up cyanide from the environment. Several studies on different types of microorganisms that can degrade cyanide in the environment have been carried out. Hydrolytic, oxidative, reductive and substitutive/transfer reactions are some of the common pathways used by microorganisms in cyanide degradation. Biodegradation of cyanide can occur aerobically or anaerobically depending on the environmental conditions. Immobilized enzymes or microorganisms prove to be very effective method of degradation. Microorganisms such as Klebsiella oxytoca, Corynebacterium nitrophilous, Brevibacterium nitrophilous, Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Rhodococcus UKMP-5M have been reported to be very effective in biodegradation of cyanide. © 2015 Seameo Biotrop.","Biodegradation; Cyanide; Environment; Microorganisms",,,,,,,,"Akcil, A., Destruction of cyanide in gold mill effluents: biological versus chemical treatments (2003) Bioteclinol Adv, 21, pp. 501-511; Akcil, A., Karahan, A.G., Ciftci, H., Sagdic, O., Biological treatment of cyanide by natural isolated bacteria (Pseudomonassp.)

Six soil cores of 5 cm in diameter and 10 cm depth were sampled from each of 24 fields. All samples from each individual field were bulked and placed in plastic trays of 38 × 25 × 10 cm. Soil was moistened as required and emergence of weed seedlings were recorded over period of one year. After one year, remaining seeds were separated, removed and identified. The total seed bank was estimated at 1136.48 million/ha of which 62.35% (708.60 million seedlings ha""1) germinated within 12 months and 37.65% (427.88 million seeds ha""1) remained ungerminated. Total of 20 taxa were recognized. Based on importance value (I.V.) the five most dominant species in terms of emerged seedling were Fimbristylis miliacea, Leplochloa chinensis, LitJwigia hyssopifolia, Cyperus difformii and C. iria. Of the remaining seeds the five dominant species with decreasing trend in ranking were F. miliacea, Scirpus lateriflonis, Monochoria vagina/is, L. hyssopifolia and L. chinensis. Ranking of total seed reserves (seedlings+ remaining seeds) were similar to emerged seedling indicating that emerged seedlings reflect the actual weed flora in the Muda area. Among the dominant species F. miliacea accounted for 58.07% of emerged seedlings, 79.31% of remaining seeds and 66.07% of total seed bank. Total seedling emergence of all species was higher in the first observation in April 2003 and cumulative seedling emergence showed no clear peaks. © 2006, Seameo Biotrop.","Malaysia; Ricefield soils; Seedbank; Seedling emergence; Weeds",,,,,,"Third World Organization for Women in Science, TWOWS

The disease is caused by bacterial infection and induced by drastic changes of water quality. Lysozyme has the ability to break down bacterial cell wall. The purpose of this research was to construct of a binary vector pMSH1-Lys carrying chicken Lysozyme (Lys) gene and to introduce pMSH1-Lys on K.alvarezii. The binary vector expression was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 by triparental mating. Thallus was inoculated with A. tumefaciens carrying pMSH1-Lys and then the transformed thallus was selected by adding 20 mg/L hygromycin to the culture medium. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis showed that the construction of the binary plasmid pMSH1-Lys was established. Percentage of pMSH1-Lys transformation on Kappaphycus alvarezii was 23.56%, while the efficiency of regeneration was 11.32%. PCR analysis showed that three of the regenerated thallus contained Lysozyme gene. Thus, transgenic Kappaphycus alvarezii was successfully produced. These findings can be useful for studying the mechanisms of seaweed defense against bacterial infection.","Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Genetic transformation; Kappaphycus alvarezii; Lysozyme","Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Bacteria (microorganisms); Kappaphycus alvarezii",,,,,,,"Amiluddin, N.M., A study of growth and carrageenan content of Seaweed Kappaphycusalvarezii that are affected by Ice-ice disease in Pari Island, Thousand Islands.

Indonesia is one of the leading countries of papaya production after India and Brazil. The Centre of Tropical Fruits Study (PKBT) at Bogor Agricultural University (IPB), Indonesia, has started a long- term breeding program since 2003 in order to improve the quality of local papayas. Fruit exports are being targeted at more specialized consumers, who are either seeking products either raised in more environmentally and health-conscious ways or those with a significant outstanding flavour. Flavour continues to be the predominant quality characteristic important for a successful international marketing. To understand the biosynthesis pathways are becoming more important for the flavour industry in recent years, as this could aid in the production of the flavour volatiles in the same manner as the natural biosynthesis. It is also necessary to understand the aroma active compounds and their changes during processing because unexpected changes in aroma may cause a product unmarketable even if other quality factors are acceptable. Understanding the changes of aroma active compounds in the papaya fruit, such as loss of desirable flavour and development of offflavour during processing will be very helpful for determining proper processing condition. The flavour composition of papaya fruit is reviewed in this paper. This paper presents an overview of important publications regarding the characteristic features of the biology of the fruits, consumption worldwide, commercial application in food processing, though the review of biogenesis of volatiles isstill the main focus.","Biogenesis; Flavour; Papaya (Carica papaya L.); Review; Tropical fruit; Volatiles",,,,,,,,"Almora, K., Pino, J.A., Hernandez, M., Duarte, C., Gonzalez, J., Roncal, E., Evaluation of volatiles from ripening papaya (Carica papayaL., varMaradol roja) (2004) Food Chem, 86 (1), pp. 127-130; Riset Unggulan Buah Tropis Indonesia, (accessedonOctober 20th, 2007).

Unfortunately, the area is now invaded by Merremia peltata or mantangan occupying about 7000 ha of the area. The aim of this study was to determine the ecological impacts of mantangan on plant species composition at BBSNP. Three sites with different disturbance regimes were selected for vegetation analysis and assessment on plant species composition: primary forest representing undisturbed area, secondary forest representing burned area, and invaded forest representing forest invaded by mantangan. Three line transects were constructed at each locations along 1 km, and the nested sampling plotswere set up every 100m with the following quadrant's size: 20mx 20mfor trees, 10m x 10mfor poles, 5m x 5mfor sapling, and 2mx 2mfor seedling. Data collection covered the degree of mantangan invasion, trees species and diameter. Results showed that invaded forest has lower plant diversity index (1.90) than the other two forests. This was caused by the invasion of mantangan as the percentage of coverage in the invaded forest reached 44% compared to secondary and the primary forest, whichwere 27.11% and 1.00%, respectively. Percentage of mantangan coverage and diversity showed a strong negative correlation (-0.988).","Bukit barisan selatan national park; Impact; Invasive species; Mantangan; Merremia peltata",,,,,,,,"Rencana Pengelolaan Taman Nasional Bukit Barisan Selatan (1999), [BTNBBS] Balai Taman Nasional Bukit Barisan Selatan.

Before cultured cottonii seaweeds collected from the Natuna Islands (Riau Islands Province) were acclimatized in greenhouse and in semi-sterile culture in the laboratory. Sterilized explants were cultured on PES and Conwy media solidified with 0.8% Bacto Agar. In each of these media two combinations of plant growth regulators i.e. BA+IAA and BA+NAA were added. The concentrations of BA used were 0, 0.5, 1 mg/l, the concentrations of IAA were 0, 2.5, 5 mg/l, whereas the concentration of NAA were 0, 0.5, 1 mg/l. The result indicated that the optimal medium for callus induction was PES solidified medium supplemented with BA 1 mg/l. Types of callus formed were (a) white compact callus, (b) white filamentous callus, (c) greenish/brownish callus. Regeneration of callus into clumps of filament had been done by subculturing the callus into PES solidified medium supplemented withBA1 mg/l+IAA 2.5 mg/l.","Callus induction; Filamentous callus; Kappaphycus alvarezii; Seaweed; Tissue culture",,,,,,,,"Baweja, P.D., Sahoo, P., Garcia-jimenez, R.R., Seaweed tissue culture as applied to biotechnology: Problems, achievements and prospects (2009) PhycolRes, 57, pp. 45-58; Bradley, P.M., Plant hormones do have a role in controlling growth and development of algae (1991) J Phycol, 27, pp. 317-21; Collantes, G., Melo, C., Candia, A., Micropropagation by explant of Gracilaria chilensis Bird, McLachlan and Oliveira (2004) J Appl Phycol, 16, pp. 203-213; Dawes, C.J., Koch, E.W., Branch micropropagule and tissue culture of the red alga Eucheuma denticulatum and Kappaphycusalvarezii farmed in the Philippines (1991) J Appl Phycol., 6, pp. 21-24; Evan, L.V., Trewavas, A.J., Is algal development controlled by plant growth substances?

Remote sensing technology for seagrass mapping has been used to detect the presence of seagrass coverage, but so far no information on the condition of seagrass could be obtained. Therefore, a research is required using remote sensing imagery to obtain information on the condition of seagrass coverage. The aim of this research is to formulate mathematical relationship between seagrass coverage and depth invariant indices on Quickbird imagery. Transformation was done on multispectral bands which could detect sea floor objects that are in the region of blue, green and red bands. The study areas covered are the seas around Barranglompo Island and Barrangcaddi Island, westward of Makassar city, Indonesia. Various seagrass coverages were detected within the region under study. Mathematical relationship between seagrass coverage and depth invariant indices was obtained by multiple linear regression method. Percentage of seagrass coverage (C) was obtained by transformation of depth invariant indices (Xij) on Quickbird imagery, with transformation equation as follows: C = 19.934 - 63.347 X 12 + 23.239 X 23 .

The objectives of this research were to diagnose diseases occurring on physic nut in Lampung Province and to determine their intensity. Field observation was conducted in four districts: South Lampung, Tanggamus, Bandarlampung, and Tulang Bawang. Disease intensity, whether expressed as disease incidence or severity, was recorded from plant samples determined by making diagonal lines across the field on which five observation spots were made. On each spot, five plant samples were observed. Specimens were also collected and placed individually in plastic bags for laboratory observation. The diseases found on physic nut in Lampung Province were cercospora leaf spot, alternaria leaf spot, fusarium wilt, and bacterial wilt. In addition, leaf malformation first thought to be viral disease was commonly found in many locations. Further mechanical transmission failed to produce similar symptom on tested plants and higher population of mites were found on malformed leaves than that in normal leaves. Based on the disease distribution and intensity, the most likely threatening disease in physic nut cultivation is bacterial wilt. Fusarium also caused wilt, but it was only found in one subdistrict with low incidence. © 2009, Seameo Biotrop.","Alternaria; Bacterial wilt; Cercospora; Fusarium wilt; Jatropha curcas diseases",,,,,,,,"Agrios, G.N., (2005) Plant Pathology, , 5th ed.

A study was carried out on distribution and diversity of Fusarium species associated with two groups of grasses in 10 states throughout Peninsular Malaysia i.e. agricultural grasses (Oryza sativa and Saccharum officinarum) and non-agricultural grasses (Axonopus compressus, Centhotheca lappacea, Chloris barbata, Crysopogon aciculatus, Cyanadon dactylon, Dactyloctenium aegyptium, Digitaria ciliaris, Echinochloa colona, Eleusine indica, Eragrostis amabilis, Eragrostis malayana, Eragrostis uniloides, Ischaemum magnum, Panicum brevifolium, Panicum millaneum, Panicum repens, Paspalum commersonii, Paspalum conjugatum, Paspalum orbiculare, Pennisetum purpureum, Sacciolepis indica, Sporobolus diander and Sporobolus indicus). A total of 474 isolates were single- spored and identified by morphological characteristics. F. semitectum was frequently isolated (23.6%), followed by F. sacchari and F. fujikuroi with 15.4% and 14.6%, respectively. The other nine species were F. solani (10.3%), F. proliferatum (8.9%), F. oxysporum (7.4%), F. subglutinans (6.5%), F. equiseti (5.5%), F. verticillioides (3.4%), F. compactum (2.5%), F. chlamydosporum (1.1%) and F. longipes (0.8%). Based on the Shannon-Weiner Index, F. solani was the highest (H' = 2.62) isolated from grasses. Species of Fusarium from O. sativa were widely diverse with 11 species, followed by non-agricultural grasses with nine species and S. officinarum with only six species.

Vahl. Twenty F. miliacea seeds were surface sown in ten plastic buckets of 18 cm diameter filled with 3 kg soil. After germination only one plant/bucket was retained. Time of first seedling emergence, time and number of leaves appearing until first tiller formation, time of tiller formation, first inflorescence, the first 10 inflorescences appearance and their maturity were recorded for each plant. Plant height and the number of inflorescence per plant was recorded weekly for up to 4 months after sowing. The first ten inflorescences for each plant were tagged after emergence, subsequently mature inflorescences were collected and the numbers of spikelets/inflorescence, seeds/inflorescence, seeds/ plant and 1000 seed weight were determined. Statistical analysis was performed as complete randomized design on weekly observed plant height and inflorescence number using the SAS statistical software and means were tested using Tukey's studentized range test at the 5% level of probability. Fimbristylis miliacea seedlings emerged at 3 days after planting of seeds. Approximate times required for the sequential production of 10 leaves, tillers, first 10 inflorescence and their maturity were 28 days after emergence (DAE), 35 DAE, 49 DAE, 63 DAE, respectively. Plant height increased rapidly from 3-8 WAE and maximum plant height (64.05 cm) was attained at 10 WAE. This species had three important growth stages: a slow growth stage during the first 4 weeks after emergence (WAE); a rapid growth stage from 4-9 WAE; and finally, a maximum growth stage from 9-17 WAE. Within this first 4 weeks after emergence would be the most appropriate time for controlling this species with early post-emergence herbicides. Each F. miliacea plant produced on average of 2.3 tillers/plant and a total of 134 inflorescences, with 84 inflorescences/plant ripening within this period. Each inflorescence comprised 48 spikelets with 511 seeds and matured after 3 weeks of emergence. Total seeds/plant and 1000 seed weight were 42275 and 0.035 g, respectively. Time required for seed ripening was 76 days after emergence. © 2008, Seameo Biotrop.","Development; Fimbristylis miliacea; Growth; Life cycle",,,,,,"Third World Organization for Women in Science, TWOWS

Variations exist in the minimum number of valves to identify, ranging from 100 to 700 valves of the dominant species. This task can be very time consuming, particularly when the diatom valves are not abundant. This research was conducted to determine the minimum number of valves to be identified in the diatom assemblages from Rawapening Lake, Central Java, Indonesia. Based on the 314 samples obtained from Rawapening Lake, the diatom efficiency rose above 0.85 upon the minimum count of 300 valves. The number of diatom species identified remained stable after the minimum of 300 valves. Therefore, the minimum number of diatom's valves identified to represent the assemblage for paleolimnological analysis was 300.","Diatom analysis; Eutrophic; Indonesia; Paleolimnology; Rawapening",,,,,,,,"Bate, N., Newall, P., Techniques for the use of diatoms in water quality assessment: how many valves?

Unpredictable weather conditions and unregulated anthropogenic activities in mangrove area can lead to high turbidity conditions and possibly affect the filtering capacity of P. erosa. This study will aid in the development of culture technique of this species in the region. Results could also be used to facilitate adequate stock management for potential commercial exploitation in Central Philippines. A laboratory experiment was conductedtodetermine the effects of turbidity concentration and body size on the filtration rate and pseudofaeces production of P. erosa. Filtration rates significantly increased with higher turbidity concentration up to 750 mg/L (p < 0.05). Pseudofaeces production also increased with increasing turbidity concentration (p < 0.05). Body size did not affect the filtration and pseudofaeces production of P. erosa. Results suggested that P. erosa was resilient to highly disturbed turbid environments and therefore, could be a potential candidate species for aquaculture.","Biodeposit; Bohol; Nypa; Polymesoda erosa; Pseudofaces production; Silt; Suspension filter-feeders","Bivalvia; Corbiculidae; Erosa; Nypa; Polymesoda; Rhizophoraceae",,,,,,,"Commercially important mangrove bivalves of the Visayas, Philippines: diversity and fishery.

The objective of the experiment was to study effect of plant growth regulators on in vitro propagation, which can be used in cassava micropropagation protocol. Plant materials used were auxiliary shoots of a stem node. The experiment consisted of (i) shoot multiplication, (ii) roots induction, and (iii) acclimatization. The multiple shoot regeneration was observed by using Murashige & Skoog (MS) basal media supplemented with 0, 0.1, 1.0 and 5.0 mg/L of benzylaminopurine (BAP) combined with 0.0, 0.1 and 1.0 mg/L of thidiazuron. The root induction was observed by using 0.1 and 1.0 mg/L of IBA and NAA. The resulting plantlets were transplanted into plastic polybags containing soil mixed with organic fertilizer (1:1) covered with plastic sheets and transferred to a greenhouse. The result of the study showed that the highest number of shoots for Darul Hidayah, Malang-6 and Adira-4 varieties were 4.93 shoots treated with BAP 1 mg/L + thidiazuron 0.1 mg/L, 4.20 shoots at BAP media of 1 mg/L, and 7.20 shoots at the media of BAP 1 mg/L + thidiazuron 0.1 mg/L respectively. The highest number of nodes produced was 2.9 nodes for Darul Hidayah at BAP 5 mg/L, 5.13 nodes for Malang-6 at BAP 0.1 mg/L, and 6.18 nodes for Adira-4 at BAP 5 mg/L+thidiazuron 1 mg/L. The utilization of auxin IAA or NAA could induce and accelerate the growth of roots which finally could increase the success of acclimatization process. With an average of four multiplication factors of each culture period, the potency of each cassava shoot propagated through tissue culture could produce around 37 000 plants/year.","BA; IBA; Manihot esculenta; NAA; Root induction; Shoot multiplication; Thidiazuron","Manihot esculenta",,,,,,,"Davies, P.J., The plant hormones: Their Nature, Occurrence and Function (2004) Plant Hormones Biosynthesis, pp. 1-15. , Davies PJ (Editor), Signal Transduction, Action.

The antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of the exopolysaccharide were also determined. The yield of mycelial biomass of 7.06 g/l, 5.12 g/l, 4.66 g/l, and 2.96 g/l was obtained by utilization of maltose, glucose, lactose and starch as a carbon source, respectively. Furthermore, in the medium containing maltose, lactose, glucose, and starch produce 100.05 mg/l, 97.73 mg/l, 78.63 mg/l, and 70.45 mg/l of exopolysaccharide, respectively. The assay of antimicrobial and antioxidant activity showed that the exopolysaccharide is more active to inhibit the growth of B. subtilis rather than those of E. coli and S. cerevisiae.

The present study aimed to investigate flora diversity, composition, and ecology in Besiq Bermai Forest to support the management of biodiversity and forest conservation. Thirteen plots were established with different sizes of plots (100 m x 20 m plots for trees; 40 m x 5 m plots for saplings; and 5 m x 5 m plots for understory). Data recorded included plant species name and individual number of each plant species. Data analysed were Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Relative Density, Relative Frequency, Relative Dominance and Important Value Index. The principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to determine relationship between edaphic components and flora occurrence. The results showed that there were 93 species of trees (belonging to 48 genera and 22 families), 112 species of saplings (belonging to 62 genera and 43 families), and 48 species of understory (belonging to 28 genera and 20 families). Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') were 6.05, 6.25 and 3.26 for tree, saplings and understory, respectively. The most common family for tree and saplings in the forest ecosystem in this area was Dipterocarpaceae (Shorea spp). Species of tree with the highest importance value index were Dillenia excelsa, Syzygium sp. and Shorea parvifolia. The highest importance value index for species of saplings were Macaranga triloba and Shorea parvifolia; and for species of understory were Phrynium jagorianum. Ecological (edaphic) factors affecting the occurence and establishment of flora in Bermai forest were total N and C/N ratio.

In response to various socio-economic consequences, previous practices on traditional form of shifting cultivation were altered into much sedentary farming practices. Soil productivity to sustain rice yield under current intensified forms of shifting cultivation should be of prime importance for food security among the local community at the marginal uplands of Sarawak. Therefore, this study was conducted to characterize soil properties influenced by the current intensified shifting cultivation practices at Sabal upland area, Sarawak. Along with the use of agrochemicals, shifting cultivation at Sabal area was conducted through single cultivation practices (10 to 15 years of fallow period and a cycle of rice cultivation) and multiple cultivation practices (5 to 7 years of fallow period and two cycles of rice cultivation). Before burning practices, soil pH was highly acidic (ranged from 4.28 to 4.72) in single cultivation sites; while multiple cultivation sites showed less acidic nature (soil pH ranged from 4.98 to 5.23) with relatively high secondary macronutrient contents, especially soil exchangeable Mg and Ca. No significant observation was found after burning practice in Total C and Total N of the soils at both sites. The level of soil exchangeable bases (K, Mg and Ca) and available P increased after the burning practices in single cultivation farmlands; while multiple cultivation sites showed lower to no increase in exchangeable bases and available P, partly attributed to the limited supply of nutrients from the aboveground biomass. After the harvesting of rice, soils at both sites tended to be more acidic and lower in macronutrient contents (K, Mg and Ca), primarily ascribable to crop uptake during the cultivation period. The average yield of rice in single cultivation sites and multiple cultivation sites were 721 kg/ha and 391 kg/ha, respectively. Our findings suggested that the usage of agrochemicals, particularly fertilizers in multiple cultivation sites are necessary for sustaining rice yield to restore the depleted macronutrients (especially K, Mg and Ca) after successive cultivation. © 2018, Seameo Biotrop.","Intensive; Macronutrients; Shifting cultivation; Soil characteristics; Upland rice field; Upland sarawak",,,,,,,,"Andriesse, J.P., Schelhaas, R.M., A monitoring studies on nutrient cycles in soils used for shifting cultivation under various climatic conditions in tropical Asia.

Information about pollen dispersal patterns of D. celebica have not been previously investigated. This study was aimed to determine pollination type, percentage of selfing and outcrossing, as well as distance of pollen dispersal of D. celebica. This study was conducted at experimental forest of Universitas Hasanuddin, Maros District, South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. One hundred and sixty six individuals of D. celebica consisted of adult trees and seedlings were analyzed in this study. Ninety four adult trees were selected to become parent trees. The trees were mapped with GPS coordinates. All samples were genotyped using four SSR markers loci. Parental analysis and determination of pollen dispersal patterns were carried out using Cervus 3.0.3. Results indicated that the evaluated markers were effective for assigning candidate of male parents to all evaluated seedlings. Donated pollens could come from male parents in any directions relative to female parent positions. Pollen dispersal pattern showed outcrossing pollination among different male parents (pollen donated trees). The results indicated that seeds were produced predominatly by outcrossing. Pollen dispersal reached up to 166 m. Pollen related processes were linked through female parents, pollinators availability and ecological environment. Simultaneous use of progeny genotyping, spatially explicit analysis of environmental variables and outcomes of plant-animal interactions were the key elements for an expanded approach to gene flow analysis considering dispersal via pollen and seeds. Research on pollen dispersal of D. celebica should be carried out in other forest types, such as mixed forest and highland forest.","Diospyros celebica Bakh.; Endemic species; Microsatellite marker; Parentage analysis; Pollen dispersal",,,,,,,,"Alrasyid, H., Kajian budidaya pohon Eboni (2002) Berita Biologi [edisi khusus: Manajemen Eboni], 6 (2), pp. 219-225; Asdar, M., Prayitno, T.A., Lukmandaru, G., Faridah, E., Sebaran, potensi dan kualitas kayu Eboni (Diospyros celabica Bakh.) di Sulawesi (2015) J Agroland, 22 (2), pp. 94-105; Austerlitz, F., Dick, C.W., Klein, E.K., Muratorio, S.O., Smouse, P.E., Sork, V.L., Using a genetic markers to estimate the pollen dispersal curve (2004) Mol Ecol, 13, pp. 937-954; Brody, J.R., Kern, S.E., History and principles of conductive media for standard.

Specifically, this farming system provides contribution to carbon sequestration potential of the woody perennials and the biodiversity conservation of the other components of the system. This argument is based on the research conducted in Molawin-Dampalit Sub-Watershed, Mt. Makiling Forest Reserve in the Philippines and Way Betung Watershed in Indonesia. The research involved an interview session of 106 and 261 smallholder farmers and an assessment of 27 and 14 agroforesty plots for carbon stock assessment and biodiversity assessment, respectively. Results indicated that the total carbon found among the crop components was 52.32 MgC/ha in Molawin-Dampalit Sub-Watershed and 244.26 MgC/ha in Way Betung Watershed, which suggested the high carbon sequestration potential of the woody perennials and understory crops in an agroforestry system. The farm lots being cultivated by the smallholder farmers were found to contribute to biodiversity conservation having a moderate biodiversity index of 2.59 and 2.53, respectively. With these findings, promotion of desired agroforestry systems in suitable portions of the watershed areas should be intensified and heightened to contribute to ecological balance across the landscape. Agroforestry should always be an integral part of all initiatives toward ecological restoration with the cultivators/smallholder farmers as potential partners. The agroforestry system should consider all the technical and socioeconomic considerations toward having diverse components and ensure food security among the smallholder farmers throughout the year.","Agroforestry; Biodiversity index; Carbon stock; Molawin-dampalit sub-watershed; Way betung watershed",,,,,,,,"Baguinon, N.T., Lasco, R.D., Macandog, D.M., Pasicolan, P.N., Villancio, V.T., (2007) Agroforestry and land use in the Philippines, p. 236. , Bogor (ID): World Agro-Forestry Centre; Brent, S., Boffa, J.M., Scherr, S.J., (2006) The potentials of agroforestry to contribute to the conservation and enhancement of landscape biodiversity, pp. 95-101. , http://www.worldagroforestry.org/downloads/Publications/PDFS/bc06146.pdf, Chapter 11.

However, information on the initial development of silvofishery ponds concerning the functionality of mangrove seedlings on environmental quality of fish ponds had not been studied. This experiment aimed to determine the environmental conditions of silvofishery ponds and to analyze the effect of seedling stands of mangrove on environmental quality control. The presence of mangrove seedlings caused the decrease of temperature and the increase of salinity. ANOVA showed that mangrove species significantly affected water salinity, while canal width and mangrove species significantly affected turbidity and pH. Regression analysis showed that the height of Rhizophora mucronata had partially significant effect on Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Organic Matter (OM), as well as Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) concentrations. Diameter of R. mucronata affected temperature. The height and diameter of Avicennia marina affected Dissolved Oxygen (DO). Mixed populations of A. marina and R. mucronata had an effect on water turbidity, while population of only A. marina had a partial effect on water salinity.

They are extensively grown in backyards, home gardens, intercroppedwith short termcrops and also in agroforestry system.The potential of bananas to sequester carbon has been reported but there is limited knowledge on the performance of various cultivars. An inventory of biomass and C-stock estimation on banana accessions has been conducted inMusa germplasmplots -PurwodadiBotanicGarden, Pasuruan. Estimation on biomass and C-stock have been conducted for 42 individual banana accessions, comprised 5 wild banana species and 37 cultivars using non-destructive method i.e. allometric equation for banana. The objectives of this study were to conduct inventory on the biomass and C-stock estimation of Indonesian bananas in germplasm collection of Purwodadi Botanic Garden, to make the projections of time average above ground for Cstock of banana farming systemin Indonesia and to discuss the potential role of bananas in land rehabilitation. The results showed that estimation value of biomass andC-stock varied fromone banana accession to another.WildMusa balbisiana species had higher biomass and C-stock value than wildMusa acuminata species. Banana cultivars containing one or two ""B"" genome (ABBandAAB)weremore vigorous and contributed higher biomass and C-stock thanAAA and AA cultivars. Among cultivars, the highest C-stock was contributed by Pisang Kepok Bung (average of 6.92 kg C/plant) whereas the lowest C-stock was contributed by Pisang Rayap (average of 0.67 kg C/plant). In average, various Indonesian bananas studied contributed around 2.26 kg C/plant or 0.98 tonnes C/ha. The growing area of bananas increased from 73,539 ha in 2000 to 101,822 ha in 2010, which was decreased to 100,600 ha in 2014, contributing C-stock around 72.28 tonnes C in 2000 increasing to 100.07 tonnes C in 2010 with a decrease to 98.97 tonnes C in 2014. These numbers are still limited only to the recorded areas. Banana plants in combination with woody tree crops, are potential as important component of agroforestry, home gardens andmixed farming systems to rehabilitate and reforest landscape, to decrease carbon emission in atmosphere in the form of biomass and Cstocks and tomeet the economic needs for local surrounding community. © 2015 Seameo Biotrop.","Banana; Biomass; Carbon stock (C-stock); Estimation; Musa acuminata; Musa balbisiana; Purwodadi BotanicGarden; Rehabilitation",,,,,,,,"Cahyono, B., (1996) Pisang (Budidaja dan Analisis Usaha Tani), p. 80. , Yogyakarta (ID): Kanisius; Daniells, J., Jenny, C., Karamura, D., Tomekpe, K., (2001) Musabgue: a Catalogue of Musa Germplasm, , Diversity in the Genus Musa.

Their successful invasiveness is partly attributed to the ability to accumulate large soil seed banks in the areas that they invade. Seedling emergence and soil seed bank composition were compared under an Acacia mangium plantation and an adjacent tropical heath (kerangas) forest in the Andulau Forest Reserve, BruneiDarussalam. Soil sampleswere collected fromten 20 x 20mplots set up in three contrasting habitats: theAcacia plantation, the adjacent heath forest and the transition zone in between. Soil samples were subjected to smoke and heat treatments, following seedling emergencewhichwas observed daily over a 12-week period. In a parallel investigation, variations in species richness, seed density and seed viability of the soil seed banks of the ten plots were investigated. Seedling emergence was the highest in the plantation and the lowest in the heath forest plots, respectively. However, no significant differences among treatments and no significant treatment-habitat interactions were detected. Species richness, seed density and seed viability in the plantation plots were significantly lower than those in the transition zone and intact heath forest plots. Acacia mangium seeds were not recorded in the heath forest soil seed banks, butwere detected in the plantation and transition zone plots. Lower native plant species richness, seed density and viability in the A. mangium plantation could imply higher regeneration potential for the heath forest habitat if severe habitat destruction was to occur in this forest reserve. It is suggested that proper plantationmanagement practices and closemonitoring of soil seed banks are the best practices that could be adopted tominimize the gradual spread of invasiveAcacias into tropical heath forests of Borneo.","Borneo; Invasive alien plants; Kerangas; Seed extraction; Seed viability; Smoke treatment",,,,,,,,"Ashton, P.M.S., Harris, P.G., Thadani, R., Soil seed bank dynamics in relation to topographic position of a mixed-deciduous forest in southern New England, USA (1998) ForestEcolManag, 111, pp. 15-22; Auld, T.D., Population dynamics of the shrub Acacia suaveolens (Sm.)

Betel leaves (Piperbetle) could be used as repellent material. The study was aimed to test the repellency, potency, and safety of topical lotion repellent of betel and patchouli oil mixture against yellow fever mosquito. This study used nulliparous of 3-5 days old female yellow fever mosquito. Before the study, irritation test was conducted as safety test. Five treatments with five replications was implemented to seek the most effective repellent substance i.e. DEET lotion for positive control, betel leaves and patchouli oil mixture lotion, betel leaves only lotion, patchouli oil only lotion and base lotion only. The substance effectiveness was determined based on the rejection of yellow fever mosquito to bite human's arms and was analyzed using protective percentage. The irritation test showed no safety concerns. Protective percentage analysis showed that modified betel leaves lotion had mean protective power of over 90% for 6 hours. The data showed that the modified lotions had the same protective percentage as the DEET (ratio: PP (betel+patchouli)/PP (DEET) =0.98; 95% confidence interval 0.93, 1.04; p-value=0.50). This indicated that betel leaves mixed with patchouli oil is potential to be used as safe repellent against yellow fever mosquito.","Aedes aegypti; Betel leaves; DHF; Formulations; Lotion; Repellent; Yellow fever mosquito","Aedes aegypti; Dengue virus; Piper betel; Pogostemon; Pogostemon cablin",,,,,,,"Bhalerao, S.A., Verma, D.R., Gavankar, R.V., Teli, M.C., Rane, Y.Y., Drawana, V.S., Tri Kanned, A., Phytochemistry, pharmacological profile and therapeutic uses of Piper betle Linn.

The tolerant species are more adaptive to waterlogged condition. The documented effects of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) inoculation on wetland plant performance are inconsistent. Besides increasing the tolerance of plants, AMF also causes plants depression in waterlogged condition. This study was carried out to examine the morphoanatomical adaptation, survival, growth, biomass and nutrient uptake of lonkida (Nauclea orientalis L.) from different habitats inoculated with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) in waterlogged condition for 90 days. Experiment procedures included: seed germination, preparation of inoculums and inoculation of AMF and waterlogged treatment. The results showed that lonkida seedlings formed lenticels (100%), adventitious roots (41%) and aerenchym under waterlogged condition. Seedlings from dry land habitats, both mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal, had lower height growth rate than those from other habitat types. The same results happened for relative growth rates for shoot (RGRs), root (RGRr) and total (RGRt) dry weight and the ratio of root shoots. Treatments of temporal swamp habitat without waterlogged condition and with waterlogged condition and treatment in savannah with waterlogged condition had RGRt greater than those in other treatments. In general, plant dry weight (root, shoot and total) and total N in roots and shoots were greater in the interaction between temporal swamp habitat with nonmycorrhizal in waterlogged condition. However, lonkida seedling from dry land habitat required AMF under waterlogged condition to improve biomass and N accumulation in roots. Independently, waterlogged condition increased the pool of average height gain (18%), diameter (46%), leaf area (40%), leaf length (17%) and leaf width (21%). Nonetheless, waterlogged condition treatment decreased the number of leaves (9%) and AMF colonization (71%). The results of this study indicated that seedlings from temporal swamp had good growth and high biomass in condition with or without waterlogged condition.","Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF); Lonkida; Morpho-anatomical adaptations; Nauclea orientalis; Swamp; Waterlogged condition","Fungi; Nauclea orientalis",,,,,,,"Amihan-Vega, B., Mendoza, J.D., Benefits from tree growing In the degraded uplands: empirical realities from Tabango, Leyte, the Philippines (2005) ACIAR Smal lho lder Forestry Project-Redevelopment of a Timber Industry Following Extensive Land Clearing : from Proceedings The End-of-Project Workshop, 19-21, pp. 93-106. , Harrison S, Herbohn J, Suh J, Mangaoang E,Vanclay J,editors, Ormoc city, The Philipines, August 2004; Ashraf, M.A., Waterlogging stress in plants : a review (2012) Afr J Agric Res., 7 (13), pp. 1976-1981; Petunjuk Teknis Analisis Kimia Tanah, Tanaman, Air dan Pupuk.

A total of 28 samples including 16 ITS sequences from GeneBank were used. Species of Ensete and Musella were incorporated as an outgroup. Total DNA was extracted by modified CTAB. ITS-5 and ITS-4 primers were used to amplify the ITS regions. Data sequences were edited by ChromasPro and were aligned by Muscle software. Some unique nucleotides were found in M. balbisiana M. itinerans and M. textilis sequences. Strict consensus tree revealed from Maximum Parsimony (MP) as well as Bayesian analysis showed Musa textilis was separated from other taxa in which M. textilis became the basal sister to M. balbisiana. By using MP analysis, M. itinerans together with M. acuminata ssp. banksii M. acuminata var. tomentosa and M. celebica were placed in the same clade, whereas Bayesian analysis showed M. was separated and placed in different clade.","Bayesian; ITS; Maximum parsimony; Musa; Phylogenetic; Sulawesi",,,,,,,,"Alvares, I., Wendel, J.F., Ribosomal ITS sequences and plant phylogenetic inference (2003) Mol Phylo Evol, 29, pp. 417-434; Baldwin, B.G., Sanderson, M.J., Porter, J.M., Wojciecholoski, M.F., Campbell, C.S.D., The ITS region of nuclear ribosomal DNA: a valuable sources of evidence on angiospermae phylogeny (1995) Ann Missouri Bot Gard, 82, pp. 247-277; Cheesman, E.E., Classification of the bananas I: the genus Musa L (1947) Kew Bull, 2, pp. 106-117; Daniells, J., Jenni, C., Karamura, D., Tomelpe, K., (2001) Musalogue: A Catalogue of Musa Germplasm, Diversity in The Genus Musa, , Montpellier: INIBAP; Doyle, J.J., Doyle, J.L., A rapid DNA isolation procedure for small quantities of fresh leaf tissue (1987) Phyto chem Bull, 19, pp. 11-15; Edgar, R.C., Muscle: multiple sequence aligment with high accuracy and high throughput (1994) Nucleic Acids Research, 32 (5), pp. 1792-1797; Gawel, N.J., Jarret, R.L., Chloroplast DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) in Musa species (1991) Theor Appl Genet, 81, pp. 783-786; Häkkinen, M., Typification and check-list of Musa L. names (Musaceae) with nomenclatural notes (2008) Adansonia sér 3, 30 (1), pp. 63-112; Holder, M., Lewis, P.O., Phylogeny estimation: traditional and Bayesian approaches (2003) Nature, 4, pp. 276-284; Hřibová, E., Ćžková, J., Christelová, P., Taudin, S., de Langhe, E., Doleźel, J., The ITS1-5. 8S-ITS2 sequeίnce region in the Musaceae: structure, diversity and use in molecular phylogeny (2011) PLoS ONE, 6 (3), pp. e17863. , doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0017863; Kress, W.J., Prince, L.M., Williams, K.J., The phylogeny and a new classification of the gingers (Zingiberaceae): evidence from molecular data (2002) Am J Bot, 89, pp. 1682-1696; Li, L.F., Häkkinen, M., Yuan, Y.M., Hao, G., Ge, X.Y., Molecular phylogeny and systematics of the banana family (Musaceae) offered from multiple nuclear and chloroplast DNA fragments, with a special reference to the genus Musa (2010) Mol Phylo Evol, 57, pp. 1-10; Li, D.Z., Gao, L.M., Li, H.T., Wang, H., Ge, X.J., Liu, J.Q., Chen, Z.D., Duan, G.W., Comparative analysis of a large dataset indicates that internal transcribe spacer (ITS) should be incorporated into the core barcode for seed plants (2011) Proc.

Patterns of genetic diversity and population genetic structure of adults and saplings in two extant populations (Kali Jati and Solok Besek) were estimated using ten microsatellite markers. A total of 39 alleles were found, with two and four alleles being unique in adult and sapling populations, respectively. Allelic richness and heterozygosity were similar between adult (Ar = 3.00; = He 0.423) and sapling (Ar= 3.25; He = 0.441) populations. Inbreeding coefficients in saplings were positive in both populations and statistically significant in Kali Jati, while those in adult populations were not significantly different from zero, indicating excessive inbreeding and selfing in the sapling populations. Genetic differentiation of the sapling populations (FST= 0.036) was slightly lower than in the adult populations (0.050), but only significantly so for saplings. This study revealed that D. littoralis has low genetic diversity in both adults and saplings. Similarly low values in allele richness and heterozygosity suggest that reductions of population size have been ongoing for long periods in this species. Significant genetic differentiation between sapling populations but not adult populations indicates that recent fragmentation is further accelerating the isolation process.","Dipterocarpus littoralis; Genetic differentiation; Genetic diversity; Microsatellite",,,,,,,,"Abdiyani, S., Evaluation of vegetation diversity in the reforestation program in Nusakambangan Island (2008) Info Hutan V-3, pp. 209-217; Alvarez-Buylla, E.R., Chaos, A., Pinero, D., Garay, A.A., Demographic genetics of a pioneer tree species: patch dynamics, seed dispersal, and seed banks (1996) Evolution, 50 (3), pp. 1155-1166; Ashton, P.S., Dipterocarpaceae (1982) Flora MalesianaI-9, pp. 237-552; Cascante, A., Quesada, M., Lobo, J.A., Fuchs, E.J., Effects of dry tropical forest fragmentation on the reproductive success and genetic structure of the tree Samanea saman (2002) Conservation Biology, 16 (1), pp. 137-147; Chan, H.T., Appanah, S., Reproductive biology of some Malaysian dipterocarps (1980) Malaysian Forester, 44, pp. 28-36; Chung, M.Y., Nason, J.D., Epperson, B.K., Chung, M.G., Temporal aspects of the fine-scale genetic structure in a population of Cinnamomum insularimontanum (Lauraceae) (2003) Heredity, 90 (1), pp. 98-106; Dick, C.W., Etchelecu, G., Austerlitz, F., Pollen dispersal of tropical trees (Dinizia excels: Fabaceae) by native insects and African honeybees in pristine and fragmented Amazonian rainforest (2003) Molecular Ecology, 12, pp. 753-764; Didham, R.K., Ghazoul, J., Stork, N.E., Davis, A.J., Insects in fragmented forests: a functional approach (1996) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 11, pp. 255-260; Doyle, J.J., Doyle, J.L., Isolation of plant DNA from fresh tissue (1990) Focus, 12, pp. 13-15; Ellstrand, N.C., Elam, D.R., Population genetic consequences of small population size: Implications for plant conservation (1993) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 24, pp. 217-242; Excoffier, L., Lischer, H.E.L., Arlequin suite ver. 3. 5: Anew series of programs to perform population genetics analyses under Linux and Window (2010) Molecular Ecology Resources, 10, pp. 564-567; Falk, D.A., Holsinger, K.E., (1991) Genetics and Conservation of Rare Plants, , Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Farwig, N., Braun, C., Böhning-Gaese, K., Human disturbance reduces genetic diversity of an endangered tropical tree, Prunus africana (Rosaceae) (2008) Conservation Genetics, 9, pp. 317-326; Finger, A., Kettle, C.J., Kaiser-Bunbury, C.N., Valentin, T., Mougal, J., Ghazoul, J., Forest fragmentation genetics in a formerly widespread island endemic tree: Vateriopsis seychellarum (Dipterocarpaceae) (2012) Molecular Ecology, 21 (10), pp. 2369-2382; Fukue, Y., Kado, T., Lee, S.L., Ng, K.K.S., Muhammad, N., Tsumura, Y., Effects of flowering tree density on the mating system and gene flow in Shorea kprosula (Dipterocarpaceae) in Peninsular Malaysia (2007) Journal of Plant Research, 120 (3), pp. 413-420; Furches, M.S., Wallace, L.E., Helenurm, K., High genetic divergence characterizes populations of the endemic plant lithophragma maximum (Saxifragaceae) on San Clemente Island (2009) Conservation Genetics, 10, pp. 115-126; Gitzendanner, M.A., Soltis, P.S., Patterns of genetic variation in rare and endangered widespread plant congeners (2000) American Journal of Botany, 87 (6), pp. 783-792; Godt, M.J.W., Hamrick, J.L., Allozyme diversity in the endangered pitcher plant Sarracenia rubra ssp. alabamensis (Sarraceniaceae) and its close relative ssp.

Specific information about genetic parameter of resin yielder candidates in Cijambu Seedling Seed Orchard is still not determined yet, although based on resin distribution trend this SSO has the highest mean of resin production. In this research, individual and family heritability, coefficient genetic variation and genetic-phenotypic correlation were estimated for resin production and growth data from 15 open polinated families of Pinus merkusii planted in 1982 (set 1) -1983 (set 2) in Cijambu SSO. The results showed high value of coefficient genetic variation (CVG: 14.5-28.43%), individual narrow sense heritability values for resin production character (0.58-0.77) which resemble with previous researches. This indicates that genetic factor was dominant for resin production and selection activities were effective to get high yielder superior candidate. Phenotypic and genotypic correlation found that bark thickness, crown length and stem diameter character was positively significant correlated to resin production, whereas severity attack level of pests-diseases and number of branches were negatively significant correlated to resin production.","Heritability; High resin yielder; P. merkusii; Phenotypic; Selection; Variation",,,,,,,,"Baliuckas, V.T., Lagerstrom, I., Norell, N., Eriksson, G., Genetic variation among and within populations in Swedish species of SorbusaucupariaL. and PrunuspadusL. assessed in a nursery trial (2005) Silvae Genetica, 54, pp. 1-8; Bastein, C., Alia, R., (2000) What Might be useful Measures of Genetic Variability for Adaptive Characters within Populations of Scots Pine., , Invest.

A total of 129 samples of processed peanut products were collected. The products consisted of roasted nut-in shell peanuts (33 samples), flour-coated peanut kernels (33), siomay sauce (18),pecel/gado-gado sauce (33) and satai sauce (12). Sample size varied from 2000 g for roasted nut-in shell peanuts and flour-coated peanut kernels, to 1500 g for siomay sauce,pecel/gado-gado sauce as well as satai sauce samples. The samples were mixed homogeneously. It was then divided into two parts manually, and then each part was also divided into two parts to obtain working samples to determine A. flavus population, AFB1 content and a reserve sample. Kernels of roasted nut-in shell peanuts and flour-coated peanut kernels were obtained by shelling their skin pods and removing the seed coat and the batter coat of tapioca flour manually, respectively. Aspergillusflavus in peanut processed products was isolated using a serial dilution method, followed by pour plate method on Aspergillus Flavus and Parasiticus Agar (AFPA). AFB1 content was determined using Thin Layer Chromatography method. Two replicates were used for each sample.The results showed that the population of A. flavus in roasted nut- in shell peanuts, flour-coated peanut kernels, siomay sauce,pecel/gado-gado sauce and satai sauce were 0.3,0.1,0.3,13.2 and 0.4 cfu/g (wet basis), respectively. The highest AFB1 content of 43.2 ppb was found in roasted peanut nut-in shell, followed by flour-coated peanut kernels (34.3 ppb), satai sauce (23.2 ppb),pecel/gado-gado sauce (17.1 ppb) and siomay sauce (4.4 ppb).","Aflatoxin B1; Aspergillusflavus; Municipality of bogor; Processed peanut products",,,,,,,,"(2005) Official Methods of Analysisof AOACInternational., p. 11. , [AOAC] Association of Official Analytical Chemist.

In this study, the occurrence of arboreal-climbing grapsids and other brachyurans associated with the mangals of Quezon and Catanduanes was considered including some aspects on climbing, burrowing and feeding behaviour of selected grapsids represented by Hemigrapsus, Pseudograpsus and Metopograpsus. The non-grapsoid taxa are represented by Varunidae ( Ptychognathus), Portunidae (Charybdis Portunus Scylla Thalamita); and Eriphiidae (Epixanthus ).Metopograpsus latifrons (White 1847) [Grapsus ] is an exclusive mangrove tree climber (EMTC), while Pseudograpsus elongatus (A. Milne Edwards 1873) is described here as occasional mangrove tree climber (OMTC).Hemigrapsus (Hemigrapsus) penicillatus (De Haan 1835)[Grapsus (Eriocheir)] is a non-mangrove arborealclimbing species (NTC) only seen on crevices of the mangrove areas. P. elongatus creates burrows most often than M. latifrons Likewise, the study provides information on the presence of the portunid orange mud crab (Scylla olivacea ); the green mud crab (S. paramamosain ); the varunid (Ptychognathus altimana ); and extremely abundant xanthiid crab, Epixanthus dentatus in the mangroves of Catanduanes but not in Pagbilao, Quezon.","Brachyurans; Grapsid crabs; Mangroves; Philippines",,,,,,,,"Ashton, E.C., Mangrove sesarmid crab feeding experiments in Peninsular Malaysia (2002) Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 273, p. 97119; Banaag, J.F., Vegetational composition and association in a mangrove forest ecosystem in Puerto Galera, Oriental Mindoro (1972) Natural and Applied Science Bulletin, 29 (1-2), pp. 1-40; Cannicci, S., Burrows, D., Fratini, S., Smith, T.J., Offenberg, J., Dahdouh-Guebas, F., Faunal impact on vegetation structure and ecosystem function in mangrove forests: a review (2008) Aquatic Botany, 89 (2), pp. 186-200; Chen, G.C., Ye, Y., Changes in properties of mangrove sediment due to foraging on Kandelia obovata leaves by crabs Parasersarmaplicatum (Gzapsidae: Sesarminae) (2010) Marine Ecology Progress Series.; Dahdouh-Guebas, F., Giuggioli, M., Oluoch, A., Vannini, A., Cannicci, S., Feeding habits of non-ocypodid crabs from two mangrove forests in Kenya.64:291297 (1999) Bulletin of Marine Science, 64, p. 291297; Dolar, M.L.L., A survey on the fish and crustacean fauna of the seagrass beds in North Bais Bay, Negros Oriental, Philippines (1991) Proceedings of the Regional Symposium on Living Resources inIn Coastal Areas., pp. 367-377. , Quezon City: University of the Philippines marine Science Institute; Dolar, M.L.D., Alcala, A.C., Nuique, J., A survey on the fish and crustaceans of the mangroves of the North Bais Bay, Philippines (1991) Proceedings of the Regional Symposium on Living Resources in Coastal Areas, pp. 513-519. , Alcala, A.C.

The objectives of this study were to determine the contents of AFB1 in processed peanut products at retail levels, and to obtain information whether there is a risk to public health caused by the consumption of processed peanut products contaminated by AFB1. Survey of processed peanut product consumption was carried out by interviewing each respondent using a questionnaire of weekly processed peanut product consumption. Sampling of processed peanut products was conducted at the locations where the respondents obtained processed peanut products. The number of roasted peanuts with skin pods, flour-coated peanuts and pecel or gado-gado sauces samples was 33, respectively, while the number of siomay and satai sauces samples was 18 and 12, respectively. The total number of processed peanut product sampleswas 129. AFB1contentwas determined using Thin Layer Chromatography method. Estimation of the dietary exposure assessmentwas determined using the actual survey data consisting of AFB1 content, consumption data and body weight. The highest contaminated sample percentage and mean of AFB1 content was found in roasted peanuts with skin pods i.e. 42% of 33 samples and 43.2 μg/kg, respectively, followed by flour-coated peanuts (30% of 33 samples and 34.3 μg/kg), and pecel or gado-gado (21% of 33 samples and 17.1 μg/kg). Mean of estimated dietary exposure for AFB1 found in children was 15.2 ng kg -1 bw day -1 and 95 th percentile exposure was 38.9 ng kg -1 bw day -1 , while in adults 9.0 ng kg -1 bw day -1 and 95 th percentile exposure was 27.0 ng kg -1 bw day -1 . The excess cancer risk of AFB1 exposure in Bogor from this study on children and adults was calculated as 193 and 115 cancers/year, respectively.","Aflatoxin B 1; Dietary exposure assessment; Processed peanut products","Arachis hypogaea",,,,,,,"Natural toxins (2005) Official methods of Analysis of AOAC International, p. 11. , AOAC, Horwitz W, editor., Association of Official Analytical Chemist, Gaithersburg. 18 th ed.

In this experiment, delignified corncob, its cellulose fraction and alpha cellulose were used as substrates to produce fermentable sugar by using three local isolates of celluloytic bacteria (C5-1, C4-4, Cll-1 and Cmix; mixed cultures of three isolates), and Saccharomyces cereviseae to produce ethanol. The results showed that all isolates of cellulolytic bacteria can grow on cellulose fraction better than on delignified corncob and alpha cellulose.

Ethanol can be produced by mixed culture of bacteria and yeast, but because of competitive growth, the fermentation only produced 0.39-0.47 g/1 of ethanol.","Celluloses; Delignified corncob","Bacteria (microorganisms); Saccharomyces",,,,,,,"Daisy, P., (1984) Official Methods Analysis The Association of Official Analytical Chemist, , AOAC. 14* ed.

(Thymelaeaceae) is the most valuable non wood production of forestry plant in Indonesia. It produces a fragrant resin when subjected to fungal attack and has been traded internationally known as gaharu. Knowledge of genetic diversity and relationship among species and genus is important for breeding purposes and species conservation. In this study, genetic variability of six Aquilaria species were analyzed using the AmplifiedFragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Ten AFLP primer combinations amplified 1353 DNA fragments ranging in size from100 to 350 bp of which 1285 (95%) of them were polymorphic. Genetic similarities among Aquilaria sp. consisted of A. malaccensis, A. beccariana, A. microcarpa, and A. crassna ranged from 63.90 to 72.00 % based on Dice coefficient. The dendrogram derived by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean of germplasm analysis were clustered into two main groups. Hence, a genetic variation among species is quiet high. Bootstrap values for the groups supported 70% of the cluster using a linear relationship equation of (r = 0.724, P < 0.0001) was observed between known pedigrees and AFLP-derived genetic similarity for 136 pairwise comparisons of Aquilaria species. For example, A. malacensis and A. microcarpa have the highest genetic similarity (72.00%) compared with another Aquilaria species. Primer pairs E-ACG/M-CTA produced a specific fragment for A. beccariana (850 bp), A. crasna (550 bp, 180 bp, and 140 bp), A. malaccencis (1500 bp), A. microcarpa (250 bp) and Gyrinops versteegii (150 bp). Primer pairs E-ACG/M-CAA produced a specific DNA fragment only for A. beccariana (1500 bp and 100 bp). Primer pairs E-ACC/M-CAC also produced only specific fragment for A. crassna (1500 bp). Study showed the usefulness of AFLP analysis in Aquilaria sp. and its potential application for breeding and species conservation. Further, molecular diversity estimated in the present study combined with the datasets on other morphological/agronomic traits will be useful for selecting the appropriate accessions for plant improvement through conventional and molecular breeding approaches. © 2009, Seameo Biotrop.","Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP); Aquilaria sp.; Gaharu; Genetic diversity; Gyrinops sp.; Molecular marker",,,,,,,,"Barden, A., Anak, N.A., Mulliken, T., Song, M., (2000) Hearth of the matter: agarwood use and trade and CITES implementation for Aquilaria malaccensis a Traffic Network Report, , Cambridge: Traffic International; Eurlings, M.C.M., Granvendeel, B., Trn-T-trn-F sequence data imply paraphyly of Aquilaria and Gyrinops (Thymelecaea) and provide new prospectves for agarwood identification (2005) Plant systematics and evolution, 254, pp. 1-121; Ergul, A., Kazan, K., Aras, S., Hevik, V., Celik, H., Soylemezolu, G., AFLP analysis of genetic variation within the two economically important Anatolian grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) varietal groups (2006) Genome, 49, pp. 467-475; Hou, D., Thymelaeaceae (1960) Flora Malesiana, 1, pp. 1-48. , In: Van Steenis C.G.G.J.

The loss of human lives due to the deadly tsunamis in East Asia and the unabated destruction of coastal vegetation have resulted in a renewed focus on the mangrove resources. The purpose of this paper is to report the existing mangrove database of the typhoon-prone island province of Catanduanes in Luzon, Philippines which will be used as bases in determining the appropriate educational management initiatives of various sectors for mangrove rehabilitation and regeneration. A total of 37 species of mangrove vascular flora (13 species of major mangrove elements, 10 species of minor mangrove elements and 14 associated mangrove species) were identified in the island under study. Two species of the genus Avicennia (A. marina and A. officinalis) were noted in the island. The other genera (Bruguiera, Ceriops, Sonneratia and Rhizophora) are well distributed in the designated eco-zones. Nypa fruticans is the most important mangrove plant species and a member of the screwpine family (Pandanaceae), Pandanus tectorius which is an associated mangrove species is well-distributed all throughout the island. © 2008, Seameo Biotrop.","Catanduanes; Mangroves; Occurrence and distribution; Philippines; Vascular flora",,,,,,,,"Babaran, R.P., Ingles, J.A., Philippine marine coastal habitats at risk: a case study of Guimaras island (1997) Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanology, , University of the Philippines in the Visayas Institute of Integrative and Development Studies-Marine Affairs Program, UP Press; Barth, H., The biogeography of mangroves (1982) Tasks for Vegetation Science: Contributions to the Ecology of Halophytes, , In: D.N.

Based on isozyme analysis using two enzyme markers such as esterase (EST) and acid phosphatase (ACP) showed that 3 putative mutants (PO-3, PO-4 and PO-5) among 5 mutants are positive. Even though the isozyme patterns indicated that those 3 putative mutants are positively mutated, only PO-5 showed higher productivity compared to control (PO-K) which is reflected by significantly higher number of fruit bodies, higher fresh weight and dry weight yield of three successive flush periods. It was assumed that the mutation which occurred in PO-3 and PO-4 may affect other trait(s) of the white oyster mushroom.

Meristem culture of ginger through somatic embryogenesis could be a potential method for producing pathogen-free planting materials. Somatic embryogenesis on ginger was performed to obtain vigorous plantlets having the same rhizome size as the mother plant. Callus was induced from meristem tissue of inner bud of Indonesian ginger rhizome Var. Cimanggu-1 and consecutively subcultured into certain media at each steps of experiments. The vigorous embryogenic calli were observed on MS medium containing 100 mgl -1 glutamine and 2% sucrose with addition of 1.0 mgl -1 2,4-D + 3.0 mgl -1 BA. The highest number of somatic embryos (about 82.0.g-1 friable calli) was achieved on that medium, 4 weeks after culturing. Furthermore, the optimum growth of embryogenic calli containing somatic embryo was obtained on MS medium enriched with 6% sucrose. The highest number of mature somatic embryos (57.2 embryos) was achieved on MS medium, 18 days after incubation. The regeneration potency of somatic embryos obtained from ginger meristem was 51.20%.g-1 friable callus. The valuable result of this study was the achievement of normal rhizome size of regenerated plantlets, instead of micro rhizome. © 2008, Seameo Biotrop.","Meristem culture; Somatic embryogenesis; Zingiber officinale Rosc.",,,,,,,,"Adkins, S.W., Adkins, A.L., Ramage, C.M., Williams, R.R., In vitro ecology: Modification of headspace and medium conditions can optimize tissue and plant development (2002) The importance of plant tissue culture and biotechnology in plant sciences, pp. 55-77. , In: Taji A, R.

The latter mentioned is one of the target molecules for anticancer drug. The antibacterial activity was examined using disc diffusion assay against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus mutans. The antioxidant activity was measured using superoxide radical scavenging activityassay. Topoisomerase-Inhibitor activity was determined using the method reported by TopoGEN. The chloroform extract did not show antibacterial activity and it has low antioxidant activity (48.5%). The ethyl acetate and methanol extracts positively inhibited the growth of target bacteria at concentration of 0.3-mg/paper disk. It also showed high antioxidant activity. At concentration of 250 μg/ml both extracts were able to scavenge superoxide free radicals which was 94.8% and 83.4% for ethyl acetate and methanol extract, respectively. The methanol extract also inhibited topoisomerase-I activity at concentration of 7.5 μg/ml. The results suggest that there is a correlation between antibacterial, antioxidant and topoisomerase-I inhibitor activity. The stem bark extracts contain biologically active compounds that could be potential for nutraceutical or pharmaceutical development. © 2017 BIOTROPIA - The Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Biology.","Antibacterial; Antioxidant; Ethnomedicinal plant; Pemphis acidula; Topoisomerase-I inhibitor",,,,,,,,"Anderson, R.A., Broadhurst, C.L., Polansky, M.M., Schmidt, W.F., Khan, A., Flanagan, V.P., Schoene, N.W., Graves, D.J., Isolation and characterization of polyphenol type-a polymers from cinnamon with insulin-like biological activity (2004) J.

Interviews using questionnaires, with farmers, collectors and retailers concerning pre- and post-harvest handling of peanuts were carried out. The moisture contents and physical quality of the peanut kernels were also determined. During the wet and dry seasons, fresh pod samples were collected from farmer fields (24 samples), dry raw pod samples from collector (24 samples) and raw kernel samples from retailer levels (54 samples). Thus, during each season 102 samples of various kinds of peanuts were collected for analysis. The A. flavus infection in kernel samples of peanuts collected from retailers were the highest, followed by samples collected from collectors and farmers. The A. flavus infection in kernel samples collected during the dry season was in general lower than in the wet season. It was alarming to note that all most all samples of raw kernel samples collected from retailers were infected by A. flavus during the wet and dry seasons. In general aflatoxin B1 levels in peanut samples collected in the wet season were higher than the dry season. During the wet and dry seasons, the aflatoxin B1 contents in retailer samples were the highest, followed by those collected from collectors and farmers. During the wet season, around 4, 17 and 33% of peanut samples collected from farmers, collectors and retailers, were respectively contaminated with more than 15 ppb of aflatoxin B1. During the dry season, around 42 and 74% of peanut samples collected from collectors and retailers, were respectively contaminated with more than 15 ppb of aflatoxin B1, while aflatoxin levels in wet raw pod samples collected from farmers were less than 15 ppb. In 2003 Codex Alimentarius Commission has determined a maximum level of total aflatoxins in peanuts intended for further processing at 15 ppb. © 2017 BIOTROPIA - The Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Biology.","Aflatoxin; Aspergillus flavus; Peanuts; Wonogiri regency",,,,,,,,"(1995) Oilseeds-Determination of Moisture and Volatile Matter Content, , British Standard International.

It is the difference between the total carbon uptake from the air through photosynthesis and the carbon loss due to respiration by living plants. However, field measurements of NPP are time-consuming and expensive. Current techniques are therefore not useful for obtaining NPP estimates over large areas. By combining the remote sensing and GIS technology and modelling, we can estimate NPP of a large ecosystem with a little ease. This paper discusses the use of a process based physiological sunshade canopy models in estimating NPP of Lore Lindu National Park (LLNP). The discussion includes on how to parameterize the models and how to scale up from leaf to the canopy. The version documented in this manuscript is called NetPro Model, which is a potential NPP model where water effect is not included yet. The model integrates CIS and the use of Remote Sensing, and written in Visual Basic 6.0 programming language and Map Objects 2.1. NetPro has the capability of estimating NPP of Cs vegetation under present environmental condition and under future scenarios (increasing [CO 2 ], increasing temperature and increasing or decreasing leaf nitrogen level). Based on site-measured parameterisation of V aM * (Photosynthetic capacity), /Jj (Respiration) and leaf nitrogen ONi), the model was run under increasing CO 2 level and temperature and varied leaf nitrogen. The output of the semi-mechanistic modelling is radiation use efficiency (?). Analysis of remote sensing data give Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and related Leaf Area Index (LAI) and traction of absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (/M &gt; AK). Climate data are obtained from 12 meteorological stations around die parks, which includes global radiations, minimum and maximum temperature. CO2 absorbed by vegetation (Gross Primary Production, GPP) is then calculated using the above variables and parameters with the following equation. estimating NPP, while ecosystem respiration is set as a function of temperature for estimating NEE. Under present condition, the net absorption of CO &gt; by the vegetation of Lore Lindu National Park (NPP) is 1330.31 gCm""2year""' and at double CO 2 and temperature increased of 3.5 ""C, it increased by 23 %, reaching 1638.80 gCm' 2 year' 1 . © 2006, Seameo Biotrop.","Carbon sequestration; Net primary-production; NPP Semi-mechanistic model; Photosynthesis; Tropical forest",,,,,,,,"Anten, N.P.R., Schieving, F., Werger, M.J.A., Patterns of light and nitrogen distribution in relation to whole canopy carbon gain in C3 and C4 mono-and dicotyledonous species (1995) Oecologia, 101, pp. 504-513; Bernacchi, C.J., Singsaas, E.L., Pimentel, C., Portis, A.R., Long, S.P., Improved temperature response functions for models of Rubisco-limited photosynthesis (2001) Plant Cell and Environ, 24, pp. 253-259; Churkina, G., Running, S.W., Schloss, A.L., Comparing global models of terrestrial net primary productivity: the importance of water availability (1999) Global Change Biol, 5, pp. 46-55; De Pury, D.G.G., Farquhar, G.D., Simple scaling of photosynthesis from leaves to canopies without the errors of big-leaf models (1997) Plant Cell and Environ, 20, pp. 537-557; Dixon, R.K., Brown, S., Houghton, R.A., Solomon, A.M., Trexler, M.C., Wisniewski, J., Carbon pools and flux of global forest ecosystems (1994) Science, 263, pp. 185-190; Farquhar, G.D., von Caemmerer, S., Modelling of photosynthetic responses to environmental conditions.

Nevertheless, there have been lack of reports about the availability of non-pathogenic, lipase producing bacteria, which could naturally degrade glycerol produced from the lipolysis process by lipase. This study reported a newly identified species of rhizobacteria, Alcaligenes javaensis JG3, which is not only able to produce high level of lipase, but also able to degrade glycerol molecules. Identification of strain JG3 was carried out using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope), BD Phoenix 100 Automated Microbiology System and 16S rRNA gene analysis to determine its taxonomy status. The ability of the strain to metabolize glycerol was investigated both genotypically and phenotypically using degenerate PCR and a glycerol minimal medium. Identification test results showed that strain JG3 belongs to genus Alcaligenes, with the closest relationship with A. faecalis and A. aquatilis (96% nucleotide similarity maximum). Degenerate PCR resulted in a 248-bp sequence showing 93% similarity with glpK of Candidatus Sodalis pierantonius SOPE, a key gene involved in glycerol metabolism. In vitro glycerol utilization test result showed that Alcaligenes sp. JG3 was able to grow on glycerol aerobically, but not anaerobically. It is concluded that Alcaligenes sp. JG3 possesses genes coding for glycerol metabolism and this trait is phenotypically expressed, thus making the strain potential to be used as an effective fat and oil biodegrader. © 2018, Seameo Biotrop.","Alcaligenes; Biodegradation; Degenerate PCR; Glpk; Glycerol metabolism",,,,,,,,"Allen, M.E., (2005) MacConkey agar plates protocol, pp. 1-4. , Washington (US): American Society for Microbiology; Altschul, S.F., Madden, T.L., Schäffer, A.A., Zhang, J., Zhang, Z., Miller, W., Lipman, D.J., Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: A new generation of protein database search programs (1997) Nucleic Acids Res., 25, pp. 3389-3402; Chaerun, S.K., Hasni, S., Sanwani, E., Moeis, M.R., Mercury (Hg)-resistant bacteria in Hg-polluted gold mine sites of Bandung West Java Province (2012) Indonesia Microbiol, 6, pp. 57-68; Charulatha, R., Prabhakar, S., Sivamani, P., Kandeepan, C., Tiagarajan, V., Characterization of clinical application of extrace llularlipase by microorganisms from soil (2012) Int J Curr Sci, 3, pp. 61-66; Drancourt, M., Bollet, C., Carlioz, A., Martelin, R., Gayral, J.P., Raoult, D., 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis of a large collection of environmental and clinical unidentifiable bacterial isolates (2000) J Clin Microbiol, 38, pp. 3623-3630; Ethica, S.N., Hammi, M.K., Lestari, P., Semiarti, E., Widada, J., Raharjo, T.J., Amplification of Azospirillum sp.

Cilacap coastal area has high risk on oil pollution. This study investigated the stimulatory effect of nitrogen concentration, bacterial density and the composition of bacterial culture in enhancing oil degradation in this area. The applications of 4 different concentrations of Slow Release Fertilizer (SRF) and 2 different densities of bacterial cells in the form of single (RCO/B/08_008) and mixed culture were employed in microcosm experiments for 28 days. The efficacy of combining bacterial culture and fertilizer application in various concentrations was also tested. Oil degradation, bacterial growth and environmental parameters were monitored periodically during the experiments. The results showed that oil degradation rate was more influenced by nutrient concentration (biostimulation) than bacterial number or culture composition (bioaugmentation) added. The efficacy of biostimulation in degrading oil was better than that of bioaugmentation. Biostimulation increased oil degradation up to 6.4 times higher than the control. The optimum of fertilizer concentration added was 7.5 mg N/g (C:N ratio of 1,000: 75), which increased depletion rate both in biostimulation-only and the combination of biostimulation with bioaugmentation up to 6.4 and 7.5 times higher than the control, respectively. It is suggested that bioremediation of oil-contaminated sandy beach in Cilacap would be optimal by employing a combination of Slow Release Fertilizer at concentration having C/N ratio = 1,000: 75 and RCO/B/08_008 culture at density of 0.5 x 10 8 cells/mL (100% homology with Alcanivorax sp.

To solve this issue, finding of new antibiotics candidate in an urgency. Natural pigment is known to has biological activity against pathogenic bacteria. Coastal fungi are unexplored source of natural pigment to fight MDR bacteria. This research was aimed to isolate coastal endophytic fungi from smooth ant plant (Hydophytum formicarum), to screen endophytic fungi which produce red pigment, to extract the red pigment, to determine antibacterial activity of the red pigment and to identify the coastal endophytic fungi producing the red pigment. In this study, 7 fungi were isolated as endophytic fungi from H. formicarum. There were 3 isolates which produced extracellular pigment i.e. RS 1A which produced red pigment, RS 3 produced black pigment and RS 6A produced yellow pigment. Our study focused on red pigment which is produced by endophytic fungus strain RS 1A. The yield of red pigment was 8.8657% (w/w). This study showed that red pigment had antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii and Proteus mirabilis strain MDR. Judging from molecular and morphological identification, the endophytic fungus strain RS 1A was identified as Aspergillus versicolor.","Antibacterial; Endophytic fungi; MDR; Pigment",,,,,,,,"Ahmed, S., Kawaguchi, M., Ghosh, S., Paul, S.K., Urushibara, N., Mahmud, C., Nahar, K., Kobayashi, N., Drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in Bangladesh (2015) Microb Drug Resist, 21 (3), pp. 297-306; Akilandeswari, P., Pradeep, B.V., Exploration of industrially important pigments from soil fungi (2016) Appl Microbiol Biotechnol, 100 (4), pp. 1631-1643; Ama, K., Variation in conidiophore complexity of Aspergillus versicolor (2016) Curr Res Environ Appl Mycol, 6 (3), pp. 150-158; Bühler, R.M.M., Müller, B.L., Mortiz, D.E., Vendruscolo, F., de Oliveira, D., Ninow, J.L., Influence of light intensity on growth and pigment production by Monascus ruber in submerged fermentation (2015) Appl Microbiol Biotechnol, 176 (5), pp. 1277-1289; Cao, F., Yang, J.K., Liu, Y.F., Zhu, H.J., Wang, C.Y., Pleosporalone A, the first azaphilone characterized with aromatic A-ring from a marine-derived Pleosporales sp. fungus (2016) Nat Prod Res, 30 (21), pp. 2448-2452. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2016.1198352; Choo, J., Sabri, N.B.M., Tan, D., Mujahid, A., Müller, M., Heavy metal resistant endophytic fungi isolated from Nypa fruticans in Kuching Wetland National Park (2015) Ocean Sci J, 50 (2), pp. 445-453; (2016) Performance Standards for Antimicrobial th Susceptibility Testing, , 26 Ed.

(common name: Knobweed or False Ironwort) belongs to Lamiaceae family and is among known traditional medicine. The Anak Dalam Tribe of Jambi Province uses the leaves of H. capitata to cure external and internal wounds. This study was aimed at identifying and analyzing secretory structure, histochemistry and phytochemical content of H. capitata leaves. The results showed that H. capitata leaves have secretory structures in the form of peltate, capitate and uniseriate glandular trichomes on the upper and lower leaf surfaces, with idioblast cells scattered throughout the leaf mesophyll. Histochemical tests indicated that the peltate trichomes have four head cells, containing alkaloids and terpenoids. This study classified capitate trichomes into two types: 1. type I has one stalk cell and two head cells, all containing alkaloids, terpenoids and lipophilic compounds; 2. type II has long stalk cells consisting of seven to ten cells with one head cell, all containing alkaloids and terpenoids. Uniseriate glandular trichomes of H. capitata leaves consist of four to eight cells containing alkaloids and terpenoids. The idioblast cells are round-shaped and contain lipophilic compounds. GC-MS analysis showed that H. capitata leaves contain terpenoid compounds assumed to serve as anti-infective agents, including l-limonene, eugenol, farnesol isomers A, d-nerolidol, hexahydrofarnesol and neophytadiene.","Glandular trichome; Hyptis capitata; Idioblast; Medicinal plants; Phyto-compounds",,,,,,"CRC","The authors thank Institut Pertanian Bogor (IPB/Bogor Agricultural Universtiy), Indonesia and Göettingen University, Germany, through the Collaborative Research Centre (CRC) 990 Start Up Project in 2012, as well as the Directorate General of Higher Education through BOPTN funding of 2013.

To fulfill space demand, agricultural and forest areas are converted into open or builtup areas because the economic appreciation of forest and agricultural land is lower than that of open or built-up areas. Payment for Environmental Services (PES) is a tool designed to overcome environment mismanagement, which is beneficial for the lives of rural communities. PES should be considered in the formulation of spatial planning. This study was aimed to develop optimum land use pattern in reducing flood in Ciliwung Watershed, using PES approach. This study used a dynamic system approach, consisting of submodels for land use pattern change, runoff, value of farmland, upstream subsidy policy, population dynamics and environmental services. The results showed that the PES policy should be able to maintain the existence of paddy fields and dryland farming areas and to reduce runoff if it is implemented in the form of a guaranteed access to the market, and held in conjunction with efforts to prevent land conversion and to implement reforestation policies. The optimum land use pattern under this condition shall be reached in 2023, which consisted of 0.82% water bodies, 10.74% forest areas, 70.34 % built-up areas, 8.16% dryland farming areas, 4.97% grassland areas, 2.39% paddy fields areas and 2.58% open areas. This land use pattern can reduce runoff in Ciliwung River from 972.04 to 850 cm, and this level is considered to be flood-free. Communities living in the upstream areas are the most effective managers of the watershed.","Ciliwung Watershed; Environmental services payment; Land use pattern",,,,,,"Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China","This research is part of PhD thesis of the first author funded by SEAMEO-BIOTROP DIPA 2015.

This species is very susceptible to environmental changes and at greater risk of extinction due to its small and fragmented geographic ranges and low abundance. Using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) method, the present study predicted the impact of climate change on the distribution of the species across its native distribution area. Elevation and 19 bioclimatic variables commonly used in species distribution modeling were used as predictors. The prediction model of the current potential distribution identified a total area of 156,214 km in Indonesian Papua and Papua New Guinea (18% of total land area) as suitable habitat for F pimenteliana. Elevation and precipitation of the wettest, coldest and warmest quarters contributed most to the model. Based on the average of HadGEM2-ES and MIROC-ESM models, potential distribution projections under RCP8.5 scenario suggested a habitat gain of 16% for 2050 and 8% for 2070 in the species distribution. Whereas under RCP4.5, an average habitat gain of 7% was predicted for both 2050 and 2070. The newly suitable habitats were predicted to be found mainly in Southern and Western Highland of Papua New Guinea. Protection of these areas from habitat destruction and land use change is needed to assist Fpimenteliana find the most suitable climate for its survival.","Climate change; Distribution models; Flindersia pimenteliana; MaxEnt; Prediction",,,,,,,,"Anderson, R.P., Raza, A., The effect of the extent of the study region on GIS models of species geographic distributions and estimates of niche evolution: Preliminary tests with montane rodents (genus Nephelomys) in Venezuela (2010) J Biogeogr, 37, pp. 1378-1393; (2011) Climate change in the Pacific: Scientific assessment and new research, 2. , http://www.pacificclimatechangescience.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Papua-New-Guinea.pdf, Country Reports.

Eight endophytic fungi were isolated. Antagonism test among the isolates was performed to select the most dominant fungus. TP6 was the selected fungus based on the antagonism assay. Crude extracts of the fungus were macerated from the culture broth using ethyl acetate. The strongest antibacterial activity of the extracts was obtained when the fungus was at 12 days of cultivation. The fungal crude extract was strongly active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with inhibition zone diameter of 20, 21 and 23 mm, respectively.","Endophytes; Medicinal plant; Toothache; Traditional medicine",,,,,,,,"Al-Bayati, F.A., Sulaiman, K.D., In vitro antimicrobial activity of Salvadora persica L. extracts against some isolated oral pathogens in Iraq (2007) Turkish J Biol, 32, pp. 57-62; Arnold, A.E., Mejia, L.C., Kyllo, D., Rojas, E.I., Maynard, Z., Robbins, N., Herre, E.A., Fungal endophytes limit pathogen damage in a tropical tree (2003) PNAS, 100 (26), pp. 15649-15654; Barnett, H.L., Hunter, H.H., (1972) Illustrated genera of imperfect fungi, p. 218. , Minneapolis (US): Burgers Company; Bean, R., Straif, K., Grosse, Y., Secretan, B., El Ghissassi, F., Bouvard, V., Carcinogenicity of alcoholic beverages (2007) J Lancet Oncol, 8, pp. 292-293; Demain, A.L., Fang, A., The natural functions of secondary metabolites (2000) Advances in biochemical engineering biotechnology, 69, pp. 20-29. , In: Scheper T, editor.

""Cempo Ireng"") is one of local rice varieties in Sleman Regency, Yogyakarta. The black color is caused by high anthocyanin content which is important source of antioxidant. The cultivation of black rice is still limited due to its tall phenotype, long vegetative stage and low productivity compared to white rice. Paclobutrazol is a growth retardant causing dwarfing in several crop plants and reducing lodging. Blue light can improve plant quality. This research was aimed to evaluate the effect of blue light and paclobutrazol on seed germination, vegetative growth and yield of black rice. The results showed that the average of seed germination as well as the activity of α-amylase of seeds subjected to blue light were lower compared to those subjected to sunlight; however, paclobutrazol concentrations did not affect seed germination percentage. The height of rice plants treated with paclobutrazol decreased in accordance with the increase of paclobutrazol concentration. Chlorophyll content and tiller numbers increased by paclobutrazol treatment of 12.5 ppm. Nitrate reductase activity was higher in rice seedlings subjected to blue light compared to those subjected to sunlight. Iron (Fe) content of rice plants treated with 25 or 50 ppm paclobutrazol increased compared to control. It was concluded that paclobutrazol application of 12.5 ppm already reduced plant height. The higher concentration of paclobutrazol applied the greater reduction on plant height was observed. Blue light treatment applied during black rice seed germination slightly reduced germination percentage and α-amylase activity in the germinated seeds. However, blue light treatment combined with paclobutrazol application during black rice seed germination increased chlorophyll content, tiller numbers and Fe content in black rice grain.","Anthocyanin; Blue light; Fe content; Paclobutrazol; α-amylase activity",,,,,,,,"Adil, O.S., Rahim, A., Elamin, O.M., Bangerth, F.K., Effects of paclobutrazol (PBZ) on floral induction and associated hormonal and metabolic changes of biennialy bearing mango (Mangifera indica L.) cultivars during off year (2011) ARPN J Ag & Bio Sci, 6 (2), pp. 55-67; Ali, A., Sivakami, S., Raghuram, N., Regulation of activity and transcript levels of NR in rice (Oryza sativa): roles of protein kinase and G-proteins (2007) Plant Sci, 172, pp. 406-413; Ashikari, M., Ueguchi-Tanaka, M., Sasaki, A., Matsuoka, M., Loss-of-function of a rice gibberellin biosynthetic gene, GA20 oxidase (GA20ox-2), led to the rice 'Green Revolution' (2002) Breed Sci, 52 (2), pp. 143-150; Barrero, J.M., Downie, A.B., Xu, Q., Gubler, F., A role for barley CRYPTOCHROME1 in light regulation of grain dormancy and germination (2014) Plant Cell, 26, pp. 1094-1104; Bayat, S., Sepehri, A., Paclobutrazol and salicylic acid application ameliorates the negative effect of water stress on growth and yield of maize plants (2012) J Res Agric Sci, 8 (2), pp. 127-139; Bidadi, H., Yamaguchi, Asahina, M., Satoh, S., Effects of shoot-applied gibberellin/gibberellin-biosynthesis inhibitors on root growth and expression of gibberellins biosynthesis genes in Arabidopsis thaliana (2009) Plant Root, 4, pp. 4-11; Bridgemohan, P., Bridgemohan, R.S.H., Evaluation of anti-lodging plant growth regulators on the growth and development of rice (Oryza sativa) (2014) J Cereals Oilseeds, 5 (3), pp. 12-16; Chaney, W.R., (2005) Growth retardants: a promising tool for managing urban trees, , http://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/FNR/FNR-252-W.pdf, Purdue Extension document FNR-252-W.

Until now soybean demand cannot be fulfilled by domestic production, although the chances of fulfillment can be attempted. One of the attempts to increase domestic production is soybean planting in acid dry land that is widely available in Indonesia. The research aimed to obtain soybean lines that are adaptive in acid dry land. A total of 10 soybean promising lines and two check varieties (Wilis and Tanggamus) were grown in acid dry land in Tanah Laut Regency, South Kalimantan Province, Indonesia. Experimental design used was randomized complete block design with four replications. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance and followed by Least Significant Different test. The results showed that the promising lines of SC5P2P3.5.4.1-5 and SC5P2P3.23.4.1-5 achieved production of 1.51 t/ha and 1.48 t/ha, respectively. These yields were higher than Wilis and Tanggamus varieties that reached 1.41 t/ha and 1.13 t/ha, respectively. These two promising lines had the potency to be developed in Tanah Laut Regency, South Kalimantan or other areaswith similar soil characteristics.","Acid dry land; Soybean; Tanah Laut Regency; Ultisols",,,,,,,,"Arshad, M., Ali, N., Ghafoor, A., Character correlation and path coefficient in soybean Glycine max (L.)

The aim of this study was to investigate the diversity of orchids and their host trees (phorophytes) in a secondary forest of Coban Trisula (the Trisula waterfall) of Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park in East Java Province, Indonesia. Two line transectswere established.Each transectwas 150mlong and composed of fifteen 10 x 10 m plots, resulting in the total number of 30 sampling plots at the study site. The following data were recorded in each plot: species name and individual numbers of epiphytic orchids, species name and individual numbers of the phorophytes and vertical distribution of the orchids on the phorophyte. There were 15 epiphytic orchid species found from 13 genera in the secondary forest of Coban Trisula. Appendicula angustifolia was the most abundant epiphytic orchid species (Relative abundance =52.4%), followed by Trichotosia annulata (29.9%). All recorded orchids grew on 21 individuals from nine phorophyte species. Castanopsis javanica (mean = 589.5 individuals/tree) and Engelhardia spicata (mean = 425.67 orchid individuals/tree) were phorophytes hosting the largest number of individual orchids, respectively. The greatest abundance of epiphytic orchidswas on the basal and themiddle part of phorophyte branches (zone 3 and zone 4). This study indicated that orchid conservationmanagement is required in the Coban Trisula to protect the survival of orchids in this area frompotential human disturbances, as Coban Trisula is one of tourist destination. © 2015 Seameo Biotrop.","CobanTrisula; Diversity; Epiphytic orchid; Phorophyte; Secondary forest",,,,,,,,"Adhikari, Y.P., Fischer, H.S., Fischer, A., Host tree utilization by epiphytic orchids in different land-use intensities in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal (2012) Plant Ecol, 213, pp. 1393-112; Annaselvam, J., Parthasarathy, N., Diversity and distribution of herbaceous vascular epiphytes in a tropical evergreen forest at Varagalaiar, Western Ghats, India (2001) Biodivers Conserv, 10, pp. 317-329; Ballantyne, M., Pickering, C.M., Tourism and recreation: a common threat to IUCN red-listed vascular plants in Europe (2013) Biodivers Conserv, 22 (13), pp. 3027-3044; Barthlott, W., Schmit-Neuerburg, V., Nieder, J., Engwald, S., Diversity and abundance of vascular epiphytes: a comparison of secondary vegetation and primary montane rain forest in the Venezuelan Andes (2001) PlantEcol, 152, pp. 145-156; Cardelus, C.L., Mack, M.C., The nutrient status of epiphytes and their host trees along an elevational gradient in Costa Rica (2010) Plant Ecol, 207, pp. 25-37; Calderon-Aguilera, L.E., Rivera-Monroy, V.H., Porter-Bolland, L., Martinez-Yrizar, A., Ladah, L.B., Martinez-Ramos, M., Alcorer, J., Burquez, A., An assessment of natural and human disturbance effects on Mexican ecosystems: current trends and research gaps (2012) Biodivers Conserv, 21, pp. 589-617; Comber, J.B., (1990) Orchids of Java, , Surrey (UK): Bentham-Moxon Trust Royal Botanic Gardens Kew; Comber, J.B., (2001) Orchids of Sumatra, , Surrey (UK): The Royal Botanic Gardens Kew; Dressier, R.L., (1981) The Orchids: Natural History and Classification, , Cambtidge (US): Harvard University Press; Dressier, R.L., (1993) Phylogeny and Classification of the Orchid Family, , Cambridge (UK): Cambridge University Press; Focho, D.A., Fonge, B.A., Fongo, A.G.N., Essomo, S.E., A study of the distribution and diversity of the Family Orchidaceae on some selected lava flows of Mount Cameroon (2010) Afr J of Environ Sci Technol, 4 (5), pp. 263-273; Gentry, A.H., Dodson, C.H., Diversity and biogeography of neotropical vascular epiphytes (1987) Ann MissouriBot Gard, 74 (2), pp. 205-233; Hardyanti, S.A., Hakim, L., Pengetahuan Masyarakat Desa Ranupani terhadap Pohon di Hutan Tropis Pegunungan Tengger-Ranupani (2014) J Biotropika, 2 (1), pp. 1-7; (1996) Orchids-Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan, , Cambridge (UK): IUCN, Gland Switzerland and Cambridge; Johansson, D., Ecology of vascular epiphytes in West African rain forest (1974) Acta Phytogeogr Suec, 59, pp. 1-136; Koopowitz, H., Dixon, K.W., The nature of threats to orchid conservation (2003) Orchid Conservation: History Publications (Borneo), pp. 25-42. , In: Dixon KW, Kell SP, Barrett RL, Cribb PJ, editors.

This study was conducted to obtain information on the carbohydrate and lignin characteristic changes after combined biological and microwave pretreatment of betung bamboo. Based on our previous research, incubation for 30 days using 5 and 10% (w/v) inoculum loading of white rot fungi, Trametes versicolor which has better delignification selectivity compared to the other incubation time, was chosen as the fungal pretreatment prior to microwave pretreatment for 5, 10 and 12.5 minutes at 330 W. The evaluation of characteristic changes after pretreatment was performed using the analysis of FTIR spectroscopy,X-Ray diffraction and SEM. FTIR spectra demonstrated that the combined pretreatment only affected the change of intensity bands of FTIR spectra, without any changes in the functional groups. This band intensity decrease occurred on unconjugated bonds of carbohydrate peaked at 1,736 cm -1 (C =0 in xylan), 1,373 cm -1 (C-Hdeformation in cellulose and hemicellulose), 1,165 cm -1 (C-O-C vibration in cellulose -1 -1 and hemicellulose) and 895 cm -1 (C-H deformation or C-O-C stretching at β-glicosidic linkage characteristic in -1 cellulose). The pretreatment decreased the hydrogen bond stretching of cellulose and the linkage between lignin and carbohydrate. This decrease of hydrogen bond was associated with crystallinity of bamboo cellulose, illustrated by occurring structural changes. The crystallinity index tended to increase slightly due to the cleavage of the amorphous fraction. SEMimages illustrated that the pretreatment disrupted the fiber structure. The longer duration of microwave irradiation, the greater the degradation level of fiber. © 2015 Seameo Biotrop.","Betung bamboo; Carbohydrate and lignin changes; Combined biological andmicrowave pretreatment; FTIR; SEM; XRD",,,,,,,,"Agbor, V.B., Cicek, N., Sparling, R., Berlin, A., Levin, D.B., Biomass pretreatment: fundamentals toward application (2011) BiotechnolAdv, 29, pp. 675-685; Anita, S.H., Risanto, L., Hermiati, E., Fatriasari, W., Pretreatment of Oil Palm Empty Fruit Bunch (OPEFB) using microwave irradiati (2012) In: The 3' International Symposium of IWORS (Indonesia Wood Research Society).

Reliablemethods are needed to detect and to reduce plant off-type. This research was conducted to confirm the occurrence of somaclonal variation during micropropagation of pineapple clone Simadu. The culture period (long- and short-period) and the regeneration methods (direct organogenesis, indirect organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis) were studied to know their contribution in bringing out somaclonal variation. RAPD analysis using 10 primers was performed to confirm genetic variation. The result showed that RAPDassay could be applied as early detection of somaclonal variation of pineapple, where OPA primers were better to be used than OPJ primers. The phenotypic variation occurred in the four year-old pineapple plants and plantlets were due to genetic variation. It has proved that the long-period of cultures is the main contributor of somaclonal variation, while the regeneration method and plant growth regulator could also induce genetic variation. The new cultures showed higher level of similarity. Therefore, it needs a correct strategy to apply micropropagation method of pineapple to minimize plant off-type. It was recommended to avoid the use of long-period culture as mother stock and to apply direct organogenesis method for micropropagation rather than indirect organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis. © 2015 Seameo Biotrop.","Ananas comosus (L.)Merr.; Molecularmarkers; Plant off-type",,,,,,,,"Abdellatif, K.F., Hegazy, A.E., Aboshama, H.M., Emara, H.A., El-Shahed, A.A., Morphological and molecular characterization of somaclonal variations in tissue culture-derived banana plants (2012) J Genet Eng Biotechnol, 10, pp. 47-53; Ahmed, A.B.A., Rao, A.S., Rao, M.V., Taha, M., Effect of picloram, additives and plant growth regulators on somatic embryogenesis of Phyla nodiflora (L.)

Quantitative management variables become very important to support yield regulation tools for achieving sustainable forest management. The study objective was to determine mortality and ingrowth rates to formulate biometric characteristic variability of dipterocarps forest in logged-over forests based on time series data. The study site was located in Labanan, East Kalimantan Province. Permanent measurement plots within logged-over forest were located to represent three different logging techniques, i.e. a) reduced impact logging with diameter limit 50 cm(RIL 50); b) RIL 60; c) conventional logging; and d) primary forest as control. Total plot permanent area was about 48 ha and was measured periodically every 2 years within 17 years after logging. For data analysis purpose, trees were divided into two major groups, i.e. Dipterocarps and non- Dipterocarps. Range of mortality rates for all species in logged-over forest were 2.5-29.3%per ha per 2 years which was very close to primary forest at year-5 after logging. While range of ingrowth rate for all species in logged forest were 1.3-21.3%per ha per 2 years which were higher than those for the primary forest within 17 years. Themortality and ingrowth rates fluctuation of Dipterocarps species groupwere different fromthose of non-Dipterocarps.","Dipterocarps; Ingrowth; Logged-over forest,mortality",,,,,,,,"Adams, H.D., Kolbs, T.E., Tree growth response to drought and temperature in amountain landscape in NorthernArizona,USA (2005) JBiogeogr, 32, pp. 1629-1640; Ashton, P.S., Dipterocarpaceae (1982) Flora Malesiana The Netherlands, 1 (9), pp. 237-552; Chertov, O., Komarov, A., Mikhailov, A., Andrienko, G., Andrienko, N., Gatalsky, P., Geovisualization of forest simulation modeling results: A case study of carbon sequestration and biodiversity (2005) Comput ElectronAgr, 49, pp. 175-191; Davis, L.S., Johnson, K.N., Bettinger, P.S., Howard, T.E., (2001) Forest Management: To Sustain Ecological, Economic and Social Value, , Fourth Edition.

Previous study reported that Begomovirus has infected several Leguminosae in South Asia. Several Begomoviruses have been reported to infect important crops in Indonesia. Those Begomoviruses were characterized based on nucleotide sequences. This study was conducted to identify and characterize Begomovirus taken from yard long bean samples in Java based on specific genome property of common region. Three main activities were conducted: i) sample collection in yard long bean fields located in Central Java (Tegal, Magelang, and Klaten), Yogyakarta (Sleman), and West Java (Bogor and Subang) provinces; ii) virus detection using I-ELISA, PCR, and sequencing; iii) molecular characterization of Begomovirus using software BioEdit v.7.0.5 and MEGA 6.06. Yellow mosaic disease was found in almost all fields. Infection of Potyvirus and Begomovirus was detected using I-ELISA and PCR, respectively. Both viruses were detected as either single or mixed infection. Samples collected from Tegal, Klaten, Magelang, Subang and Bogor were positively infected by Begomovirus based on specific viral DNA amplification. Sequence analysis indicated that Begomovirus infecting yard long bean is Mungbean Yellow Mosaic India Virus (MYMIV) and it belongs to the same group with MYMIV from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Nepal. Further analysis showed the conserved region of Begomovirus around Common Region, i.e. ""TATA box"" sequence, hair pin loop structure, repetitive sequence and the conserved nonanucleotide sequence TAATATTAC were also determined. This is the first report of MYMIV infection in Indonesia.","Begomovirus; Common region; DNA sequencing; I-ELISA; MYMIV; PCR; Yard long bean","Begomovirus; Fabaceae; Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus; Potyvirus; Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis",,,,,,,"Aidawati, N., Hidayat, S.H., Suseno, R., Hidayat, P., Sujiprihati, S., Identifikasi geminivirus yang menginfeksi tomat berdasarkan pada teknik polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (2005) J Mikrobiol Indon, 10 (1), pp. 29-32; Argüelo-Astorga, G.R., Guevara-González, R.G., Herrera-Estrella, L.R., Riverabustamante, R.F., Geminivirus replication origins have a groupspecific organization of iterative elements: a model for replication (1994) Virology, 203, p. 90100; Damayanti, T.A., Alabi, O.J., Rauf, A., Naidu, R.A., Severe outbreak of yellow mosaic disease on the yard long bean in Bogor, West Java (2009) HAYATI J of Biosci, 16 (2), pp. 78-82; Doyle, J.J., Doyle, J.J., A rapid DNA isolation of procedure for small quantities of fresh leaf tissue (1987) Phytochem Bull, 19, pp. 11-19; Fauquet, C.M., Mayo, M.A., Maniloff, J., Desselberger, U., Ball, L.A., (2005) Eight Report oVirus Taxonomy f the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, , San Diego (US): VirolDivInt Union of Microb Soc; Hidayat, S.H., Chatchawankanpanich, O., Rusli, E., Aidawati, N., Begomovirus associated with pepper yellow leaf curl disease in West Java, Indonesia (2006) J Mikrobiol Indon, 11, pp. 87-90; Hidayat, S.H., Chatchawankapanich, O., Aidawati, N., Molecular identification and sequence analysis of Tobacco Leaf Curl Virus from Jember, East Java, Indonesia (2008) HAYATI J of Biosci, 15 (1), pp. 13-17; Hull, R., (2002) Matthew's Plant Virology, , 4 Ed.

The influence of those factors, especially habitat characteristic, needs to be defined to support plant conservation management. This study was aimed to: 1) measure plant growth dependence on theirmicrohabitat; 2) definemicrohabitat variables that significantly influence the growth; and 3) develop suitable conservationmeasures at species level. Ramin (Gonystylus bancanus) is one of major timber species that has been facing high exploitation in Indonesia. This species is usually found on specific ""peat swamps"" ecosystem. Data were collected through primary surveys in Riau Province and analyzed by clustering the adult based on total height and basal area variables, and describing the distribution pattern of the cluster. Then, Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) was used to overlay the cluster with the distribution of microhabitat characteristic consisting altitude, slope soil humidity, soil pH, peat depth, and canopy cover (measured in percentage). The results showed that distribution of microhabitat matched with 67.4% of height distribution and 78.3% of width distribution of tree basal area. Altitude and canopy cover percentage had significant correlation with total height distribution (α=0.05).Meanwhile altitude, canopy cover, and slope had significant correlation with basal area (α=0.1). However, peat depth variable showed an interesting pattern since shallower peat depth was followed by wider of basal area. High correlation between plant growth and itsmicrohabitat suggested that to conserve G. bancanus, in-situ conservation offered better strategy than ex-situ conservation.","Discriminant function analysis; Gonystylus bancanus; Microhabitat; Peat swamp forest; Plant growth distribution; Ramin","Animalia; Gonystylus bancanus",,,,,,,"Bismark, M., Kalima, T., Wibowo, A., Sawitri, R., (2005) Growing Stock, Distribution and Conservation of Ramin in Indonesia, , Technical ReportNo. 01.

The presence of the fungi and its aflatoxin become serious problem on food safety. This research was aimed to isolate and identify A. flavus from peanut and its processed products collected from some traditional markets in Bogor, Depok and Jakarta, and detection of their aflatoxin genes. Fungal isolation was using AFPA media. Fungal identification was carried out by combining morphological and molecular analysis using species specific primers FVAVIQ1 /FLAQ2 and AFLA-F/AFLA-R, while detection of aflatoxin genes employed four specific primers of apa-2 (aflK), nor-1 (aflD), ver-1 (aflM) and omt-1 (aflP). From 36 samples, the A. flavus group was only found in peanut kernels samples with viable count of specific colonies in the range of 0.01-5.52 x 10 cfu/g The total of 18 isolates were identified as A. flavus based on species specific primers FVAVIQ1/FLAQ2 and AFLA-F/AFLA-R by producing amplicons about 100 and 413 bp, respectively. Based on aflatoxin gene analysis it was showed that all 18 isolates was successfully amplified by both apa-2 and nor-1, 83.3 %by omt-1 and 72.2% by wr-/ genes which taking part in aflatoxin production. The amplicons size of apa-2, nor-1, ver-1 and omt-1 primer pairs were about 1032,400,895 and 1024 bp, respectively. © 2014 Seameo Biotrop.","Aflatoxin genes; AFPA; Aspergillus flavus; Peanut; Species specific primers",,,,,,,,"Abdel-Hadi, A., Carter, D., Magan, A., Temporal monitoring of the nor-1 {aflD) gene of Aspergillus flavus in relation to aflatoxin Bl production during storage of peanuts under different water activity levels (2010) J Appl Microbiol, 109, pp. 1914-1922; Bhatnagar, D., Cary, J., Ehrlich, K., Yu, J., Cleveland, T., Understanding the genetics of regulation of aflatoxin production and Aspergillus flavus development (2006) Mycopathol, 262; Analisis hujan bulan Januari 2013 dan prakiraan hujan bulan Maret (2013) Buletin BMKG, , April dan Mei StasiunKlimatologiDarmaga.

Majority of root plants have symbiotic associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF); however, AMF in bisbul has never been reported. The objective of this study was to observe AMF colonies and to identify AMF spores in bisbul tree rhizospheres and in potcultured Pueraria javanica. Roots and soil samples from bisbul rhizospheres were collected from three locations in Bogor area. Roots were stained using trypan blue 0.05%. Soil samples were air dried, then parts of them were used for spore isolation and the rest were used for pot cultures. Spores were isolated by wet sieving and decanting method and then continued with centrifugation. The results showed that the structures of AMF colonies in bisbul roots were arbuscules, vesicles, coiled hyphae, and internal hyphae. Isolated AMF spores were identified as Acaulospora longula, A. scrobiculata, A. tuberculata, Claroideoglomusgeosporum, Funneliformis etunicatum, Gigaspora candida, G. ramisporophora, Glomus albidum, G. glomerulatum, and Scutellospora calospora. This is the first report of mycorrhizal infection in the root of bisbul and AMF association with bisbulroot.","AM Fungi; Diospyros blancoi; Symbiosis",,,,,,,,"Becker, W.N., Gedermann, J.W., Glomusetunicatus sp. nov.

Seven isolates of bacteria were isolated from surface-sterilized AMF spores of Gigaspora sp. (GG) and five isolates of bacteria isolated from Glomus sp. (GL). All bacterial isolates were identified based on its morphological methods and biochemical reaction and revealed that 9 isolates belong to genus Bacillus, while the other 3 isolates belong to genus Pseudomonas, Proteous and Enterobacter respectively. The tests to the antagonists against fungal pathogens and stimulation of AMF hyphal development of Gigaspora sp. in vitro showed that there were 3 isolates of bacteria (Bacillus subtilis GG1, Pseudomonas diminuta GG5 and Enterobacter hormaechei GL3) had the ability to inhibit the growth of pathogens and to enhance the development of AMF hyphae Gigaspora sp in vitro. These three bacteria isolates potentially can be used to enhance the quality of AMF inoculants as biocontrol and biofertilizers. Enzymatic activity test showed that there were 7 isolates of bacteria that produced cellulase and protease activities, i.e. Bacillus subtilis GG1, Bacillus cereus GG3, Bacillus laterosporus GG6, Bacillus pasteurii GG7, Proteus penneri GL2,Bacillus firmus GL4 and Bacillus cereus GL5.","Antagonistic effects;

The area is important as a natural habitat of the forest wallaby. Four habitat types comprising 6 plant communities could be distinguished belonging to grassland, four different types of open forest and undisturbed primary closed forest. A vegetation table is presented and species composition is described. Each vegetation plot the presence of trails, wallaby droppings, food remains and signs of human disturbance, i.e. logging, hunting and gardening activity, and distance to settlement areas was noted. The presence of Wallabies could only be noted in grassland, open forest with only little logging activity, and in undisturbed closed forest. It is strongly correlated to distance from villages and negatively correlated to logging and hunting. The relation with food plant availability appears to be only low. The results indicate that vegetation structure, vegetation composition and food plant availability are less important than human disturbance. Regulations reducing the disturbance by logging and hunting are urgently needed.","Papua; Plantcommunities; Tropical forest; Vegetation analysis; Wallaby; Wildlife",,,,,,,,"Arijani, S.D., Edi, G., Ibnul, Q., Vegetation analysis of the up-stream Cianjur watershed in Mount Gede- Pangrango National Park's (2006) Biodiversitas, 7; Alhamid, H., (1988) Studi Habitat dan Populasi Burung Cenderawasih kecil (Paradisea minor-minor, Shaw) di Areal Bekas Tebangan PT, , Inhutani II Dalam Kawasan Cagar Alam Pegunungan Arfak Manokwari.

The objective of the study was to describe the Begonia species found in these forest sites, to gather information on microclimatic variables and to find the influences of these variables on the abundance of Begonia species. Three species were identified, B. multangula, B. baliensis and B. longifolia. There were two forms of B. longifolia, white and red. The multivariate analysis (PCA) showed that microclimatic variables measured were relatively similar among plots and hence, no particular microclimatic variable influenced Begonia species abundance. However, the multivariate analysis implied that B. longifolia has a different microclimate preference between forms (white and red). B. longifolia f. white was highly correlated to Axis 1 (99%) and B. longifolia f. red was highly correlated to Axis 2 (92%) of the PCAgraph. The abundance of all species in the two forest sites was similar (t-test,p=0.061).","Bedugul; Begonia sp.; Microclimate; Multivariate analysis; Natural habitat",,,,,,,,"Chiew, H., (2005) Begonias Under Threat.

In the case of Mount Merapi volcanic eruption, studies on the relationships between edaphic factors and plant community composition and distribution following the nuées ardentes-igpited wildfires will provide valuable information on post-disturbance secondary successional processes. We collected soil and vegetation data from five different ages of nuees ardentes fire-affected secondary succession forests and one un-affected forest. Our results showed significant correlation of species composition and edaphic factors among sites of secondary forests. Nitrogen and soil water content were found to be the important factors in structuring species composition in the youngest site, where the N-fixing legume species such as Calliandra callothyrsuswas found to be dominant. CCA ordination also revealed strong negative correlation between nitrogen content and legume group, while non-legume group were positively correlated with other edaphic factors such as phosphor and potassium. These findings suggested that changes in soil properties due to recovery of this system after volcanic eruption correlated with plant community composition and can be crucial factors in driving the successional trajectory. Understanding ecosystem reassembly process and trajectory of succession will improve how we approach the restoration of Mount Merapi ecosystem.","Edaphic factors; Mount merapi; Plant community; Sucession; Wildfires",,,,,,,,"Backer, C.A., van den Brink, R.C.B., (1963), Flora of Java (Spermatophytes Only) Vol. n.

A total of 150 bryophytes species were identified, including 67 species of mosses (Bryopsida) and 83 of liverworts (Hepaticopsida). Both bryophyte groups varied in diversity and abundance between arboreal and terrestrial communities as well as among different elevations. Species diversity of arboreal habitats (116 species)was higher than that of terrestrial habitats (64 species). Moss specieswere more abundant in terms of coverage in terrestrial habitats whereas liverworts species were more abundant in arboreal habitats. Species richness in both terrestrial and arboreal habitats decreased towards higher elevation, whereas the abundance increased.","Arboreal habitat; Bryophytes; Liverworts; Mosses; Terrestrial habitat",,,,,,,,"Acebey, C., Gradstein, S.R., Kromer, T., Species richness and habitat diversivication of bryophytes in submontane rain forest and fallows in Bolivia (2003) Journal of Tropical Ecology, 18, pp. 1-16; Andrew, N.R., Rodgerson, L., Dunlop, M., Variation in invertebrate - bryophyte communitiy structure at different spatial scales alongaltitudinalgradients (2003) Journalof Biogeography, 30, pp. 731-746; Ariyanti, N.S., Bos, M.M., Kartawinata, K., Tjitrosoedirdjo, S.S., Guhardja, E., Gradstein, S.R., Bryophytes on tree trunks in natural forests, selectively logged forests and cacao agroforests in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia (2008) Biological Conservation, 141, pp. 2516-2527; Aryanti, N.S., Gradstein, S.R., Sporn, S.G., Angelika, E., Tan, B.C., Catalogue of the bryophytes of Sulawesi (2009) Suppplement 1.

The main problem faced by humpback culture is its slow growth rate. One of the methods that will be more effective and efficient to solve the problem is using transgenic technique. This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of transfection, microinjection and electroporation techniques on gene transfer in humpback grouper. In vitro transfection was performed by incubating sperm to the foreign DNA (pktBP-ktGH gene construct)-transfectant complex solution, while in vivo was by injecting those complex solution into testis of mature males. Microinjection was conducted in 2-4 cell stage embryos using 25 μg/ml of foreign DNA solution, and duration of injection was 1, 2 and 3 seconds. Electroporation by 50 V, 30 ms of pulse length, 5 of pulse number and 0.1 of pulse interval was performed to sperm using three DNA concentration of 5, 10 and 20 μg/ml. The incorporation of foreign DNA in sperm and embryos were analyzed using PCR method. Based on PCR analysis, an optimum DNA concentration for electroporation was 10 μg/ml. Limited number of embryos could be microinjected during 20-30 min to reach 2-4 cell stage. Microinjection for 1 second showed higher survival rate of embryos, although none or very low number of larvae was hatched. Transfast was an effective DNA delivery reagent for humpback grouper sperm. Foreign DNA could be detected in sperm from two out of ten in vivo transfected fish at least 36 hours post transfection (hpt). By in vitro transfection, foreign DNA was detected in sperm at 48 hpt 25 °C incubation temperature. Our study revealed that transfection, microinjection as well as electroporation could be used as transgenesis methods in humpback grouper. By means of simplicity and efficacy, however, electroporationwas an appropriate gene transfer method.","Electroporation; Humpback grouper; Microinjection; Transfection; Transgenesis","Cromileptes altivelis; Pisces",,,,,,,"Alimuddin, Nugrahani, W., Aliah, R.S., Sumantadinata, K., Faizal, I., Carman, O., Yoshizaki, G., Isolation and characterization of β-actin promoter from humpback grouper (2007) Jurnal Riset Akuakultur, 2, pp. 199-209. , In Indonesian; Alimuddin, Yoshizaki, G., Carman, O., Sumantadinata, K., Application of gene transfer technology in aquaculture (2003) Jurnal Akuakultur Indonesia, 2, pp. 41-50. , In Indonesian; Alimuddin, Yoshizaki, G., Kiron, V., Satoh, S., Takeuchi, T., Enhancement of EPA and DHA biosynthesis by over-expression of masu salmon Δ6-desaturase-like gene in zebrafish (2005) Transgenic Research, 14, pp. 159-165; Alimuddin, Kiron, V., Satoh, S., Takeuchi, T., Yoshizaki, G., Cloning and over-expression of a masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) fatty acid elongase-like gene in zebrafish (2008) Aquaculture, 282, pp. 13-18; (2006) Instruction manual: gene pulser xcell electroporation system, , Anonymous, BioRad catalog number 74, BioRad office; Ath-Thar, M.F., (2007) Effectiveness of β-actin promoter from Japanese medaka Oryzias latipes using hrGFP (humanized Renilla reniformis green fluorescent protein) gene as a marker in catfish Clarias sp F0 generation, , Undergraduate thesis.

In Demak regency sorghum cultivation was monoculture, variety cultivated was UPC-S1. In Wonogiri regency sorghum cultivation was intercropping with secondary crop and cassava. Sorghum varieties cultivated were Kawali, Numbu, ZH30, Mandau and Hibrida hybrids. There was a difference between the method of postharvest handling of sorghum at farmer and collector levels in Demak and Wonogiri regencies. In general the method of postharvest handling of sorghum in Demak regency was more appropriate and more advance compared to that in Wonogiri regency. The moisture contents of sorghum at farmer as well as at collector level in Demak regency (13.0%) and Wonogiri regency (12.9%) were still lower that that of normal (safe) moisture content of sorghum. The number of insect species associated with sorghum in various distribution level in Demak and Wonogiri regencies was 10 and 17 species, respectively. The dominant insects species were Sitophilus zeamais and Tribolium castaneum. The number of fungal species found in sorghum at various distribution level in Demak and Wonogiri regencies was 23 species, respectively. In general, the dominant fungal species were Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium semitectum and F. verticillioides. In Demak regency aflatoxin B1 contents of sorghum at farmer and collector levels were 22.50 and 15.45 ppb, respectively, while in Wonogiri regency 2.27 and 10.28 ppb, respectively. © 2011 Seameo Biotrop.","Aflatoxin B1; Central Java; Demak and Wonogiri regencies; Fungi; Insects; Stored sorghum",,,,,,,,"Natural toxins (2005) Official methods of Analysisof AOAC International, p. 11. , InHorwitzW, editor 18th ed.

Unless biodiversity surveys are intensified, the true magnitude of extinctions will never be ascertained. The objectives of this study were to determine tree species composition of limestone hills in Nyungcung and Ciampea; to determine quantitatively the dominant and less dominant species and to quantify floristic structure of the two limestone hills Value of richness (Menhinick) and evenness in Nyungcung were 3.28 and 0.826 while in Ciampea were 3.29 and 0.823, respectively. In term of diversity (Shannon Wiener), Nyungcung seems to be more diverse than Ciampea as indicated by the higher value of diversity index. Nyungcung has 3.225 of diversity (Shannon Wiener) index while Ciampea has 2.859. The floristic composition of two sites was significantly different and mostly comprised Moraceae, Rubiaceae, and Euphorbiaceae. However, the highest presence of species were Antidesma montanum (Euphorbiaceae) and Chrysophyllum lanceolatum (Sapotaceae), and Pandanus sp.

Spermatozoa that have been collected from cauda epididymis were diluted with Andromed® extender as control (K) and Andromed® + 0.2% dextrose (P1) and Andromed® + 0.4% dextrose (P2) as treatments. The results showed that the quality of epididymal spermatozoa decreased during cryopreservation process. The percentage of motility after thawing in P1 (46%) and P2 (46.67%) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) compared to K (41%) as well as the percentage of live sperm in P1 (58.8%) and P2 (60%) compared to K (52.2%). The percentage of membrane integrity in P1, P2 and K were 67.4; 66.8 and 68 %, respectively. In conclusion, the addition of 0.2 and 0.4% of dextrose into Andromed® acted as an extra cellular cryoprotectant and could maintain the viability and membrane integrity of the spotted buffalo epididymal spermatozoa after thawing. © 2009, Seameo Biotrop.","Cryopreservation; Dextrose; Epididymal sperm; Spotted buffalo",,,,,,,,"Aisen E.G.Alvarez, H.L., Venturino, A., Garde, J.J., Effect of trehalose and EDTA oncryoprotective action of ram semen diluents (2000) Theriogenology, 53 (5), pp. 1053-1061; Aisen E.G.Medina, V.H., Venturino, A., Cryopreservation and post-thawed fertility of ram frozen semen in different trehalose concentrations (2002) Theriogenology, 57, pp. 1801-1808; Ax R.L.Dally, M., Didion, B.A., Lenz, R.W., Love, C.C., Varner, D.D., Hafez, B., Bellin, M.E., Semen Evaluation (2000) Reproduction in Farm Animals, pp. 365-375. , In: Hafez B and Hafez ESE. 7th Ed.

While Sumatran orangutan is primarily found in northern Sumatra, the Bornean is distributed in Central, West, and East Kalimantan, Sarawak and Sabah. The determination of intra- and inter-species variation between Bornean and Sumatran orangutans has been stated to be essential for both the management of orangutan reintroduction projects and the planning of conservation strategies to preserve the remaining wild populations. This study aimed to identify two species of Orangutans (Pongo sp.) by means of RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms) analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). An approximately 540 bp single fragment of the ND5 gene near the 5'-region was PCR amplified for all samples tested. Digestion pattern for both AluI and MseI were different between two groups of ND5 fragments in this study. Present result showed a rapid protocol to identify these two species by means of RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) analyses of mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA). This technique can be applied easily to rehabilitation centres and zoos to resolve species discrimination problem. © 2009, Seameo Biotrop.","Borneo; Discrimination; Orangutans; Pongo sp.; Sumatra",,,,,,,,"Groves, C.P., Pongo pygmaeus (1971) Mammalian Species, 4, pp. 1-6; Janczewski, D.N., Goldman, D., O'Brien, S.J., Molecular genetic divergence of orangutan (Pongo pygmaes) subspecies based on isozyme and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (1990) Journal of Heredity, 81, pp. 375-387; Muir, C.C., Galdikas, B.M.F., Beckenbach, A.T., Is there sufficient evidence to elevate the orangutan of Borneo and Sumatra to separate species (1998) Journal of Molecular Evolution, 51, pp. 471-480; O'Brien, S.J., Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of endangered species (1994) Annual Review of Genetics, 28, pp. 467-489; Rijksen, H.D., Meijaard, E., (1999) Our vanishing relative; the status of wild orang-utans at the close of the twentieth century, , Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, the Netherlands; Uchida, A., What we don't know about great ape variation (1996) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 11, pp. 163-168; Warren K.S.Verschoor, E.J., Langenhuijen, S., Heriyanto Swan, R.A., Vigilant, L., Heeney, J.L., Speciation and Intrasubspecific variation of Bornean Orangutan, Pongopygmaeus pygmaeus (2001) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 18, pp. 472-480; Xu, X., Arnason, U., The mitochondrial DNA molecule of Sumatran and a molecular proposal for two (Bornean and Sumatra) species of orangutan (1996) Journal of Molecular Evolution, 43, pp. 431-437; Zang, Y., Ryder, O.A., Zhang, Y., Genetic divergence of orangutan subspecies (Pongo pygmaeus) (2001) Journal of Molecular Evolution, 52, pp. 516-526; Zhi, L., Karesh, W.B., Kanczewski, D.N., Frazier-Taylor, H., Sajuthi, D., Gombek, F., Andau, M., O'Brien, S.J., Genomic differentiation among natural populations of orang-utan (Pongo pygmaeus) (1996) Current Biology, 6, pp. 1326-1336","Perwitasari-Farajallah, D.; Primate Research Center, Bogor Agricultural UniversityIndonesia; email: witafar@yahoo.com",,,"Seameo Biotrop",,,,,02156334,,,,"English","Biotropia",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007497792

Peanut kernels of local variety with initial moisture content of 7% were stored in three types of plastic packaging materials under normal oxygen concentration (O 2 concentration before storage was about 21%) and low oxygen concentration (O 2 concentration before storage was about 10%). Samples of peanuts were collected before storage, and subsequently after one, two, three, four and five months of storage. The composition of the three types of plastic packaging materials were OPP30/PE15/ LLDPE80. NY 15/PE15/LLDPE80. and NY 15/PE15/LLDPE70. Their codes were OPP, NY80 and NY70, respectively. The results showed that the moisture contents fluctuated during storage, but they were considered safe for storage (6.5 - 6.9%). The percentage of damaged kernels increased during storage. Total mould population of peanuts packed in the three types of packaging materials (OPP, NY80, and NY70) either under normal (6.7 x 10 3 , 6.7 x 10 3 , and 9.8 x 10 3 cfu/g, respectively) or low oxygen concentration (3.3 x 10 3 , 4.2 x 10 3 , and 2.2 x 10 3 cfu/g, respectively) were not significantly different. After four months of storage, total mould population in peanuts packed either under normal or low oxygen concentration increased. Nevertheless, total mould population in peanuts packed under normal oxygen concentration (7.7 x 10 3 cfu/g) was higher and significantly different from those packed under low oxygen concentration (3.2 x 10 3 cfu/g). Aspergillusflavus population in peanuts packed in the three types of packaging materials cither under normal or low oxygen concentration fluctuated during storage. Aflatoxin B 1 content in peanuts packed under normal oxygen concentration (32.06 ppb) was higher and significantly different from those packed under low oxygen concentration (31.14 ppb). During storage (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 months of storage) aflatoxin B contents in peanuts packed in OPP (18.6, 23.6, 29.0, 32.0, 35.7, and 43.3 ppb, respectively) was lower than those packed either in NY80 (18.8, 25.4, 33.7, 34.1, 40.2, and 42.3 ppb, respectively) or NY70 (19.8, 25.0, 32.2, 32.6, 40.5, and 42.3 ppb, respectively). Infact, the content in OPP after 5 month of storage was higher than that in NY80 or NY70, but based on statistical analyses, they were not significantly different. During storage aflatoxin B 1 contents increased. As total mould population of peanuts packed in the three types of packaging materials were not significantly different, while aflatoxin B 1 content of peanuts packed in OPP was the lowest, consequently OPP is recommended to be used as packaging material to store peanut kernels under low oxygen concentration. © 2017 BIOTROPIA - The Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Biology.","Aflatoxin; Aspergillus flavus; Peanuts; Plastic-packaging materials",,,,,,,,"(2000) Nuts and nut product, , In Horwitz W (ed).

In a few recent years, the exploitation of lola snails has been increasing, so that the population of lola snails in nature decreases.. The yield of lola snail in Saparua Island and in the archipelagos of Banda from 1979 until 1992 showed a decrease from around 4 tons of dry shells to only around 0.25 tons. Furthermore, this research was aimed to estimate the size structure, age structure, and the sex ratio of lola snails population in Saparua Island, the regency of Central Moluccas. The sampling of lola snails used transects strip method. Each transect was 100 m long and 2 m wide, which were divided into 10 segments of 10 m x 2 m. Transect was laid perpendicular to the coast line started from the lowest fall of the tides to the coast. The Bhattacharya method was applied for data analysis. The frequency distribution of shell diameter revealed that lola snails in Saparua Island consisted of nine size classes and two different age classes, which indicated that the population of lola snails in Saparua Island had two periods of spawning. Finally, from this research it could be concluded that the sex ratio of lola snail was 1:1. © 2017 BIOTROPIA - The Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Biology.","Population structure; Saparua Island; Trochus niloticus",,,,,,,,"Arifin, Z., Sebaran geografis, habitat, dan pcrikanan siput Lola (Trochus nilotiais) di Maluku (1993) Journal Fakultas Perikanan Unsrat II, (3), pp. 40-48; Boughey, S.A., (1973) Ecology of Populations, , 2nd Edition.

High temperature is probably the major limiting factor for cultivating the crop in a large scale. This research aims to find out the relationship between temperature and wheat (DWR162 cultivar) crop development to derive its developmental parameters (base temperature and thermal unit) and to further study its effects on grain yield. Experiment was conducted at five locations in Java Island with dis-tinct altitudes range from 28 to 1,650 m to represent a wide range of averaged air tempera-ture (27.5 to 16.5 °C). The base temperatures derived from this experiment were 8.3, 3.8 and 15.1 °C while the parameters of thermal unit were 189, 1053 and 290 d. °C, respectively for the phases of sowing-emergence, emergence-anthesis, and anthesis-physiological matu-rity. Grain yield of the wheat crop decreased with increasing temperature of about 10 % per 1 °C increase above averaged temperature of 16.5 °C. Increasing temperature caused shorter duration during vegetative growth (emergence-anthesis) and grain filling period (anthesis-maturity) which resulted in smaller biomass and the grain yield. © 2017 BIOTROPIA - The Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Biology.","Development; Growth; Indonesia; Temperature; Wheat; Yield",,,,,,"Department of Agriculture

A total of 14 heifers received cloprostenol treatment on Day 9-11 of the cycle to synchronize their estrus. Subsequently, they were divided into two groups, one group which was allowed to undergo spontaneous luteolysis and the other group in which estrus was induced from days 9 to 12. In the induced-group, transrectal ultrasonography were performed daily started two days prior to injection until the onset of estrus. In the spontaneous-group, ultrasonography was done daily from day 15 until the onset of estrus. In both groups scanning were performed every 4 h from the onset of estrus until ovulation was ascertained. Small (SF, 2-4 mm), medium (MF.5-9 mm ) and large (LF, > 9mm) size follicles were recorded. The diameter of largest and subordinate follicles were measured and blood were drawn from jugular vein at approximately around scanning and the plasma were used for measurement of progesterone (P4) and estradiol-17p (E2) concentration. There was no different in term of number of SF, MF and LF (P > 0.05) between the two groups. Similarly, no effect of side (left vs. right ovary) and CL position (ipsi- vs contralateral to the ovary) was found (P > 0.05). However, it was demonstrated that mean number of ovulatory follicles was higher (PO.01) in the spontaneously ovulating group while the regressing-CL size was larger in the cloprostenol induced animals (P < 0.05). Occurrence of time of ovulation in relation to initial signs of estrus was observed in both groups of animals. This variation could be attributed to the existence of a large preovulatory follicle which enhanced the time ovulation. Conversely, when subordinate follicles showed grow up and replace the large follicle the interval from heat to ovulation was prolonged. Progesterone experienced a more steep decrease than the spontaneous group of animals and a positive correlation was observed between the diameter of CL and the P4 concentration. For E2 there was a positive correlation between the E2 and follicular size. It is concluded that the variation in follicular among animals contributed to the variability in timing of ovulation, particularly prostaglandin-induced animals. The diameter of ovulatory follicle in spontaneous group was larger as compared to induced-group. © 2006, Seameo Biotrop.","Cattle reproduction; Cloprostenol; Follicular development; Ovulation",,,,,,,,"Assey, R.J., Purwantara, B., Greve, T., Hyttel, P., Schmidt, M., Corpus luteum size and plasma progesterone levels in cattle after induction of luteolysis (1993) Theriogenology, 39 (6), pp. 1321-1330; Burns, D.S., Jimenez-Krassel, F., Ireland, J.L.H., Knight, P.O., Ireland, J.J., Numbers of antral follicles during follicular waves in cattle: Evidence for high variation among animals, very high repeatability in individuals, and an inverse association with serum follicle-stimulating hormone Concentrations (2005) Biol Reprod, 73 (1), pp. 54-62; Duchens, M., Forsberg, M., Edqvist, L.E., Gustafsson, H., Rodriguez-Martinez, H., Effect of induced suprabasal progesterone levels around estrus on plasma concentrations of progesterone, estradiol-178, and LH in heifers (1994) Theriogenology, 42, pp. 1159-1169; Dufour, J., Whitmore, H.L., Ginther, O.J., Casida, L.E., Identification of the ovulating follicles by its size on different days of estrous cycle in heifers (1972) J.

These fishing grounds are still determined by hunting method. This method is time consuming and costly. However, in many areas determination of fishing ground using satellited data lias been applied by detecting the important oceanographic parameter of the presence of fish schooling such as, sea surface temperature and chlorophyl. Mostly these parameters are used integratedly. The aim of this study is to assess the important oceanographic parameters detected from multi-sensor satellites (NOAA/AVHRR, Seawifs and Topex Poisedon) for determining fishing ground of pelagic tunas in the North Papua waters at east season. The parameters include Sea Surface Temperature (STT), chlorophyl-a and currents. The availability of data from optic sensor (Seawifs: chl-a and AVHRR: Thermal) is limited by the presence of cloud cover. In that case, Topex Poseidon satellite data can be used to provide the currents data. The integration of data from multi-sensors increases the availability of the oceanographic parameters for prediction of the potential fishing zones in the study area. © 2006, Seameo Biotrop.","Chlorophyl-a; Identification; Multi sensors; North Papua-waters; Oceanographic parameter; Pelagic tuna; Sea surface-temperature",,,,,,,,"Dwivedi, R.M., Ocean Colour as a Tool For Potential Fishing Zone Identification and Forecast.

A problem in the cultivation of this seaweed is the ice-ice disease, which is caused by extreme changes in environmental conditions such as temperature and seawater salinity. Gene transformation to produce Cottonii seaweed transgenics that are tolerant to environmental stress is potential solution to this problem. Gα gene encodes for the heterotrimeric G protein α subunit is a gene that plays a role in tolerance to biotic and abiotic environmental stresses. This study aimed to: (a) introduce the Gα gene into callus cells of K. alvarezii and regenerate transformed callus cells to transgenic plantlets; (b) determine the appropriate concentration of acetosyringone and Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain for gene transfer into the callus of K. alvarezii. Callus cells of K. alvarezii were transformed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains LBA4404 and EHA101 carrying the expression vector pGWB502-Gα with a CaMV-35S promoter. The calli and A. tumefaciens were co-cultivated in several concentrations of acetosyringone (20, 40, 60 mg/L). Regeneration of transformed callus cells into transgenic plantlets was successfully performed using the somatic embryogenesis technique. The result showed the highest percentage of putative transgenic micropropagule formation occurred with 20-40 mg/L acetosyringone. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis on twenty transgenic plantlets indicated that the Gα gene was successfully introduced into the genomic DNA of all of them. The transformation using EHA101 produced more transgenic plantlets that were morphologically normal and grew faster in aerated culture than using LBA4404. This study concluded that the appropriate method of gene transfer into K. alvarezii callus was co-cultivation with A. tumefaciens EHA101 in 20-40 mg/L concentration of acetosyringone. © 2019 Seameo Biotrop.","Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Gα gene; Kappaphycus alvarezii; Transgenic plantlets",,,,,,,,"Azanza, R.V., Aliaza, T.T., In vitro carpospore release and germination in Kappaphycus alvarezii (Doty) Doty from Tawi-Tawi, Philippines (1999) Bot Mar, 42, pp. 281-284; Baweja, P., Sahoo, D., Garcia-jimenez, P., Robaina, R.R., Seaweed tissue culture as applied to biotechnology: Problems, achievements and prospects (2009) Phycol Res, 57, pp. 45-58; Berthold, P., Schmitt, R., Mages, W., An engineered Streptomyces hygroscopicus aph 7"" gene mediates dominant resistance against hygromycin B in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (2002) Protist, 153 (4), pp. 401-412; Chakraborty, N., Sharma, P., Kanyuka, K., Pathak, R.R., Choudhury, D., Hooley, R., Raghuram, N., G-protein a-subunit (GPA1) regulates stress, nitrate and phosphate response, flavonoid biosynthesis, fruit/seed development and substantially shares GCR1 regulation in A thaliana (2015) Plant Mol Biol, 89 (6), pp. 559-576; Chen, J.G., Gao, Y., Jones, A.M., Differential roles of Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G-protein subunits in modulating cell division in roots (2006) Plant Physiol, 141, pp. 887-897; Daud, R.F., (2013) Introduksi gen PaCS penyandi sitrat sintase ke dalam rumput laut Kappaphycus alvarezii menggunakan Agrobacterium tumefaciens [tesis], , Bogor (ID).

Discovering potentially selective anticancer agent from plants for the treatment of cervical cancer has become a very challenging area of research worldwide. Our previous study Anredera cordifolia, commonly named as binahong in Indonesia, revealed cytotoxic activity on HeLa cervical cancer cells with IC 50 75 μg/mL. However, the selectivity of the chemical agent and its molecular target has still remained a question. The current study was aimed at investigating the selectivity of ethanolic extract of A. cordifolia leaf (EAC) on Vero cells and its molecular target on HeLa cells. The extracts were prepared by macerating Anredera cordifolia leaf powder in 70% ethanol. The assessment of the viability of Vero cells was carried out using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay; while the cell cycle analysis of HeLa cells was probed by using flow cytometry. Based on the cell cycle analysis, the molecular target of the extract was investigated by immunocytochemical staining. The present study exhibited the selective cytotoxicity of EAC on HeLa cells compared to Vero cells with a Selectivity Index (SI) of 17.36. It arrested cell cycle on G1/S phase and suppressed Bcl-2 expression, anti-apoptotic protein, which also regulates cell cycle. Therefore, the current piece of work endorses the use of EAC as a promising anticancer agent in the treatment of cervical cancer. EAC may be used as a selective anticancer agent on HeLa cells. © 2019 Seameo Biotrop.","Anredera cordifolia; Cytotoxic; HeLa; Selective",,,,,,,,"Ahmadzadeh, A., Shahbazian, H., Safapour, N., Tulabi, M., Zandifar, S., Comparison between the effects of one-day treatment regimen with cisplatin on renal function and various biochemical parameters in patients with gastric and lung cancer compared with two-days divided cisplatin treatment regimen (2015) J Renal Inj Prev, 4 (3), pp. 87-91; Bruni, L., Barrionuevo-Rosas, L., Albero, G., Serrano, B., Mena, M., Gómez, D., Muñoz, J., de Sanjosé, S., ICO Information Centre on HPV and Cancer (HPV Information Centre), , Human Papillomavirus and Related Diseases in the World.

In this research study, the fruticose lichen Ramalina was collected within Guimaras Island, Philippines. A total of 195 specimens were collected and characterized using conventional morphological and chemical analyses. These lichens were identified as Ramalina farinacea, R. roesleri, and R. nervulosa. To test for potential application in agriculture, nine lichen specimens were extracted with acetone and assayed for its inhibitory activities against test bacteria, fungi, and weedy plants. All lichen extracts inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa (>19 mm ZOI) while only seven lichen extracts inhibited Staphylococcus aureus (13-19 mm ZOI). No inhibitory activity was observed against the fungal plant pathogens Fusarium oxysporum, F. solani, F. verticillioides, Colletotrichum capsici, and C. gleosporioides, and the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pectobacterium carotovorum var. carotovorum. Furthermore, there was also a decrease in the root (up to 27% reduction) and shoot (up to 39% reduction) lengths, and leaf chlorophyll content (up to 44% reduction) of Fimbristylis miliacea, Leptochloa chinensis and weedy rice (Oryza sp.). These results, therefore, suggested the potential of lichen extracts from Ramalina as a biological control for weed management. © 2019 Seameo Biotrop.","Antimicrobial; Herbicide; Lichens; Weeds",,,,,,,,"Aptroot, A., Schumm, F., Key to Ramalina species known from Atlantic islands, with two new species from the Azores (2008) Sauteria, 15, pp. 21-57; Aptroot, A., Bungartz, F., The lichen genus Ramalina on the Galapagos (2007) Lichenol, 39 (6), pp. 519-542; Brodo, I.M., Sharnoff, S.D., Sharnoff, S., (2001) Lichens of North America, pp. 620-635. , Italy (ITA): Yale University Press; Candan, M., Yilmaz, M., Tay, T., Kivanç, M., Antimicrobial activity of extracts of the lichen Xanthoparmelia pokornyi and its gyrophoric and stenosporic acid constituents (2006) Z Naturforsch, 49 (1); Candan, M., Yilmaz, M., Tay, T., Erdem, M., TüRk, A.Ö., Antimicrobial activity of extracts of the lichen Parmelia sulcata and its salazinic acid constituent (2007) Z Naturforsch, 62, pp. 619-621; Conchietto, M., Skert, N., Nimis, P.L., Sava, G., A review on usnic acid, an interesting natural compound (2002) Naturwissenschaften, 89, pp. 137-146; Culberson, C.F., Some constituents of the lichen Ramalina siliquosa (1965) Phytochemistry, 4, pp. 951-961; De Jesus, E., Hur, J.S., Notarte, K.I.R., Santiago, K.A.A., dela Cruz, T.E.E., Antibacterial, antioxidant, and cytotoxic activities of the corticolous lichens Canoparmelia aptata, Pannaria sp., and Parmotrema gardneri collected from Mt Banahaw, Quezon, Philippines (2016) Curr Res Environ Appl Mycol, 6 (3), pp. 173-183; Dettki, H., Esseen, P.A., Modeling long-term effects of forest management on epiphytic lichens in northern Sweden (2003) For Ecol Manage, 175, pp. 223-238; Elix, J.A., Stocker-Wörgötter, E., Biochemistry and secondary metabolites (2008) Lichen Biology, pp. 104-133. , In: Nash, T.H.

The rGH was mixed with chicken egg yolk and sprayed on commercial feed with different protein levels (32, 28 and 23%). As control the diets were sprayed with chicken egg yolk without rGH. Striped catfish (body weight: 110,66 ± 1,32 g ind -1 ) were fed on rGH-supplemented diets two times a week (first and third months), and the rest was on diet without rGH supplementation. Fish were reared for 120 days in 18 hapa (2×1×1,5 m 3 ) with initial density of 20 fish. The result showed that the highest weight gain, specific growth rate (SGR), and lowest feed conversion ratio (FCR) were obtained in fish fed on 32% protein content of rGH-supplemented diet. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in weight gain, SGR and FCR in rGH treatment group with 28% protein content of rGH supplemented diet and non-rGH control group receiving 32% protein diet (P &gt; 0.05). Similar moisture content of meat, protein content of meat, belly fat and edible portion were observed in rGH-supplemented diet and their control. Except in treatment 23% protein content rGH supplemented diet has lower lipid content in fish body and meat were found (P &lt; 0.05).

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of M. fragrans essential oil showed that safrole (42.50%) was the major component, followed by 4-terpineol (23.81%) and methyl eugenol (11.14%). At an essential oil concentration of 1000 ppm, the mycelial growth of both Aspergillus strains was significant completely inhibited by vapor treatment but only reduced by about 70% by contact treatment. By contrast, sporulation and aflatoxin B1 production were completely inhibited by both contact and vapor treatment. Vapor treatment induced a higher level of inhibition than contact treatment.

In addition, goats and sheep are important both for agriculture and biomedical research. Even though these small ruminants provide essential goods, there are major obstacles preventing the efficient, sustainable, and profitable production of goats and sheep. This review is significant because it summarizes major challenges facing goat and sheep production, their negative impacts, and specific science-based solutions to overcome them. These challenge areas are education and training, research, translational research/biotechnology, goat and sheep health, and effective/efficient/sustainable/profitable agribusiness. The solutions include effective teaching of goat and sheep science to next generation and empowering the public, supporting and pursuing innovative and translational research, preventing and treating diseases, facilitating technology transfer, and developing sound agribusinesses. This resource is expected to be helpful to scientists, students, and goat and sheep producers. In addition, the information on the current state of goat and sheep agriculture will help the public better understand and appreciate challenges and opportunities in small ruminant production. © 2019 Seameo Biotrop.","Agriculture; Biomedical research; Goat; Sheep; Sustainable production",,,,,,"Indian Council of Agricultural Research, ICAR","This study was funded in part by Mississippi Agricultural Forestry and Experiment Station and by the Animal Biotechnology and Coral Reef Fisheries (ANBIOCORE) Program of the Sustainable Higher Education Research Alliances (SHERA) through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

The purpose of this research is to analyze levels of soil fertility in various land reclamations of PT Bukit Asam South Sumatra determined by microbial population and soil enzyme activity. The results show that soil conditions and soil enzyme activity vary by reclamation age. Urease enzyme activity at KTU with the reclamation age of 12 years is 68.83 mg NH4 +.g-1 dm.h-1 and the microbial population is 82.64 × 104 CFU.g-1. The highest phosphatase enzyme activity on the 9-year SP702 land reclamation is 95.66 mg pNP.g-1 dm.h-1 and soil pH 5.23. The activity of the cellulase enzyme on the 21 years old reclamation field is 21.51 mg GE.g dm.h-1 with the cellulolytic microbial population 1.9 × 104 CFU.g-1 which is higher than other reclamation sites.

Oil palm plantation management requires fertilization into the rhizosphere as nutrient for oil palm growth. The state of total nutrient in rhizosphere can influence enzyme activities. This research was aimed to study the enzyme activities in relationship to nutrient of oil palm rhizospheres in peat. The research was conducted by using the explorative method in tropical peatland of Riau. The research sites chosen were in oil palm plantation as the main site, and a degraded forest and a shrub land, for comparison. In the oil palm plantation, peat samples were taken from the adhered peats on oil palm roots at the peat depths of 0-25 and 25-50 cm and the distances of 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, and 3-4 m from the tree. In the degraded forest and shrub, those samples were taken from selected plant roots at the depth of 0-25 and 25-50 cm. The triplicate peat samples were composited for analysis of enzyme activities and the content of total nutrients. The results showed that enzyme (urease, phosphatase, β-glucosidase, and laccase) activities in oil palm rhizosphere decreased with increasing distance from the tree and the depth of rhizosphere. The decrease of enzyme activities were caused by the low of peat pH and the increase of water content and organic carbon content. Enzyme activities increased with increasing oil palm age and ash content. The content of total nutrients K and Zn showed no correlation with enzyme activities. However, total nutrient of Ca and Mg showed positively correlation only with β-glucosidase activity. The total Fe and Cu contents showed significantly negatively correlation with enzyme activities (urease, phosphatase, β-glucosidase, and laccase). Enzyme activities in the rhizosphere of degraded forest and shrubs was mostly lower than in oil palm rhizosphere. © 2018, Seameo Biotrop.","Enzyme activities; Oil palm; Peatland; Rhizosphere; Total nutrients",,,,,,,,"Almeida, R.F., Naves, E.R., Mota, R.P., Soil quality: Enzymatic activity of soil β-glucosidase (2015) Glob.

To overcome this uncertainty, a two-step mortality model was applied for unthined stands of Acacia mangium species. The model was developed using data from l97 permanent sample plots measured periodically at 1-yr time intervals from 2-4 yrs until 8-11 yrs after planting in South Sumatra, Indonesia. The model consists of two complementary equations. The first equation is a logistic function predicting the probability of mortality incidence depending on stand density, site index and stand age. The second equation estimates the reduction in the number of surviving stems observed in a stand where natural mortality occurs. Nine equations were fitted using data from permanent sample plots where trees died over the time period and the best model was selected. Estimates from this second model are then adjusted by a factor equal to the probability of mortality applying three different approaches: probabilistic two-step, deterministic threshold and stochastic. All methods reveal no significant difference between the observed and the predicted number of surviving stems per ha. The probabilistic two-step approach, however, produces more consistent and the most accurate estimates. This method should provide reliable prediction when it is to be used in forest productivity prediction and management system for the species. © 2018, Seameo Biotrop.","Logistic function; Mangium; Mortality model; Stand density; Survival",,,,,,,,"Alenius, V., Hökkä, H., Salminen, H., Jutras, S., Evaluating estimation methods for logistic regression in modelling individual-tree mortality (2003) Modelling forest systems, pp. 225-236. , Amaro A, Reed D, Soares P, editors.

The objectives of the present study are to determine the effects of rainfall on the distribution of Penaeus monodon Fabricius in the SAL and/or mangroves waters and to explain the cause of the yearly fluctuations in the shrimp catch in this area during 13 years period (1998 -2011). The effects of rainfall on the local distribution and abundance of the shrimp in the SAL, Cilacap, Central Java, Indonesia, were examined for three periods by Anco method: first period (of commercial catch production, 1998 - 2011), second period (December 2010- November 2011) and third period (December 2011 - April 2012), as part of a shrimp fishery and eco-biology study in this region. The marked increase in the rainfall from 557 mm in East Monsoon (June-August) to 1,225 mm in second transition season (September-November) and West Monsoon (December- February) in the Segara Anakan region enhanced the seasonal movement of shrimp into the fishing ground zone IV and produced an initial increase in the abundance of adults (CL > 25 mm) in the region (312 to 2,630 individuals). This initial increase in adult abundance enhances the shrimp reproductive potential and the heavy rainfall indirectly assists the recruitment of young shrimp to the estuary and their growth and survival to increase shrimp abundance in the following year. Lower rainfalls (July- August-September) adversely affect shrimp population and usually result in smaller size of the population (312 individuals). Statistical analysis on relationship between shrimp catch with annual rainfall showed highly significant at 1% level. © 2018, Seameo Biotrop.","Abundance; Distribution; Penaeus monodon; Rainfall; Segara Anakan Lagoon (SAL)",,,,,,,,"Amin, E.M., Hariati, T., The capture fisheries of Segara Anakan, Indonesia (1991) Towards on Integrated Management of Tropical Coastal Resources, pp. 51-56. , In: L.M.

Unfortunately, there were many fires in peatlands. In Kalimantan, peatland fires which are characterized by hotspot occurrences reached an average of 25.1% in this decade. According to experts and field forest fire fighters, fire hotspots that appear in a sequence of two to three days at the same location has a high potential of becoming a forest fire. This study aims to determine the sequential patterns of hotspots occurrence, classify satellite image data and identify the fire spot. Fire spot identification was done using hotspots sequences patterns that were overlaid with burned area classification results. Sequential pattern mining using the Prefix Span algorithm was applied to identify sequences of hotspot occurrence. Meanwhile, classification using Maximum Likelihood method was applied to satellite image Landsat 7 to identify burned areas in Pulang Pisau and Palangkaraya Central Kalimantan and Pontianak in West Kalimantan. Furthermore, sequence patterns were overlaid with image classification results. The results show that in Pulang Pisau, 26.19% of sequences patterns are located in burned areas and 72.62% sequence patterns are in the buffer of burned area within a radius of one kilometer. As for Palangkaraya, there are 62.50% sequences patterns are located in burned areas and 87.50% sequence patterns are in the buffer of burned area with the radius of one kilometer. It is concluded that in Pulang Pisau and Palangkaraya there are respectively 72.62% and 87.50% fire hotspots which are strong indicators of peatland fires. © 2018, Seameo Biotrop.","Fire spot identification; Hotspot; Maximum likelihood; Prefix Span; Sequential pattern mining",,,,,,,,"Canty, M.J., (2010) Image Analysis, Classification, and Change Detection in Remote Sensing, , 2th Edition.

The highest abundance of benthic diatoms was found in the Ping River (143 species), followed by Mae Hao (132 species) and Mae Luang Streams (90 species), respectively. The most abundant species found in the Ping River were Planothidium lanceolatum, Nitzschia palea, Navicula cryptotenella and Seminavis strigosa. The most abundant species found in the Mae Hao Stream were Nitzschia palea, Seminavis strigosa, Surirella splendida and Sellaphora pupula. The most abundant species found in the Mae Luang Stream were Navicula cryptotenella, Diadesmis contenta, Karayevia oblongella and Achnanthes brevipes. Additionally, Amphipleura lindheimeri Grunow was identified as a newly recorded species for Thailand. This study determined that the Ping River and Mae Hao Stream were similar bodies of water when compared with the Mae Luang Stream in terms of benthic diatom diversity and water quality. In addition, indicator species of tolerance and sensitivity to organic pollution were found. © 2018, Seameo Biotrop.","Amphipleura lindheimeri; Cluster analysis; Diversity index; Water quality",,,,,,,,"Almeida, S.F.P., Craveiro, S.C., Calado, A.J., On the identity and distribution in northern Portugal of three Gomphonema species currently misidentified as Gomphonema clevei (2010) Diatom Res, 25 (1), pp. 13-27; Eaton, A.D., Clesceri, L.S., Rice, E.W., Greenberg, A.E., Franson, M.A.H., Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, , 1 edition. 1 st Washington DC: American Public Health Association (APHA); Guiry, M.D., Guiry, G.M., (2017) 'AlgaeBase': Worldwide electronic publication, , www.algaebase.org, National University of Ireland, Galway, [updated 2017 April 25 cited 2017 March 12]; Hammer, Ø., Harper, D.A.T., Ryan, P.D., PAST: Paleontological statistics software package for education and data analysis (2001) Palaeontol Electron, 4 (1), pp. 1-9; Kelly, M.G., Haworth, E.Y., Phylum Bacillariophyta (2002) The Fresh Water Algae Flora of the British Isles: An Identfication Guide to Freshwater and Terrestrial Algae, pp. 273-277. , John DM, Whitton BA, Brook AJ.

This study was conducted to find out the effect of photoperiod on hard-lipped barb reproductive performance by manipulating photoperiod. Experiments were designed with three photoperiod treatments, namely 14L:10D (control), 8L:16D (short photoperiods) and 18L:6D (long photoperiods). Four aquaria consisting of nine fishes each were served as replicates. Fishes were kept under these photoperiods for 8 weeks. The observed variable was the liver activities evaluated by measuring gene expression of Vitellogenin. The normalized data were subjected to ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple-comparison tests. The length of cDNA Vitellogenin was 1136 bp. The vitellogenin precursors encoded cDNA consisted of 378 amino acids. The average of vitellogenin gene in each experimental group significantly increased according to longer photoperiods (P < 0.05), and the highest vitelogenin gene expression was in Long Photoperiods (LP, 18Light: 6 dark). These results indicated that photoperiods had a stimulatory effect in improving hard-lipped barb reproductive performance. © 2018, Seameo Biotrop.","Amino acid; CDNA; Hard-lipped barb; Photoperiods; Vitellogenin",,,,,,"Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Tinggi, DIKTI","This project was funded by-DIKTI (International Research Collaboration 2016).

Estuary is a semi-enclosed water, that can be influenced by pollution from land areas or rivers. This research was aimed to determine the spatial distribution of water pollution levels based on BOD5 analysis. This research was conducted in January and February 2016 in Suwung estuary, Bali. Samples were taken in 20 points (19 points were located in Suwung Estuary and one point was located outside the Suwung estuary as a control point) and the BOD5 samples were analyzed in the laboratory. The method for BOD5 analysis was using amperometric method in National Field Manual for the Collection of Data Water-Quality, Chapter A7. The BOD5 Samples were taken at all tide cycles, during ebb to high tide and high tide to ebb. The range of BOD5 values were: 0.84 mg/L - 9.47 mg/L during ebb to high tide and 0.96 mg/L - 8.75 mg/L during high tide to ebb. The result of BOD5 analysis showed that the water pollution level in the Suwung estuary was slightly contaminated in both tide conditions.

Because of their hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties, they have potency to reduce surface tension, interfacial tension between water-hydrocarbon systems, and low micelle concentration. Their characteristics strongly depend on the producer strain as well as on the medium composition, such as carbon and nitrogen sources. This study was conducted to investigate the influence of different sources of carbon (n-hexadecane, glycerol and glucose) and nitrogen (urea, NH4 Cl and NaNO3 ) for the production of biosurfactants by a new strain of 4 3 Pseudomonas aeruginosa B031 isolated from a rhizosphere of Paraserianthes falcataria L. Nielsen, a hardwood plant species at a phytoremediation field. The biosurfactant characteristics of the strain were evaluated, particularly its surface-active properties and potential to remove hydrocarbon. Glycerol was found to be the optimum carbon source, with rhamnose concentration, emulsification index, and critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 718 mg/L, 37%, and 35 mN/m, respectively. Sodium nitrate (NaNO3 ) was observed as the optimum nitrogen source, with rhamnose 3 concentration, emulsification index, and CMC of 290 mg/L, 30%, and 24 mN/m, respectively. These biosurfactants efficiently reduced surface tension of culture broth from 42 mN/m to 31 mN/m for the glycerol treatment and from 37 mN/m to 24 mN/m for the sodium nitrate treatment. The crude biosurfactants from the glycerol and sodium nitrate treatments also removed 87.5% and 84%, respectively, of crude oil from sand. These rates were higher than those of the chemical surfactants (SDS and Triton X-100). These findings indicate that the biosurfactants produced by the strain from both glycerol and NaNO3 treatments can efficiently decrease the interfacial tension of culture broth 3 dilution and have a high emulsion index, thus hold promise in hydrocarbon bioremediation application. © 2018, Seameo Biotrop.","Bioremediation;

This study was conducted to evaluate growth performance and enzyme activity in catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus). Diet with five different levels of water hyacinth subtitute of pollard (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) were fed to catfish for 60 days. Seventy (70) catfish fry with average initial body weight of 2.45±0.15 g were maintained in 100cm x 80cm x 60cm aquaria. Fish fed at satiation level three times daily at 8 am, 12 pm, and 4 pm. With dietary of 25% water hyacinth, growth performance and protease activity similar to 0% treatment. Feed intake, protein digestibility, feed efficiency, protein efficiency ratio, and protease and amylase enzyme activities decreased (p < 0.05) in those fed with more than 25% water hyacinth. Catfish fed 25% water hyacinth showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher daily growth rate, feed efficiency and protein digestibility than those with other treatments. Based on the growth performance and enzyme activity, we can conclude that the optimum dietary level of water hyacinth subtitute pollard for fry catfish is 25%. © 2018, Seameo Biotrop.","Catfish; Growth performance;

These bacteria have unique social behaviors by forming fruiting bodies, moving by gliding motility and preying on other microorganisms. The research was conducted to isolate, characterize, and identify indigenous myxobacteria from Sumba and Papua Islands of Indonesia as a preliminary step to utilize their potential in the pharmaceutical industry. Myxobacteria were isolated using filter paper and baiting with Escherichia coli to obtain cellulolytic and bacteriolytic myxobacteria, respectively. Characterization of myxobacteria was performed with Gram staining, observation on pigmentation, morphology of vegetative cells, fruiting bodies, and myxospores. Molecular identification was conducted based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. A total of 10 myxobacterial strains were successfully isolated and purified. All isolates obtained were Gram negative, rod shaped with yellow or orange pigmentation. Fruiting bodies observed contained spherical myxospores.

In previous studies, specific pathogen resistant (SPR), A. hydrophila-resistant African catfish first generation (F1) has been cultivated by marker assisted selection using the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1 as a molecular marker. In this study, growth performance, inheritance of the MHC DNA marker in the second generation (F2) of catfish and disease resistance against A. hydrophila infection were observed. The F2 progenies were produced by crossing F1 fish between themselves. Nursery was performed in 80-L glass aquaria, 4 replications for each cross, at the same initial density, for 2 months of rearing. The results showed that daily growth rate of F2 progenies from the SPR broods was significantly higher than those from broods without the marker. Results of the PCR analysis showed that average number of F2 progenies from SPR broods carrying the MHC marker was about 91% higher than that of control. After the fish 6 reached about 12 cm body length, they were challenged by intramuscularly injecting of 0.1 mL A. hydrophila (LD50: 106 CFU ml-1) for 7 days. Results of challenge test showed that survival of F2 offspring from the crosses of SPR broods (77.2%) was about two times higher than those from brood without MHC marker (38.3%). Differential leukocyte count supported the high resistance of F2 progenies from F1 broods having MHC I marker against A. hydrophila infection. In conclusion, African catfish farming carrying MHC marker potentially have higher productivity and reduces fish lose due to infection by A. hydrophila. © 2018, Seameo Biotrop.","Aeromonas hydrophila; African catfish; Disease resistance; Growth; MHC I",,,,,,,,"Alimuddin, M., Santika, A., Carman, O., Faizal, I., Sumantadinata, K., Identification of the Majalaya common carp strain resistance to KHV infection using Cyca-DAB1*05 allele as a marker (2011) Indonesian Aquaculture Journal, 6 (2), pp. 157-163; (2005) Standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater, , http://www.mwa.co.th/download/file_upload/SMWW_1000-3000.pdf, [Internet].

Land over exploitation and development activities in West Kalimantan of Indonesia necessitated the focus of this research which aims to analyzing and predicting land use changes in West Kalimantan. The results of such a study assist researchers, planners and policy makers to formulate suitable land use policies in the future in order to balance economic development and natural resource conservation. Moreover, it makes Indonesia shift from middle incomes to become a developed country in 2030. Methodology employs field observation, key informant interviews, focus group discussions and system dynamics modeling. The field observation covered communities in several locations in the study site to identify pattern of land use. The system dynamics was applied to analyze the land use change system and estimate the extents of land cover change in the future. The study showed several outcomes: (i) The main leverage factors in the land use change system in West Kalimantan were the desire to reach the expected economic growth and the increased per capita consumption of edible oil globally; (ii) In the business as usual modeling, the increasing global demand for edible oil will lead to significant increment of oil palm plantation area, even the total area of plantation could be wider compare to that of the remaining forest area by 2030; (iii) Key interventions that need to be considered in the future is to conduct reforestation (with reforestation rate of at least 0.5% per year) and limited oil palm plantation development to maximum of 50% of developed area. © 2018, Seameo Biotrop.","Agroforestry; Land use; Oil palm development; System dynamics; West Kalimantan",,,,,,"Universitas Indonesia, UI","This research was partially supported by Forum Orangutan Indonesia (Orangutan Indonesia Forum).

Currently, molecular approach based on 16S rDNA is widely used for bacterial identification. This approach is however, time consuming and expensive. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) allows the identification of microorganisms directly from colonies and it only takes some few minutes. The interest of this study was to identify endophytic bacteria associated with Curcuma zedoaria based on protein profile using MALDI-TOF MS system and compare with 16S rDNA sequence results. Endophytic bacteria were isolated from part of medicinal plant C. zedoaria collected from Bogor, West Java Indonesia. The identification of selected bacteria was performed by protein profile using MALDI-TOF MS. A total of 66 endophytic bacteria from C. zedoaria plant, were selected for identification. The result of MALDI-TOF MS analysis showed that eleven isolates (16.67%) were correctly identified to the species level and 23 isolates (34.85%) matched on genus level of molecular approach. These results demonstrates that the MALDI-TOF system is suitable and feasible approach for the bacterial identification, mainly for screening and grouping of large number isolates. © 2018, Seameo Biotrop.","Curcuma zedoaria;

In-situ study of seedling abundance and growth performance of these Dipterocarp species was conducted in two selected peat swamp forests of Brunei Darussalam, following a mast fruiting event in March-May 2014. Within six 6 x 6 m plots at each forest site, D. rappa seedlings at the Anduki peat swamp forest and S. albida seedlings at the Badas peat swamp forest were measured for abundance at the initial census in September 2014, as well as survival and relative growth rates (RGR) after a period of 5 months, with the final census in February 2015. We found significantly higher seedling abundance for D. rappa (1885 ± 208) than S. albida (160 ± 71). Significantly higher percentage survival was recorded for D. rappa seedlings (90.8 ± 2.2%) in comparison to S. albida seedlings (81.7 ± 2.2%). S. albida seedlings (0.24 ± 0.02 mm mm-1 month-1 ) showed significantly greater RGR in stem diameter than D. rappa seedlings (0.18 ± 0.02 mm mm-1 month-1 ), however, there were no significant differences in the RGRs based on seedling height, leaf number and biomass between D. rappa and S. albida seedlings. In terms of seedling abundance and percentage survival, D. rappa seedlings appeared to be more successful in regeneration and may potentially be used for rehabilitation of degraded tropical peat swamps and other forest types. Our results suggested that greater conservation efforts of peat swamps must be made to protect the Bornean endemic plant species, in particular S. albida. © 2018, Seameo Biotrop.","Borneo; Dipterocarpaceae; Dryobalanops rappa; Relative growth rates; Shorea albida",,,,,,,,"Anderson, J.A.R., (1963) The flora of the peat swamp forests of Sarawak and Brunei, including a catalogue of all recorded species of flowering plants, ferns and fern allies, pp. 131-228. , Singapore (SG): Gard.

Land degradation and illegal capture of hornbills (a distributor of A. titanum seeds) is leading to potential extinction of A. titanum in the wild. In order to conserve the species and save it from extinction, there is an urgent need to develop methods to propagate it both in situ and ex situ. The aim of this research was to discover environmental factors triggering callus growth from petiole cuttings of A. titanum in its natural habitat in Sumatera and to determine the viability of callus pieces as a propagation material. A completely randomized design with a single factor, i.e., callus size, was employed on five callus replicates. Each 2 replicate consisted of four callus samples. The treatments consisted of three callus piece sizes i.e. 0.5 x.0.5 cm2, 1 x 1 cm2, 2 x 2 cm2. For each replicate, the following parameters of growth were assessed: the time of appearance of shoots; the shoot height when the first leaf fully opened; the petiole diameter; the diameter of the leaf lamina; and the number of young shoots. The results of our field observations showed that environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil influence the formation of the callus in the wild. The size of the callus affected the shoot and root growth. The best result was obtained from callus 2 cm2, which could produce 2-3 shoots with an average height of 18.8 cm at the time of first fully opened leaf. The collection of petiole calluses of A. titanum that formed in its natural habitat are recommended instead of carrying the tuber.This ex vitro calluses can be used as propagation materials and then it could be planted in the botanic gardens as one of ex situ conservation effort. © 2018, Seameo Biotrop.","Amorphophallus titanum; Ex situ conservation; Ex vitro propagation; Petiole callus; Sumatera",,,,,,,,"Boyce, P.C.A., Sookchaloem, D., Hetterscheid, W.L.A., Gusman, G., Jacobsen, N.G., Idei, T., Du, N.V., Araceae.

Blume is one of Indonesian natural orchid which has an aesthetic flower and possesses high economic value. The low multiplication rate and long periods of life cycle are the main obstacles to conventionally propagate this orchid. The aims of this research were to analyze the stability of transgenic plant P. amabilis harboring 35S::KNAT1 based on morpho-genomic characterization. KNAT1 gene is reported as a gene that involved in the shoot formation, and it had been successfully introduced into Phalaenopsis amabilis (L.) Blume genome. After seven times regeneration, the confirmation of the transgene existence in the genom is needed to ensure whether the plant could consistently maintain the transgene in its genome and to characterize the shoot development. The experiment was carried out in 3 steps: 1) Co-integration analysis of 35S::KNAT1 into P. amabilis genom; 2) Phenotypic analysis on the multiplication rate, morphological variation and venation pattern; and 3) Protein profile analysis of transgenic plants. The results showed that the survival rate of putative transgenic was 58.7% on NP0 medium and 62.5% on NP SIM medium. PCR analysis confirmed that 82.5% transgenic growth on NP0 and 93.33% on NP SIM contained DNA fragment of KNAT1 gene, NPTII gene and trnL-F intergenic spacer, indicating that those plants are positive transgenic. The 35S::KNAT1 transgenes and phytohormone were independently involved in multishoots formation of P. amabilis transgenic plants. The phenotypic of plantlets were classified into six main criteria, i.e. normal shape, lobed leaves, rosette, elongated stem, cup shoot and widened leaves. The normal type was the most abundant type of variation (± 29%) in both medium. Protein profile showed that all transgenic plants produced 45,8 kDa protein and that was equivalent with molecular weight of KNAT1 protein. Taken together, all those data indicated that 35S::KNAT1 transgene were consistently integrated into the transgenic plant genome. © 2018, Seameo Biotrop.","35S::KNAT1 (Knotted-Like Arabidopsis thaliana 1); Multishoots; Phalaenopsis amabilis; Transgene",,,,,,,,"Berleth, T., Jürgens, G., The role of the monopteros gene in organising the basal body region of the Arabidopsis embryo (1993) Development, 118, pp. 575-587; Bolduc, N., Hake, S., The maize transcription factor KNOTTED1 directly regulates the gibberellin catabolism gene GA2OX1 (2009) The Plant Cell Preview, pp. 1-12; Byrne, M.E., Barley, R., Curtis, M., Arroyo, J.M., Dunham, M., Hudson, A., Martienssen, R.A., Asymmetric leaves1 mediates leaf patterning and stem cell function in Arabidopsis (2000) Nature, 408, pp. 967-971; Chuck, G., Lincoln, C., Hake, S., KNAT1 induced lobed leaves with ectopic meristem when overexpressed in Arabidopsis (1996) Plant Cell, 8, pp. 1277-1289; Dressler, R.L., (1981) The orchid: Natural history and classification, , Harvard (US): Harvard University press; Frugis, G., Giannino, D., Mele, G., Nicolodi, C., Chiappetta, A., Bitonti, M.B., Mariotti, D., Over-expression of KNAT1 in lettuce shift leaf determinate growth to a shoot-like indeterminate growth associated with an accumulation of isopentenyl type cytokinins (2001) Plant Physiol, 126, pp. 1370-1380; Hasan, S., Prakash, J., Vashishtha, A., Sharma, A., Srivastava, K., Sagar, F., Mishra, S., Optimization of DNA extraction from seeds and leaf tissues of Chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum indicum) for polymerase chain reaction (2012) Bioinformation, 8 (5), pp. 225-228; Hay, A., Kaur, H., Phillips, A., Hidden, P., Hake, S., The gibberellin pathway mediates Knotted1-Type Homeobox function in plants with different body plans (2002) Curr Biol, 12, pp. 1557-1565; Higuchi, M., Pischke, M.S., Mahonen, A.P., Miyawaki, K., Hashimoto, Y., Seki, M., Kakimoto, T., In planta functions of the Arabidopsis cytokinin receptor family (2004) PNAS, 101, pp. 8821-8826; Holme, D.J., Peck, H., (1998) Analytical biochemistry, , third edition.

Those are essential in the study of the revegetation effectiveness. However, the growth strategies of plant species in various types of habitats have not yet been fully investigated. The objective of this study was to investigate the growth strategies of ten woody plant species which were naturalized from mangrove to lowland habitats in relation to their effectiveness for revegetation program. The seedling's growth was recorded during 4 months in Purwodadi Botanic Garden-LIPI from October 2014 to February 2015. Complete randomized design with plant species as a treatment using 3 replications was carried out to examine the plant's Relative Growth Rates (RGRs), their components, leaf nitrogen productivity and growth strategies.The study showed that RGRs of ten woody plants species varied across species. Based on the Pearson correlations, the plant's Net Assimilation Rates (NAR) and two ecological traits related to the root trait i.e. Nitrogen productivity and Specific Root Length (SRL) were strongly correlated with the RGRs. Heritiera littoralis, Diospyros discolor, Antidesma bunius, Schleichera oleosa, Madhuca longifolia and Syzygium cumini have high RGRs but low Specific Leaf Area (SLA). B. asiatica has relatively low RGRs and SLA, while Dracontomelon dao have high RGRs and SLA. It showed that most of plant species studied, except D. dao achieve growth rates and competitiveness by developing strategies through forming fine roots to maximize its ecological function in nutrients uptake. Most of woody plant species are adaptive to dry lowland habitat and only D. dao potentially occupy the ecosystem. Furthermore, D. discolor and S. oleosa are highly recommended for revegetation in degraded tropical lowland areas. © 2018, Seameo Biotrop.","Growth strategy; Revegetation; RGR; Root trait; Woody plants",,,,,,,,"Álvarez-Sánchez, J., Sánchez-Gallen, I., Guadarrama, P., Analyses of ecophysiological traits of tropical rain forest seedlings under arbuscular mycorrhization: Implications in ecological restoration (2009) Symbiotic Fungi: Principles and Practice, pp. 293-305. , Varma A, Kharkwal AC, editors.

The plant produces white edible corm; and it was used as food during famine time before 1960s. Rapid ecological changes and land fragmentations in Java in recent times threaten populations of A. variabilis. Here, compound microsatellite markers were developed in order to develop conservation strategies in the populations. Twelve primers pairs produced high polymorphism ranging from 5 to 22 alleles per locus. The observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.191 to 0.851 and 0.380 to 0.943, respectively. This high allelic diversity indicates that these markers are suitable for the study on population genetic structure. Cross-amplification on related and nonrelated species was performed. Application of the markers on populations from Dramaga Conservation Forest revealed high allelic richness, high diversity within and among populations. Genetic distance among populations increased with an increase of geographic distance. Present study suggested that, it is important to study population of A. variabilis in Java in order to understand the population genetic structure and develop effective in situ conservation programs. © 2018, Seameo Biotrop.","Araceae; Genetic population; SSR; Tuber crop; White iles-iles",,,,,,,,"Abdul-Muneer, P.M., Application of microsatellite markers in conservation genetics and fisheries management: Recent advance in population structure analysis and conservation strategies (2014) Genet Res Inter nat, 2014, p. 691759; Alonso-Sande, M., Teijeiro-Osorio, D., Remuñán-López, C., Alonso, M.J., Glucomannan, a promising polysaccharide for biopharmaceutical purposes (2009) Eur J Pharm Biopharm, 72, pp. 453-462; Csencsics, D., Brodbeck, S., Holderegger, R., Costeffective, species-specific microsatellite development for the endangered dwarf bulrush (Typia minima) using next-generation sequencing technology (2010) J.

The impacts of light color on fatty acid production and biosynthesis in microalgae are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of light color on growth and fatty acid content in Chlorella strain KS-MA2. Cells were cultured on F/2 medium and incubated under blue, green, red or white light. The cells' growth, fatty acid composition and the expression levels of the ketoacyl synthase 1 (KAS-1), omega-6 desaturase (ω-6 FAD) and omega-3 desaturase (ω-3 FAD) genes were measured at the early stationary growth phase. Results of this study indicated that light color affected cell density and fatty acid profile produced by Chlorella sp. strain KS-MA2. Cells cultured under blue, red and white light had higher cell density than those cultured under green light. Palmitic acid (38.62 ± 3.29% of biomass dry weight) and linolenic acid (7.96 ± 0.88% of biomass dry weight) were highly accumulated under white light. Stearic acid was dominant under blue light (11.11 ± 0.14% of biomass dry weight), whereas oleic acid was dominant under red light (30.50 ± 0.14% of biomass dry weight). Linoleic acid was highly produced under green and blue light (28.63 ± 1.36% and 26.00 ± 0.81 % of biomass dry weight, respectively). KAS-1 and ω-6 FAD were highly expressed under blue light, whereas ω-3 FAD was highly expressed under green light. The production of particular fatty acids of interest from Chlorella could be achieved by shifting color of light used during the incubation of the cell cultures. Blue-light is the most suitable light color for producing biomass and stearic acid by Chlorella strain KS-MA2. © 2018, Seameo Biotrop.","Light spectrum; Linoleic acid; Linolenic acid; Oleic acid; Palmitic acid; Stearic acid",,,,,,,,"Abu-Ghosh, S., Fixler, D., Dubinsky, Z., Iluz, D., Flashing light in microalgae biotechnology (2016) Bioresour Technol, 203, pp. 357-363; Cha, T.S., Chen, J.W., Goh, E.G., Aziz, A., Loh, S.H., Differential regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis in two Chlorella species in response to nitrate treatments and the potential of binary blending microalgae oils for biodiesel application (2011) Bioresour Technol, 102, pp. 10633-10640; Cheirsilp, B., Torpee, S., Enhanced growth and lipid production of microalgae under mixotrophic culture condition: Effect of light intensity, glucose concentration and fed-batch cultivation (2012) Bioresour Technol, 110, pp. 510-516; Chen, T., Liu, J., Guo, B., Ma, X., Sun, P., Liu, B., Chen, F., Light attenuates lipid accumulation while enhancing cell proliferation and starch synthesis in the glucosefed oleaginous Chlorella zofingiensis (2015) Sci Rep, 5, p. 14936; Choi, C.Y., Kim, N.N., Shin, H.S., Park, H.G., Cheon, S.G., Kil, G.S., The effect of various wavelengths of light from light-emitting diodes on the antioxidant system of marine cyanobacteria, Synechococcus sp (2013) Mol Cell Toxicol, 9 (3), pp. 295-302; Costa, B.S., Jungandreas, A., Jakob, T., Weisheit, W., Mittag, M., Wilhelm, C., Blue light is essential for high acclimation and photo protection in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum (2013) J Exp Bot, 64 (2), pp. 483-493; Das, P., Lei, W., Siti-Sarah, A., Obbard, J.P., Enhanced algae growth in both phototrophic and mixotrophic culture under blue light (2011) Bioresour Technol, 101, pp. 3883-3887; Ge, Z., Zhang, H., Zhang, Y., Yan, C., Zhao, Y., Purifying synthetic high-strength wastewater by microalgae Chlorella vulgaris under various light emitting diode wavelengths and intensities (2013) J Environ Health Sci Engineering, 11 (8), pp. 1-10; George, B., Pancha, I., Desai, C., Chokshi, K., Paliwal, C., Ghosh, T., Mishra, S., Effects of different media composition, light intensity and photoperiod on morphology and physiology of freshwater microalgae Ankistrodesmus falcatus: A potential strain for bio-fuel production (2014) Bioresour Technol, 171, pp. 367-374; Guillard, R.R.L., Ryther, J.H., Studies of marine planktonic diatoms.

Salinity intrusion and industrial wastewater contamination are the main cause of environmental degradation in soil ecosystem. This research was aimed to determine a link between biochemical soil properties and land use types to provide suitable solutions for afforestation and soil restoration. Soil sampling was conducted in five different land use types at four soil layers (O, AB, Bj and Cp). The five land use types were sugarcane crop; Melaleuca plantation; 2-year Acacia plantation; 5-year Acacia plantation; and control (grass-covered land). The results showed that soil in those five land use types were very acidic (pH ≤ 4) having poor-nutrient condition with range of orthophosphate content of 378 - 640 mg/kg, N-NH of 586 - 999 mg/kg and N-NO of 830 - 1,112 mg/kg. 4 3 Concentration of toxic ions was very high with large variation among land use types and soil depths i.e. 1,799 - 12,403 mg SO4 2/kg;22 - 1,645 mg exchangeable Fe/kg and 34 - 88 mg Al3+/kg soil. The lowest concentration of exchangeable 4 3+ 2- Fe and SOSO4 2 ions were found in sugarcane and Melaleuca plantations, respectively. Twenty-three sulfur-oxidizing 4 bacteria and two iron-oxidizing bacteria were identified. All these bacteria were initially identified as Thiobacillus sp. Sugarcane and Melaleuca plantations exhibited the most diverse Thiobacillus species which linked to reduction of 2- exchangeable Fe and SO concentrations in these two land use types. This study indicated that Thiobacillus sp. could 4 grow well in the Thionic Fluvisols. It is proposed that Melaleuca and sugarcane species could reduce iron and sulfur contents in Thionic Fluvisols in the tropics.","Acacia; Acid sulfate soil; Melaleuca; sugarcane; Thiobacillus sp.; Thionic Fluvisols",,,,,,,"The authors thank Ho Chi Minh People Committee's Department of Forestry and Forest Science Institute of South Vietnam for providing financial support for this study.","Araragi, M., Tangcham, B., Effect of rice straw on the composition of volatile sod gas and microflora in the tropical paddy field (1979) J Plant Nutr Soil Sci, 25, pp. 283-295; Bertsch, B., (1996) Aluminum: methods of soil analysis Part 3-chemical methods., pp. 517-550. , Madison (US): Soil Sci Soc of America Inc; Brady, N.C., Well, R.R., (2002) The nature and properties of soils, , New Jersey (US): Prentice Hall Inc; Breemen, V., Environmental aspects of acid sulfate soils.

Similar instances of Ageratina adenophora invasion have been reported. This study was aimed to determine the effect of A. adenophora invasion on species richness, species or community composition and occurrence frequency of soil fungi. These parameters were analyzed using culture method on invaded and uninvaded soils. Species richness of soil fungi was lower in the A. adenophora invaded soil compared to the uninvaded soil. The occurrence frequency of particular fungi was different for those two soil conditions. A. adenophora also altered soil fungi species composition in the invaded soil by replacing saprophytic fungi and accumulating pathogenic fungi. Thus, A. adenophora is associated to lower species richness of saprophytic soil fungi and high occurrence frequency of pathogenic soil fungi. This study concluded that the invasive A. adenophora modifies belowground soil fungi communities as one of the mechanisms involved in the successful invasion of A. adenophora.","Belowground modification; Soil fungi; Species composition; Species richness",,,,,,,,"Abildgren, M.P., Lund, F., Thrane, U., Elmholt, S., Czapek-Dox agar containing iprodione and dicloran as a selective medium for the isolation of Fusarium species (1987) Lett Appl Microbiol, 5 (4), pp. 83-86; Aneja, K., (2003) Experiments in microbiology, plant pathology and biotechnology, , New Delhi (IN): New Age International (P) Ltd; Barnett, H.L., Hunter, B.B., (1960) Illustrated genera of imperfect fungi, , Minneapolis (US): Burgess Publishing Company; Benson, H.J., Bacterial population counts (2002) Microbiological applications, p. 87. , New York (US): McGraw Hill Company; Bever, J.D., Dickie, I.A., Facelli, E., Facelli, J.M., Klironomos, J., Moora, M., .

This study demonstrated the effect of different culture parameters in protease and cellulase production using two different bacterial strains. Results of this study clearly indicated the importance of different parameters such as moisture content, pH, incubation temperature, incubation period, inoculum size, carbon sources and nitrogen sources in enzyme production. The most critical parameters affecting the enzymes production were pH, temperature, carbon and nitrogen sources. Further investigations are required to enhance the enzymes production using genetic engineering.","Bacterial strains; Culture parameters; Product maximization; Protease and cellulase",,,,,,"University Grants Commission","We are very much thankful to University Grants Commission (UGC), New Delhi, for financial support.

However, only several studies focused on the effect of logging in the forest ecosystem. This research was aimed to analyze recovery processes of the forest ecosystem. The research was conducted in the logged tropical rainforest in South Papua using ecological approach which used tree communities as biotic and soil condition as abiotic indicators. Data were collected in the logging area of PT Tunas Timber Lestari located in the tropical rainforest of South Papua. There were five groups of forests used in this research i.e. unlogged, one year post selectively-logged, five years post selectively-logged, ten years post selectively-logged and fifteen years post selectively-logged forests. Thirty nested plots were laid on each forest group. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was applied to analyze the understory and upperstory plant communities. Understory and upperstory plant communities formed different patterns due to logging. Plant communities in the ten and fifteen years post-selectively logged forests were not similar to those in the unlogged forest. Soil organic matter (SOM) content in the selectively logged forests was lower than that in the unlogged forest. These occurrences indicated that the selectively logged forests were still recovering and required more than fifteen years to be fully recovered.","Canonical correspondence analysis; Edaphic factor; Logged tropical forest; Plant community; Soil organic matter",,,,,,,"The research was funded by Beasiswa Pendidikan Pascasarjana Dalam Negeri (BPP-DN) 2014, Manokwari Regency and West Papua Province.

The maps were established based on a model developed in 1998 by the then Indonesia Department of Forestry. The model has 2 weaknesses i.e. 1. high level of uncertainty due to vector-based data used to build the thematic maps and 2. parameters redundancy or duplication from the model. This research was aimed to build up a proposed model on levels of degraded land at Merawu Watershed using fully raster-based data supported with remote sensing and GIS techniques. Parameters analyzed were Slope, Erosivity (R), Erodibility (K), Slope Length and Steepness (LS), Cover and Management (C), Support Practice (P) and Percentage of Canopy Cover. These data were presented in fully raster format. Management parameter was not explicitly used in this research because management parameter was already represented by the C and P parameters. Five parameters were directly obtained using fully raster format, i.e. Slope, LS, C, P and Percentage of Canopy Cover. The other 2 parameters went through spatial interpolation process before being presented as fully raster format. Correlation analysis among parameters was carried out. Parameters having high correlation coefficient (r = 0.8) were excluded from the model to avoid redundancy. The proposed model only used parameters having low correlation coefficient. The research result showed that the determination of levels of degraded land was more accurate when using only erosion parameters, formulated as: Level of Degraded Land (LoDL) ≈ Erosion ≈ R x K x LS x C x P.","Degraded land; GIS; Raster; Remodel; Remote sensing",,,,,,,"The authors thank the Indonesian Directorate General of Higher Education for providing grant to conduct this research.","Abdurachman, A.S., (2002) Soil erosion control technology.

The study was aimed at providing details of pollen presentation system, pollination syndrome, pollinators and seed dispersal mode for L. mollis based mostly on field study. Paper chromatography technique was used for recording sugar and amino acid types in the nectar, since they are important to evaluate the pollination syndrome. The study indicated that L. mollis flowers during August-November. The plant produces synflorescences consisting of several capitula. Each capitulum produces a single disc floret. The plant is protandrous, temporally dioecious and exhibits secondary pollen presentation using brush mechanism to prevent autonomous selfing. The floral characteristics such as having synflorescence, narrow tubular corolla, production of sucrose-rich nectar with essential and non-essential amino acids and pollen charactersistics such as having spherical shape, tri-colpate apertures and strongly spinulose exine suggested that the plant is adapted for insect pollination. The plant is principally psychophilous. Other insects also visited the florets opportunistically and acted as supplementary pollinators. Further, thrips used this plant as breeding and feeding sites; their effect mostly geitonogamy. The fruit is an achene, anemochorous and also anthropochorous. Regeneration occurred from seeds and perennial root stock during rainy season.","Anemochory; Anthropochory; Brush mechanism; Lagascea mollis; Psychophily; Secondary pollen presentation",,,,,,,,"Cherian, K.J., Pollen analysis of Apis dorsata honey collected from the Wardha, Maharashtra (2010) ESSENCE, 1, pp. 77-80; Czarnecka, B., Denisow, B., Floral biology of Senecio macrophyllus M Bieb.

Detection of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1 ) up to 200 ng is considered significantly 1 1 efficient, but the production cost is considered high. The high cost was due to the cost of monoclonal antibody specific to aflatoxin and its supporting materials i.e. CNBr-activated sepharose 4B. Therefore, this study was aimed to improve the efficiency of in-house immunoaffinity colums by replacing CNBr-activated sepharose 4B with other supporting materials and to lower the ratio of antibody to supporting materials. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to determine the optimum alternative supporting materials and the ratio. Results revealed that when compared with CNBr-activated sepharose 4B, all materials tested could recover higher than 80% AFB1, except the 1 activated CH sepharose 4B. Results also indicated that the optimum ratio was 0.4 mg anti-aflatoxin monoclonal antibody to 204 μL CNBr-activated sepharose 4B. CNBr-activated sepharose 4B was considered to provide the best precision in recovering AFB1 . KU-AF02 increased the ability to detect AFB1 to 500 ppb. The recovery of AFs in the 1 1 reference materials using KU-AF02 was more than 96% successful, with HorRat value range of 0.34 - 0.76. The reference materials used were 2 levels of AFs in peanuts, i.e. 47.68 and 72.14 ng/g. In terms of quality control in IAC production, there were no significant differences among the 5 batches produced (p &gt; 0.05). KU-AF02 demonstrated o stable and constant percent recovery at 4 °C for up to 12 months (tested with standard 200 ppb AFB1 ).

An alternative method to control the disease is the application of biocontrol agents. Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) could be used as potential biocontrol agents. PGPR with siderophores is among compounds having important role in disease suppression. This experiment was conducted to select and characterize the siderophore-producing rhizobacteria from tomato and to determine their potential as antagonistic agents for R. solanacearum. Candidates of the PGPR were isolated from tomato grown in West Java Province, Indonesia. The isolates were detected as siderophore-producing bacteria using CAS medium. Among 29 isolates producing siderophore and having negative result on hypersensitivity reaction, two isolates provided the widest diameter of inhibition zone toward R. solanacearum. Both isolates were CP1C and CP2D with diameter of inhibition zone up to 3.6 and 7.0 mm, respectively. Based on the sequence of 16S rDNA, isolate CP1C was identified as Brevundimonas sp., while isolate CP2D was identified as Enterobacter sp. Both bacteria did not cause negative effect on the increasing plant height and dry weight of the plants, compared with control.","Bacterial wilt; Biocontrol; Brevundimonas; Enterobacter; PGPR",,,,,,,,"Agrios, G.N., (2005) Plant pathology, p. 992. , Fifth Edition.

Coccidiosis infection in ruminants was caused by Eimeria spp. The objective of this study was to determine Eimeria species composition and various factors influencing Eimeria oocysts shedding in dairy farm. This study was conducted with a cross-sectional study design in dairy farm in South Bandung District from July 2014 to January 2015. Samples were obtained from 400 dairy cattle (196 cattle at age < 6 months, 37 cattle at age 6 - 12 months and 167 cattle at age > 12 months). Fecal samples were collected, examined and counted for Eimeria species composition and numbers of oocysts per gram of feces (OPG) using McMaster technique. A questionnaire was completed for individual dairy cattle farmer to record information about cattle's health and husbandry. The effect of cattle's sex, age and type of pen flooring to OPG values were analyzed using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests. The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed followed by Dunn test as a multiple comparison test. Ten species of Eimeria were identified in all infected cattle. Among the Eimeria identified species, Eimeria bovis was found to have the highest prevalence (42.5%), followed subsequently by Eimeria wyomingensis (39.1%), Eimeria bukidnonensis (32.4%), Eimeria pellita (26.3%), Eimeria auburnensis (19.6%), Eimeria zuernii (17.3%), Eimeria cylindrica (3.9%), Eimeria canadensis (3.9%), Eimeria brasiliensis (3.4%) and Eimeria alabamensis (1.1%). The numbers of oocysts shed was correlated significantly (p < 0.05) with cattle's sex and age as well type of pen flooring which influenced the infection pressure. Younger calves aged less than 6 months shed the highest amount of Eimeria oocysts than older cattle. Many factors may cause the increasing number of OPG in fecal samples. Therefore, it is important to keep good sanitation and control of Eimeria among dairy cattle in the KPBS Pangalengan dairy farm.","Coccidiosis; Cross-sectional; Dairy farm; Eimeria; OPG",,,,,,,,"Abebe, R., Wossene, A., Kumsa, B., Epidemiology of Eimeria Infections in Calves in Addis Ababa and Debre Zeit Dairy Farms, Ethiopia (2008) Intern J Appl Res Vet Med, 6 (1), pp. 24-30. , http://www.jarvm.com/articles/Vol61ss1/Kumsa%252024-30.pdf, Retrieved on 12 March 2015; Alemayehu, A., Nuru, M., Belina, T., Prevalence of bovine coccidia in Kombolcha District of South Wollo, Ethiopia (2013) J Vet Med Anim Health, 5 (2), pp. 41-45. , http://www.academicjournals.org/JVMAH, Retrieved on 1 December 2014; Arslan, M.O., Tuzer, E., Prevalence of bovine Eimeridosis in Thracia, Turkey (1998) Tr J Vet Anim Sc, 22, pp. 161-164. , http:journals.tubitak.gov.tr/veterinary/issues/vet-98-22, Retrieved on 15 February 2015; Bangoura, B., Mundt, H.C., Schmaschke, R., Westphal, B., Daugschies, A., Prevalence of Eimeria bovis and Eimeria zuernii in German cattle herds and factors influencing oocyst excretion (2011) Parasitol Res, 109, pp. S129-S138. , http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arwid_Daughscies/publication/51477092_Prevalence:of_Eimeria_bovis_and_Eimeria_zuernii_in_German_cattle_herds_and_factors_influencing_oocyst_excretion/links/0fcfd512200089bd64000000.pdf, [Internet] [Retrieved on 20 March 2015]; Bruhn, F.R.P., Lopes, M.A., Demeu, F.A., Perazza, C.A., Pedrosa, M.F., Guimaraes, A.M., Frequency of species of Eimeria in females of the holstein-friesian breed at the post-weaning stage during autumn and winter (2011) Rev Bras Parasitol Vet, 20 (4), pp. 303-307. , http://www.cbpv.com.br/rbpv, Retrieved on 16 March 2015; Bruhn, F.R.P., Junior, F.A.S., Carvalho, A.H.O., Orlando, D.R., Rocha, C.M.B.M., Guimaraes, A.M., Occurences of Eimeria spp. and gastrointestinal nematodes in dairy calves in southern Minas Gerais, Brazil (2012) Rev Bras Parasitol Vet, 21 (2), pp. 171-175. , http://www.cbpv.com.br/rbpv, [Internet][Retrieved on 1 May 2015); Cahyaningsih, U., Supriyanto, Kejadian koksidiosis pada domba umur 6-12 bulan di Ciomas, Bogor In: [unknown editor].

This crop can be vegetatively propagated only using tissue culture technique. Oil palm tissue culture technique has low efficiency, with callogenesis and embryogenesis stages as the limiting factors. Genetic factor has a major role in determining the success rate of these two stages. The use of molecular markers which represent the rate of embryogenesis or callogenesis has the potential to improve the efficiency of oil palm tissue culture process. In this study, SNP mining was conducted on embryogenesis transcriptome data, oil palm cDNA database, oil palm genome database, and oil palm SNPs marker database in NCBI. The objective of this study was to obtain SNP marker which represents the embryogenesis potential, to be further used in marker assisted selection of oil palm ortets. One SNP (EMB6) showed significant association with embryogenesis rate. This SNP was found in one of Auxin Response Factor (ARF) family gene. th Nucleotide replacement from Adenine to Guanine changed the 307th amino acid from Isoleucine to Methionine. Oil palms with Adenine homozygote (A/A) pattern on the EMB6 showed 8-fold higher chance to produce significantly higher embryogenesis rate than Adenine-Guanine heterozygote (A/G).","Glandular trichome; Hyptis capitata.; Idioblast; Medicinal plants; Phyto-compounds",,,,,,,,"Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) J Mol Biol, 215, pp. 403-410; Cochard, B., Durand-Gasselin, T., Amblard, P., Konan, E.K., Gogor, S., Performance of adult oil palm clones (1999) agriculture conference Proceedings of 1999 PORIM International Palm Oil Congress, pp. 53-64. , Ariffin D, Chan KW.

Mistletoe infestations in teak and mistletoe species name have been reported, but there are still problems in identifying the correct species or subspecies due to morphological similarity. The objective of this study was to clarify the species identity of hemiparasitic mistletoe plants, which were found in teak Clonal Seed Orchard (CSO) in Padangan, East Java Province, Indonesia using DNA barcodes. Species identification of teak mistletoe based on leaf morphological characteristics and universal DNA barcode regions (i.e. matK and rbcL) were carried out. The results showed that the Canonical Discriminant Analysis (CDA) could differentiate Dendrophthoe pentandra and Macrosolen tetragonus based on leaf morphological characteristics. Variables having high correlation to distinguish both species were length of petiole, width of the widest leaf, number of secondary leaf veins, leaf base shape, aspect ratio, form factor and perimeter ratio of diameter. The results of DNA barcoding showed that the two DNA barcode regions presented good amplification and sequence results. Both DNA barcode regions successfully differentiated two species i.e. D. pentandra and M. tetragonus which belong to Loranthaceae family and have similar leaf morphological characteristics. Those regions were also able to identify Viscum articulatum and other species belonging to Santalaceae family. These results suggested that the two DNA regions could become recommended universal DNA barcode for identifying teak mistletoe.","Clonal Seed Orchard; DNA barcode; MatK; RbcL; Teak mistletoe",,,,,,,,"Anwar, A., (2015) Variasi morfologi daun dan sekuens ITS2 pada jelutung darat (Dyera costulata (Miq.)Hook.f) dan jelutung rawa (Dyera polyphylla (Miq.)

The dense cover happened in all areas of Mount Merapi National Park (MMNP) in Java, Indonesia. This study was aimed to describe the relationship between major natural disturbance from volcanic eruption in triggering the invasion of A. Decurrens in Mount Merapi National Park. Vegetation data were collected using line transect in two different sites. The first site was Cangkringan which was affected by pyroclastic flow and the second site was Selo which was not affected by pyroclastic flow. Distribution patterns and association of A. Decurrens with other species in each location was analyzed using ordination analysis of the Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS). Microclimate such as temperature, humidity, light density and soil humidity was recorded in each location. Correlation between species abundance and microclimate data was assessed using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). The results showed that the population of A. Decurrens was more dominant in Cangkringan than in Selo site. Cangkringan site was impacted with pyroclastic flow during Mount Merapi eruption in 2010, while Selo site was not affected. In Cangkringan, A. Decurrens was distributed in clump, while in Selo the plant was randomly distributed. Ordination analysis using NMDS showed that there was positive association between A decurrens and herbaceous plant. Negative association was observed between A. Decurrens and other tree species. CCA analysis showed that temperature and light density was positively correlated with A. Decurrens abundance. This study showed that the IAPS invasion in MMNP was correlated with the eruption of Mount Merapi.","Acacia decurrens; Autecology; Eruption; Invasive",,,,,,,,"Alpert, P., Bone, E., Holzapfel, C., Invasiveness, invisibility and the role of environmental stress in the spread of non-native plants (2000) Perspect Plant Ecol Evol Syst, 3 (1), pp. 52-66; Impact of Mount Merapi Eruption (2011) Gema BNPB, 2 (1), pp. 17-20; Brooks, M.L., D'Antonio, C.M., Richadson, D.M., Grace, J.B., Keeley, J.E., DiTomasso, J.M., Hobss, R.J., Pyke, D., Effect of invasive alien plant on fire gerimes (2004) Bioscience, 54, pp. 677-688; Call, L.J., Nilsen, E.T., Analysis of spatial patterns and spatial association between the invasive Tree-of- Heaven (Ailanthus altissima) and the native Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) (2003) Am Midl Nat, 150, pp. 1-4; Clarke, K.R., Gorley, R.N., (2001) PRIMER: Plymouth Routines in Multivariate Ecological Research, p. 129. , Plymouth (UK): PRIMER-E Ltd; (2014) Invasive Alien Species, , http://www.cbd.int/html, Retrieved on 12 Februari 2014; Coutts-Smith, A.J., Downey, P.O., (2006) Impact of weeds on threatened biodiversity in New South Wales, , Adelaide (AU).

Allium cepa root tip assay is a preliminary study to assess the cytotoxic effect of plant extracts. The cytotoxic activity of plants can be correlated to their anticancer potential. Cytotoxic potential of Pogostemon heyneanus (Lamiaceae) was evaluated using A. Cepa root meristematic cells. This study was aimed at analyzing cytotoxic potential of P heyneanus using Allium cepa root tip assay. Four different concentrations of the aqueous leaf extracts at three different durations were examined. Distilled water was used as control. The extract was found to be cytotoxic at all tested concentrations, when compared to control. Mitotic index was found to be decreasing with the increase in extract concentrations and treatment durations. The aqueous extract of P. Heyneanus was found to be an effective cytotoxic agent, inducing various clastogenic and non- clastogenic aberrations such as chromosome gaps, bridges, multipolar anaphase, fragments, nuclear budding and lesions, hyperchromasia, laggards and mitotic pairing.","Allium cepa assay; Anti-mitotic; Chromosomal aberrations; Cytotoxicity; Pogostemon heyneanus",,,,,,,,"Akaneme, F.I., Iyioke, I.V., Mutagenic potentials of the sterilizing fluid - Purital on root tip mitosis of Allium cepa (2008) Bio Res, 6, pp. 293-297; Akinboro, A., Bakare, A.A., Cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of aqueous extracts of five medicinal plants on Allium cepa Linn (2007) J Ethnopharmacol, 112, pp. 470-475; Anjana, S., Thoppil, J.E., Chemical composition of the essential oils of four Pogostemon spp. and their larvicidal activity against Aedes albopictus Skuse (Diptera: Culicidae) (2013) Int J Environ Biol, 3, pp. 26-31; Asita, A.O., Mokhobo, M.M., Clastogenic and cytotoxic effects of four pesticides used to control insect pests of stored products on root meristems of Allium cepa (2013) Environ Nat Resour Res, 3, pp. 133-145; Auti, S., Pagare, R., Ahire, D., Sawale, V., Cytogenetical studies on the effect of omnacortil on root tip cells of Allium cepaL (2010) J Cell Tissue Res, 10, pp. 2331-2335; Çelik, T.A., Äslanturk, O.S., Anti-mitotic and anti- genotoxic effects of Plantago lanceolata aqueous extract on Allium cepa root tip meristem cells (2006) Biologia, 61, pp. 693-697; Çelik, T.A., Àslanturk, O.S., Cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of Lavandula stoechas aqueous extracts (2007) Biologia, 62, pp. 292-296; Christopher, H.B., Kapoor, M.B., The cytogenetic effects of sodium salicylate on the root meristem cells of Allium sativa L (1988) Cytologia, 54, pp. 203-209; El-Ghamery, A.A., El-Kholy, M.A., Abou El-Yousser, M.A., Evaluation of cytological effects of Zn2+ in relation to germination and root growth of Nigella sativa L. and Triticum aestivum L (2003) Mutat Res, 537, pp. 29-41; Fiskesjo, G., The Allium test-an alternative in environmental studies: The relative toxicity of metal ions (1988) Mutat Res, 197, pp. 243-260; Fiskesjo, G., Allium test for screening chemicals evaluation of cytological parameters (1997) Plants for Environmental Studies, pp. 307-333. , In: Wang W, Gorsuch JW, Huges JS, editors.

It is also used as an icon of tropical region. Coconut fruit is very heavy and can cause injuries if the fruit falls down and hits somebody who happens to be underneath a coconut tree. In order to avoid the accident, the coconut fruits have to be regularly cut off. Coconut tree originated from in vitro cultured endosperm is a triploid plant that produces seedless fruit (without endocarp). Coconut fruit without endocarp is not heavy. The objective of this study was to investigate plant regeneration of fresh and in vitro cultured coconut endosperms. The fresh and developed in vitro cultured coconut endosperms were observed using histological analysis. Solid endosperm of seven month-old postanthesis coconut from ""Samoan Dwarf"" cultivar was freshly picked up and cultured in vitro on modified Branton & Blake formula. Histological study of fresh coconut endosperm showed that the endosperm consisted of parenchyma cells, which were relatively uniform in shape and size, with some nuclei consisted of 1-5 nucleoli. Three month-old calli of in vitro grown coconut endosperm in semi solid media showed that its cells varied in shape and size, characterized by high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, high starch, protein and lipid contents which underwent many divisions. Seven month-old calli of in vitro grown coconut endosperm in liquid media showed embryogenic cells which resembled proembryos. Fourteen month-old bud-like structure of coconut endosperm in semi solid media showed a meristematic layer, tunica-corpus structure, cortex-like region and tracheids of xylem. These results indicated that the bud-like structure was an early stage of shoot bud formation in coconut endosperm. This is the first report of early stage of shoot bud formation occurring on coconut endosperm cultured in vitro.","Bud-like structure; Calli; Coconut endosperm; Cultured in vitro; Histological analysis",,,,,,,,"Ake, A.P.Y., Maust, B., Orozco-Segovia Oropeza, C., The effect of gibberellic acid on the in vitro germination of coconut zygotic embryos and their conversion into plantlets (2007) In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Plant, 43, pp. 247-253; Anzidei, M., Vivona, L., Schiff, S., Bennici, A., In vitro culture of Foeniculum vulgare: Callus characteristics in relation to morphogenesis (1996) Plant Cell Tissue Organ Cult, 45, pp. 263-268; Arnold, S.V., Hakman, I., Regulation of somatic embryo development in Picea abies by abscisic acid (ABA) (1988) J Plant Physiol, 132, pp. 164-169; Berlyn, G.P., Miksche, J.P., (1976) Botanical microtechnique and cytochemistry, p. 326. , Ames (US): The Iowa State University Press; Bhalla-Sarin, N., Bagga, S., (1983) In vitro culture of embryos and other parts of Cocos nucifera L.

The objective of this study is to isolate molybdenum-reducing bacterium with the ability to grow on phenolic compounds (phenol and catechol). The screening process was carried out on a microplate. The bacterium reduced molybdenum in the form of sodium molybdate to molybdenum blue (Mo-blue). The bacterium required a narrow pH range for optimal reduction of molybdenum, i.e. Between pH 6.3 and 6.8, with temperature between 34 and 37 o C. Molybdate reduction to Mo-blue was best supported by glucose as the carbon source. However, both phenol and catechol could not support molybdate reduction. Other requirements for molybdate reduction included sodium molybdate concentrations between 15 and 30 mM, and phosphate concentration of 5.0 mM. The bacterium exhibited a Mo-blue absorption spectrum with a shoulder at 700 nm and a maximum peak near the infrared region at 865 nm. The Mo-reducing bacterium was partially identified as Enterobacter sp. Strain Saw-2. The capability of this bacterium to grow on toxic phenolic compounds and to detoxify molybdenum made it a significant agent for bioremediation.","Catechol; Enterobacter sp.; Molybdenum; Molybdenum blue; Phenol",,,,,,,,"Abo-Shakeer, L.K.A., Ahmad, S.A., Shukor, M.Y., Shamaan, N.A., Syed, M.A., Isolation and characterization of a molybdenum-reducing Bacillus pumilus strain lbna (2013) J Environ Microbiol Toxicol, 1, pp. 9-14; Ahmad, S.A., Shukor, M.Y., Shamaan, N.A., MaCormack, W.P., Syed, M.A., Molybdate reduction to molybdenum blue by an Antarctic bacterium (2013) Bio Med Res Int, p. 2013. , Article number 871941; Ahmad, S.A., Syed, M.A., Arif, N.M., Shukor, M.Y.A., Shamaan, N.A., Isolation, identification and characterization of elevated phenol degrading Acinetobacter sp. strain AQ5NOL1 (2011) Aust J Basic Appl Sci, 5, pp. 1035-1045; Aravindhan, R., Naveen, N., Anand, G., Rao, J.R., Nair, B.U., Kinetics of biodegradation of phenol and a polyphenolic compound by a mixed culture containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis (2014) Appl Ecol Environ Res, 12, pp. 615-625; Arif, N.M., Ahmad, S.A., Syed, M.A., Shukor, M.Y., Isolation and characterization of a phenol-degrading Rhodococcus sp. strain AQ5NOL 2 KCTC 11961BP (2013) J Basic Microbiol, 53, pp. 9-19; Arutchelvan, V., Kanakasabai, V., Elangovan, R., Nagarajan, S., Muralikrishnan, V., Kinetics of high strength phenol degradation using Bacillus brevis (2006) J Hazard Mater, 129, pp. 216-222; Auffret, M.D., Yergeau, E., Labbé, D., Fayolle-Guichard, F., Greer, C.W., Importance of Rhodococcus strains in a bacterial consortium degrading a mixture of hydrocarbons, gasoline, and diesel oil additives revealed by metatranscriptomic analysis (2015) Appl Microbiol Biotechnol, 99, pp. 2419-2430; Bai, J., Wen, J.P., Li, H.M., Jiang, Y., Kinetic modeling of growth and biodegradation of phenol and m-cresol using Alcaligenesfaecalis (2007) Process Biochem, 42, pp. 510-517; Banerjee, G., Pandey, S., Ray, A.K., Kumar, R., Bioremediation of heavy metals by a novel bacterial strain Enterobacter cloacae and its antioxidant enzymes activity, flocculants production and protein expression in presence of these heavy metals (2015) Water Air Soil Poll, 226, pp. 91-99; Banerjee, G., Pandey, S., Ray, A.K., Kumar, R., An alternative approach of water treatment by Arthrobacter phenanthrenivorans.

Indiscriminate landscape changes in the rural areas and tendencies towards crop monocultures can have significant effects on pollinator habitats and effectiveness. This study was aimed at observing insect pollinators, their visitation frequencies and timings on monsoon cucurbit crops such as Cucumis sativus L., C. Pubescens Willd., Momordica charantia L., Trichonsanthes anguina L. And Luffa acutangula L. (Roxb.), in a coastal Karnataka Village. This study was also aimed at covering the significance of the surrounding landscape elements in sustaining pollinator elements. Bees, such as Apis dorsata, A. Cerana and Trigrrna sp., were maj or visitors on all cucurbits, except snake gourd which was pollinated mainly by lepidopterans. Insect species were found to partition floral resources of any given crops between them by minimal overlapping in their visitation timings. Natural elements of the landscape around, mainly a village forest and rocky savanna furnished habitats for bees and lepidopterans. Prolifically blooming monsoon herbs on lateritic plateaus, by providing nectar resources for pollinators, presumably play key role in making the case study village well known for monsoon vegetables.","Agroecosystem; Crop pollination; Cucurbits; Foraging behavior; Landscape; Laterite",,,,,,,,"Abrol, D.P., (2012) Pollination biology: Biodiversity conservation and agricultural production, p. 792. , New York (US): Springer Dordrecht Heidelberg; Balachandran, C., Chandran, M.D.S., Ramachandra, T.V., Keystone food resources for honeybees in South India west coast during monsoon (2014) Curr Sci, 106 (10), pp. 1379-1386; Belavadi, V.V., Ganeshaiah, K.N., (2013) Insect pollination manual, p. 44. , Bangalore (IN): University of Agriculture Sciences; Chandran, M.D.S., Halkar Village, Uttara Kannada (2001) Community conserved area in India-an overview, pp. 316-321. , Neema P, editor.

The experiment was conducted using randomized complete block design with 12 provenances, 105 families and 5 replications of 4-tree row plots. Total height and root collar diameter were measured at the age of 18 months growth. Significant differences among the provenances and families within provenances were observed for height and collar diameter at all sites, except for the collar diameter of among provenances at Parungpanjang site. In general, Garut (GSJ) provenance performed better growth at the two sites than Kualakencana (KKP) and Nusa Kambangan (NKJ) provenances. The evaluation of component of variance at the two sites showed that the provenance effects (ranging from 0.5 to 1.7%) contributed more to total variance than family within provenance effects(ranging from 0.4 to 0.6%). Genetic correlations between height and collar diameter were weak to moderate. Heritability was low for all traits at Limbangan, while at Parungpanjang, the heritability was moderate. Estimation of genetic gain for height and diameter by proportional selected family 0.30 was 0.13 and 0.18 for Limbangan and 0.31 and 0.16 for Parungpanjang. Heritability measurement should be sustained to reach stable value. Stable heritability combined with selection of family and selection within family will improve genetic gain.","Genetic correlation; Genetic parameter; Heritability; Neolamarckia cadamba; Progeny; Provenance; Selection",,,,,,,,"Acharyya, S., Rathore, D.S., Kumar, H.K.S., Panda, N., Screening of Anthocephalus cadamba (Roxb.)

The abiotic factors influencing M. peltata invasion were investigated in this study. This research compared abiotic factors in three forest locations with different invasion levels i.e.severe, moderate and mild invasions. Abiotic factors measured were percentage of tree canopy coverage, micro climate factors (temperature and humidity), elevation above sea level and physical and chemical properties of the soil surface. In this study, canopy coverage is classified as abiotic factors because it influencesthe intensity of light that can reach the forestfloor. Aposthoc Duncan's Multiple Range Test (DMRT) was employed to determine significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) among abiotic factors. In addition, a test of correlation and multiple linear regression were conducted to determine the relationships between abiotic factors and M. peltata invasion. Multiple regression testing showed that canopy coverage significantly (p &lt; 0.05) influenced M. peltata invasion. Based on the generated model, a 1% addition of canopy coverage would decrease M. peltata invasion by 2.8%. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to predict the relationship between soil nutrients and invasion. The C/N ratio and P2O5, Ca, Mg and Na concentration significantly (p &lt; 0.05) influenced invasion level. Again, based on the generated model, the increase in the C/N ratio aswell as in P2O5 and Ca concentrations were correlated with the reduction of M. peltata invasion; while the increase of Mg and Na concentrations were correlated with the increase of M. peltata invasion. M. peltata invasion in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park was influenced by opened forest canopy andwas correlated with high concentration of Na and Mg in the soil of the invaded forest areas.","Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park; Invasive species; Mantangan; Merremia peltata",,,,,,,,"Agustina, L., (2004) Dasar-dasar Nutrisi Tanaman, , Jakarta (ID):PTRineka Cipta; Crozier, C.R., Heiniger, R.W., (1998) Soil Facts: Soil Sampling for Precision Farming Systems, , North Carolina (USA): NorthCarolina StateUniversity; Fosberg, F.R., Sachet, M.H., Flora of Micronesia, part 3, Convolvulaceae (1977) ContributiiBotanice, 36, pp. 1-34; Gaveaua, D.L.A., Wandono, H., Setiabudi, F., Three decades of deforestation in southwest Sumatera: Have protected areas halted forest loss and logging, and promoted re-growth (2007) Biol Conserv, 134, pp. 495-504; Hamim, (2008) Jakarta Fisiologi Tumbuhan, , (ID): Universitas Terbuka; Hanafiah, K.A., (2007) Dasar-dasar Ilmu Tanah, , Jakarta (ID): PT.

Their existence is threatened by various factors i.e. land conversion, pollution and interisland bridge existence. Growth of A. marina is currently limited by seed dormancy. In an effort to increase propagation efficiency, seed viability and vigor were compared based on collection dates and pericarp removal methods. The results showed no relationship between salinity levels of soaking water or seed buoyancy and seed viability or seed vigor. Collection dates may influence seed viability and vigor. Seeds collected in October and November germinated more quickly than those collected in December, although there were no differences in total germination. Hand-peeled seeds germinated more slowly than soaked seeds for all collections, but with no differences in total germination. Seeds collected in October and November grew more vigorously than those collected in December.","Avicennia marina; Propagation eficiency; Seed viability",,,,,,,,"Arrillaga, I., Marzo, T., Segura, J., Embryo culture of Fraxinus ornus and Sorbus domestica removes seed dormancy (1992) Hort Science, 27, p. 371; Alleman, L.K., Hester, M.W., Refinement of the fundamental niche of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) seedling in Louisiana: applications for restoration (2010) Wetl Ecol Manag, 19, pp. 47-60; Baskin, C.C., Baskin, J.M., (1998) Seeds: ecology, biogeography, and evolution of dormancy and germination, p. 666. , San Diego, CA (US): Academic Press; Basra, A.S., (1995) Seed quality: the basic mechanisms and agricultural implications, p. 376. , Binghamton, NY (US): Haworth Press; Chačon, P., Bustamante, R.O., Effect of seed size and pericarp on seedling recruitment and biomass in Cryptocarya alba (Lauraceae) under two contrasting moisture regimes (2001) Plant Ecol, 152, pp. 137-144; Crumbie, M.C., Avicennia marina: the grey mangrove: general notes and observations (1987) Bull Emirates Nat Hist Gr (Abu Dhabi), 32, pp. 2-13; Demir, I., Ellis, R.H., Changes in seed quality during seed development and maturation in tomato (1992) Seed Sci Res, 2, pp. 81-87; Farnsworth, E., The ecology and physiology of viviparous and recalcitrant seeds (2000) Ann Revue Ecol Systematics, 31, pp. 107-138; Finney, W., (2011) Comparative growth and propagule viability of Louisiana-harvested black mangrove, Avicennia germinans, p. 34. , Master Thesis.

Bukit Duabelas National Park is one of the few remaining lowland forests in Jambi Province (Sumatera, Indonesia). The surrounding areas up to the national park borders have already been converted into jungle rubber agroforests as well as rubber and oil palm plantations which might lead to an increased spread of IPS into the forest. This study was aimed at compiling a list of IPS and determining their distribution and coverage of IPS in four land use systems (rain forest jungle rubber, rubber and oil palm plantations). Spatial distribution patterns were investigated by creating a horizontal vegetation profile diagram for the permanent plots of the EFForTS project (Ecological and Socioeconomic Functions of Tropical Lowland Rainforest Transformation Systems, http://www.uni-goettingen.de/crc990). The dominance of IPS was determined using Important Value Index. A total of forty IPS were identified across the four land-use systems. The numbers of IPS were the highest in oil palm (28 species) and rubber plantations (27 species), and the lowest in jungle rubber (10 species). IPS were absent in the lowland rain forest. The diversity of IPS was influenced by environmental factors, especially canopy openness. IPS with the highest ground coverage were Dicranopteris linearis and Clidemia hirta. Both of them were found in all three land-use systems outside the rain forest when the forest canopy opens due to illegal logging or other human disturbances. Therefore, reforestation of disturbed areas is recommended to prevent the spread of IPS.","Bukit Duabelas National Park; Clidemia hirta; Dicranopteris linearis; Invasive Plant Species (IPS)",,,,,,,,"Beckschäfer, P., Seidel, D., Kleinn, C., Xu, J., On the exposure of hemipherical photographs in forests (2013) iForest-Biogeosciences and Forestry, 6, pp. 228-237; Booth, B.D., Murphy, S.D., Swanton, C.J., (2010) Invasive plant nd ecology in natural and agricultural systems, , 2 Ed.

Forest fire often leads to alteration of forest structure and its functions. This study of tree growth after forest fire was conducted using a model simulation. The model was performed at the individual level of plant community and built to analyze the potential of tree growth and its scenario for post-fire recovery. Five important tree species from montane forest of Mount Ciremai were chosen to build the model based on four main parameters i.e. plant growth rate, diameter at breast height (DBH), tree-to-grass competition and tree-to-tree competition. The scenario of postfire recovery was performed by replanting similar species with 5 cm DBH seedling. Prediction from our model showed that most of the chosen species would recover to its pre-fire condition after 37 - 50 years. Considering the limitation of competition after re-planting, it was suggested to minimize tree to tree competition and applied silvicultural treatments to maximize tree growth and tree community recovery.","Forest fire; Mount Ciremai National Park; Tree growth model; Tropical montane forest",,,,,,,,"Basuki, T.M., van Laake, P.E., Skidmore, A.K., Hussin, Y.A., Allometric equations for estimating the aboveground biomass in tropical lowland Dipterocarp forests (2009) For Ecol Manage, 257, pp. 1684-1694; Botkin, D.B., Janak, J.F., Walis, J.R., Some ecological consequences of a computer model of forest growth (1972) J Ecol, 60 (3), pp. 649-872; Cochrane, M.A., Fire science for rainforests (2003) Nature, 421, pp. 913-919; Flannigan, M.D., Stocks, B.J., Wotton, B.M., Climate change and forest fires (2000) Sci Total Environ, 262, pp. 221-229; Gonzales-Ochoa, A., de las Heras, J., Effects of post-fire silviculture practices on Pachyrhinus squamosus defoliation levels and growth of Pinus halepenses Mill (2002) For Ecol Manage, 167, pp. 185-194; Gonzales-Ochoa, A., Lopez-Serrano, F.R., de las Heras, J., Does post-fire forest management increase tree growth and cone production in Pinus halepensis?

Salinity affects rice growth and the activities of soil functional microbes, including functional bacteria, which play roles in plant growth. Some of these microbes are associated with rice plants and are able to survive under saline condition. The presence of functional microbes is also important to improve soil quality. Nitrogen and phosphate are essential soil nutrients and is available in soil due to the activities of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and free-living plant-associated bacteria. The objective of the present study was to obtain nitrogen-fixing, phosphate solubilizing and Indole Acetic Acid (IAA)-producing bacteria that are able to survive and promote the growth of rice under saline conditions. From rice and peanut rhizosphere, Caphosphate (Ca-P) solubilizing and nitrogen-fixing bacteria were isolated separately using specific media. Then, the Ca- P solubilizing ability, phosphomonoesterase activity and IAA-producing ability were quantitatively examined. Based on the abilities, 20 strains were selected and identified as Burkholderia cepacia-complex, Burkholderia anthina, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Bacillus cereus-complex (three strains), Achromobacter spanius, Azospirillum sp. (four strains), Azotobacter sp. (three strains), Rhizobium leguminosarum, Rhizobium sp. (two strains), and Pseudomonas sp. (three strains). The inoculation of several single strains or the mixture of the selected strains promoted the growth of rice under saline conditions. These inoculants could be potential as biofertilizer in saline paddy fields.","Indole Acetic Acid production; Nitrogen fixation; Phosphate solubilization; Plant growth promoting bacteria; Rhizosphere; Rice",,,,,,,,"Aquilanti, L.F.F., Clementi, F., Comparison of different strategies for isolation and preliminary identification of Azotobacter from soil samples (2004) Soil Biol Biochem, 36 (9), pp. 1475-1483; Ashraf, M., Harris, P.J.C., Potential biochemical indicators of salinity tolerance in plants (2004) Plant Sci, 166 (1), pp. 3-16; Balser, T.C., McMahon, K.D., Bart, D., Bronson, D., Coyle, D.R., Craig, N., Flores-Mangual, M.L., Shade, A.L., Bridging the gap between micro and macro-scale perspectives on the role of microbial communities in global change ecology (2006) Plant Soil, 289, pp. 59-70; Banig, A.E., Aly, E.A., Khaled, A.A., Amel, K.A., Isolation, characterization and application of bacterial population from agricultural soil at Sohag Province, Egypt (2008) Malays J Microbiol, 4 (2), pp. 42-50; Bhattacharjee, R., Dey, U., Biofertilizer a way towards organic agriculture a review (2014) Afr J Microbiol Res, 8 (24), pp. 2332-2342; Bhattacharyya, P.N., Jha, D.K., Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR): Emergence in agriculture (2012) World J Microbiol Biotechnol, 28, pp. 1327-1350; Cerabolini, B., Andreis, D.R., Ceriani, R.M., Pierce, S., Raimondi, B., Seed germination and conservation of enandgered species from the Italian Alps: Physoplexis comosa and Primula glaucescens (2004) Biol Conserv, 117 (3), pp. 351-356; Chen, Y.P., Rekha, P.D., Arun, A.B., Shen, F.T., Lai, W.A., Young, C.C., Phosphate solubilizing bacteria from subtropical soil and their tricalcium phosphate solubilizing abilities (2006) Appl Soil Ecol, 34 (1), pp. 33-41; Chien, C.T., Maundu, J., Cavaness, J., Dandurand, L.M., Orser, C.S., Characterization of salt-tolerant and saltsensitive mutants of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovarviciae strain C1204b (1992) FEMS Microbiol Lett, 169 (2), pp. 135-140; Crozier, A., Arruda, P., Monteiro, A.M., Sandberg, G., Analysis of indole-3-acetic acid and related indoles in culture medium from Azospirillum lipoferum and Azospirillum brasilense (1988) Appl Environ Microbiol, 54 (11), pp. 2833-2837; Djufry, F., Sudarsono, A., Lestari, M.S., Tingkat toleransi beberapa galur harapan padi pada kondisi salinitas di lahan rawa pasang surut (2011) J Agrivigor, 10 (2), pp. 196-207; Gravel, V., Antoun, H., Tweddell, R.J., Growth stimulation and fruit yield improvement of greenhouse tomato plants by inoculation with Pseudomonas putida or Trichoderma atroviride: Possible role of indole acetic acid (IAA) (2007) Soil Biol Biochem, 39, pp. 1968-1977; Hasan, H.A.H., Gibberellin and auxin-indole production by plant root-fungi and their biosynthesis under salinity-calcium interaction (2002) Acta Microbiol Immunol Hung, 49 (1), pp. 105-118; Lugtenberg, B., Malfanova, N., Kamilova, F., Berg, G., Plant growth promotion by microbes (2013) Molecular microbial ecology of the rhizosphere, pp. 561-573. , In:Bruijn FJ de (editor).

The river runs through forestry, housing and farming areas. This condition leads to a prediction that the river has been altered on its physico-chemical characteristics causing the river to be inhabited by a variety of fish species. This study aimed to collect data about fish species inhabiting Cijalu River and its distribution. A survey method has been done with clustered random sampling technique. The river was divided into three different areas, i.e. upper-, middle- and downstreams. Species diversity was measured as the number of species, while distribution was measured as the presentation of fish species in each site. Nineteen fish species of 10 families were identified from Cijalu River. The 10 families were Anabantidae, Bagridae, Balitoridae, Channidae, Cichlidae, Cyprinidae, Loricariidae, Osphronemidae, Poecilidae and Sisoridae. Cyprinidae was the family having the highest number of species (6 species), followed by Bagridae (3 species), Channidae (2 species) and Osphronemidae (2 species). The remaining respective families were represented by one species. A complex pattern of fish distribution was observed during the study. Glyptothorax platypogon and Channa gacua were only found at the upper-streams, while Anabas testudineus was obtained in downstreams. The other remaining species could be observed either from the middle- to downstreams, or even from upper- to downstreams. Different pattern of species distribution could be caused by physico-chemical characteristics variation from upper to lower parts of the river, especially water velocity and substrate types.","Cijalu River; Distribution; Diversity; Fish",,,,,,,,"Ahmad, A.B., Fahmi-Ahmad, M., Rizal, S.Y., Fish diversity in sm ll streams of Sungkai Wildlife a Reserve, Perak, Malaysia (2014) JWildlife and Park, 29, pp. 13-21; Albaret, J.J., Simier, M., Darboe, F.S., Jean-Marc, E., Raffray, J., de Morais, L.T., Fish diversity and distribution in the Gambia Estuary, West Africa, in relation to environmental variables (2004) Aquat Living Resour, 17 (1), pp. 35-46; Albins, M.A., Hixon, M.A., Invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish Pterois molitans reduce recruitment of Atlantic coralreef fishes (2008) MarEcol Prog Series, 367, pp. 233-238; (1985) Standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater, , 16 edition th.Washington.USA; Brown, V.M., Fishes (1975) In:Studies in Ecology: Rivers Ecology, , Edited by Whitton BA.

A greenhouse experiment was carried out to test the effect of different substrate moisture levels and competition between native fig (Ficus fistulosa) and invasive grass Pennisetum polystachyon on the native fig's growth and survival. Ficus fistulosawas chosen as the studied species because it has high Importance Value Index (IVI) compared to other fig species tested in Ciampea limestone hill. The results showed that the substrate moisture levels did not affect the native fig biomass and the invasive grass biomass was not reduced by drought. The interaction of substratemoisture levels and competition frominvasive grass reduced overall fig biomass, but not the leaf numbers and individual plant size. This study suggested that for quarry rehabilitation, invasive species management should be advocated alongwith soil treatment. © 2015 Seameo Biotrop.","Ficus fistulosa competition; Quarried limestone; Rehabilitation; Substrate moisture",,,,,,,,"Ballesteros, M., Cafladas, E.M., Foronda, A., Fernandez-Ondoflo, E., Peflas, J., Lorite, J., Vegetation recovery of gypsum quarries: short-term sowing response to different soil treatments (2012) App Veg Sci, 15, pp. 187-197; Clayton, W.D., Vorontsova, M.S., Harman, K.T., Williamson, H., Onwards (2006) GrassBase-The Online World Grass Flora, , http://www.kew.org/data/grasses-db.html, [Internet].

Two transect lines of 460 and 260 m in length with small quadrats of 1 m2 were placed at the open and protected beaches 2 perpendicularly to the coastlines. The importance value index and similarity index (SI) of organisms on these taxa were calculated along each transect. Echinometra mathaei was the most dominant echinoid at open and protected beaches, while Protoreaster nodusus was the most dominant asteroid in both areas. Most SI values of Echinoidea at the open beach were estimated to be less than 50%, which was lower than SI values of organisms at the protected beach. On the other hand, most of SI values of Asteroidea at both areas were estimated more than 70% reflecting high degree of similarity of its species composition among sites. The dissimilarity index of organisms in the taxa of Echinoidea and Asteroidea increased significantly with increasing distance between sites, which suggested that the pattern in beta diversity of these taxa was associated with spatial heterogeneity.","Asteroidea; Beta diversity; Echinoidea; Similarity index; Wakatobi marine national park","Echinoida; Echinoidea; Echinometra mathaei",,,,,,,"Adjeroud, M., Factors influencing spatial patterns on coral reefs around Moorea, French Polynesia (1997) Mar Ecol Progr Ser, 159, pp. 105-119; Beaman, R.J., Daniell, J.J., Harris, P.T., Geology-benthos relationships on a temperate rocky bank, eastern Bass Strait, Australia (2005) Mar Fresh Res, 56 (7), pp. 943-958; Barros, F., Underwood, A.J., Archambault, P., The influence of troughs and crests of ripple marks on the structure of subtidal benthic assemblages around rocky reefs (2004) Estuar Coast Shelf Sci, 60 (4), pp. 781-790; Barrett, N., Sanderson, J.C., Lawler, M., Halley, V., Jordan, A., Mapping of inshore marine habitats in south eastern Tasmania for marine protected area planning and marine management (2001) Technical Report, , Hobart: Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute; Borcard, D., Legendre, P., Drapeau, P., Partialling out the spatial component of ecological variation (1992) Ecology, 73, pp. 1045-1055; Bray, J.R., Curtis, J.T., An ordination of the upland forest communities of Southern Wisconsin (1957) Ecol Monog, 27, pp. 325-349; Brower, J.E., Jerrold, H.Z., Carl, N.V.E., (1997) Field and Laboratory Methods for General Ecology, , New York (US): McGraw-Hill Higher Education; Cleary, D.F.R., An examination of scale of assessment, logging and ENSO-induced fires on butterfly diversity in Borneo (2003) Oecologia, 135, pp. 313-321; Cleary, D.F.R., Mooers, AØ, Eichhorn, K.A.O., Menken, S.B.J., Diversity and community composition of butterflies and odonates in an ENSO-induced fire affected habitat mosaic: a case study from East Kalimantan, Indonesia (2004) Oikos, 105, pp. 426-446; Ellingsen, K.E., Gray, J.S., Spatial patterns of benthic diversity: is there a latitudinal gradient along the Norwegian continental shelf (2002) J Anim Ecol, 71, pp. 373-389; Gatson, K.J., Global patterns in biodiversity (2000) Nature, 405, pp. 220-228; Fortin, M.J., Keitt, T.H., Maurer, B.A., Taper, M.L., Kaufman, D.M., Blackburn, T.M., Species' geographic ranges and distributional limits: pattern analysis and statistical issues (2005) Oikos, 108 (1), pp. 7-17; Gray, J.S., The measurement of marine species diversity, with an application to the benthic fauna of the Norwegian continental shelf (2000) J Exp Mar Bio Ecol, 250, pp. 23-49; Halpern, B.S., Walbridge, S., Selkoe, K.A., Kappel, C.V., Micheli, F., D'Argosa, C., Bruno, J.F., Watson, R., A global map of human impact on marine ecosystems (2008) Science, 319, pp. 948-952; Harrison, S., Ross, S.J., Lawton, J.H., Beta diversity on geographic gradients in Britain (1992) J Anim Ecol, 61, pp. 151-158; Hunt, B., Vincent, A.C.J., Scale and sustainability of marine bioprospecting for pharmaceuticals (2006) Ambio, 35 (2), pp. 57-64; Jackson, J.B.C., Ecological extinction and evolution in the brave new ocean (2008) Proc Nat Acad Sci, 105, pp. 11458-11465; Jie, H., Zhinan, Z., Zishan, Y., Widdows, J., Differences in the benthic-pelagic particle flux (biodeposition and sediment erosion) at intertidal sites with and without clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) cultivation in eastern China (2001) J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 261 (2), pp. 245-261; Kendall, M., Jensen, O., Alexander, C., Field, D., McFall, G., Bohne, R., Monaco, M., Benthic mapping using sonar, video transects and an innovative approach to accuracy assessment: a characterization of bottom features in the Georgia Bights (2005) J Coast Res, 21, pp. 1154-1165; Knight, T.W., Morris, D.W., How many habitats do landscapes contain?

This study found that Merremia peltata, an invasive climbing/creeping species, has dominated some area of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (BBSNP). Domination of this species was favoured by forest fragmentation, indicated by the significantly higher number of individuals of M. peltata in the open area than in intact forest. The ecophysiological characters of M. peltata support the ability of this species to become a strong invader. As the expansion of this species may negatively affect the biodiversity and vegetation health, the application of appropriate ecological approaches to control the domination of M. peltata in the conservation area is necessary.","Ecophysiology; Forest fragmentation; Merremia peltata; Population size","Merremia peltata",,,,,,,"Brokaw, N., Busing, R.T., Niche versus chance and tree diversity in forest gaps (2000) Tree, 15, pp. 183-188; Brown, J.H., On the relationship between abundance and distribution of species (1984) Am Nat, 124, pp. 255-279; Bchabot, B.F., Hicks, D.J., The ecology of leaf life spans (1982) Ann Rev Eco Sys, 13, pp. 229-260; Clavero, M., Garcia-Berthou, E., Invasive species are a leading cause of animal extinctions (2005) Trends Eco Evo, 20, pp. 110-115; Connell, J.H., Diversity in tropical rainforest and coral reefs (1978) Science, 199, pp. 1302-1310; Denslow, J.S., Tropical rainforest gaps and tree species diversity (1987) Ann Rev Eco Sys, 18, pp. 431-452; Fisher, J.B., Tan, H.T.W., Toh, L.P.L., Xylem of attansr : vessel dimensions in climbing palms (2002) Am J Bot, 89, pp. 196-202; Grime, J.P., (2002) Plant Strategies and Vegetation Processes, , New York (US): John Wiley and Sons; He, F., Legendre, P., LaFrankie, J.V., Distribution patterns of tree species in a Malaysian tropical rainforest (1997) J Veg Sci, 8, pp. 105-114; He, F., Gaston, K.J., Estimating species abundance from occurrence (2000) Am Nat, 156, pp. 553-559; Hellmann, J.J., Byers, J.E., Bierwagen, B.G., Dukes, J.S., Five potential consequences of climate change for invasive species (2008) Con Bio, 22, pp. 534-543; Hooper, E.R., Legendre, P., Condit, R., Factors affecting community composition of forest regeneration in deforested, abandoned land in Panama (2004) Ecology, 85, pp. 3313-3326; Janzen, D.H., Herbivores and the number of tree species in tropical forest (1970) Am Nat, 104, pp. 501-528; Josekutty, P.C., Wakuk, E.E., Joseph, M.J., Invasive/weedy angiosperms in Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia (2002) Micronesia Supp, 6, pp. 61-65; Kirkham, W.S., Situating the Merremia peltata invasion in Samoa (2004) Geo Rev, 94, pp. 218-228; Master, J., Tjitrosoedirdjo, S.S., Qayim, I., Tjitrosoedirdjo, S., Ecological impact of Merremia peltata (L.)

Further, degradation of tropical rain forest area reduces forest functions as global biological resources and affects livelihood of rural communities. To regain forest functions, a landscape restoration approach is needed. The research aimed to develop a restoration index model for degraded tropical forest landscapes in Batang Toru Watershed. The proposed restoration index was constructed by four indices i.e. forest degradation, forest connectivity, forest fragmentation, and socio economic indices. Regression analysis was conducted to develop models for four indices. Discriminant analysis was conducted to obtain restoration index model. The forest landscape fragmentation index increased in the period of 1989-2013, while connectivity index tended to decrease during the same period. Forest connectivity index had higher weight than other indices in calculating restoration index. This indicated that connectivity of Batang Toru forest landscape needed to be maintained and enhanced to ensure habitat quality and reduce loss of biodiversity. The research showed that Sarula Sub-watershed had high restoration index value, so it should be the first area tobe restored.","Connectivity; Forest ecosystem; Fragmentation; FRAGSTATS; Spatial",,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., Jenkins, C.N., (2006) Applying Nature's Design: Corridors as a Strategy for Biodiversity Conservation, , New York, (US): Columbia University Press; Apan, A.A., Steven, S.R., Mark, S.P., Mapping and analysis of changes in the riparian landscape structure of the Lockyer Valley catchment, Queensland, Australia (2002) Landscape Urban Planning, 59 (1), pp. 43-57; Batistella, M., Eduardo, S., Brondizio, Emilio, F., Moran, Comparative analysis of landscape fragmentation in Rondônia, Brazilian Amazon (2000) International Archives of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 33, pp. 148-155; Collinge, S.K., Effects of grassland fragmentation on insect species loss, colonization, and movement patterns (2000) Ecology, 81 (8), pp. 2211-2226; Cotler, H., Ortega-Larrocea, M.P., Effects of land use on soil erosion in a tropical dry forest ecosystem, Chamela watershed, Mexico (2006) Catena, 65, pp. 107-117; Crooks, K.R., Sanjayan, M., (2006) Connectivity Conservation, , New York, US: Cambridge University Press; Decout, S., Manel, S., Miaud, C., Luque, S., (2010), http://symposcience.org, Connectivity and landscape patterns in human dominated landscape:acase study with the common frog Rana temporaria; Fahrig, L., Effectof habitat fragmentationonbiodiversity (2003) Annu Revi Ecol, Evol, Syst, 34 (1), pp. 487-515; (2011) State of world's forest 2011, , Rome; (2002) The state of the forest Indonesia, , Bogor, 2002; Forman, R.T.T., Godron, M., (1986) Landscape Ecol, , New York (US): Wiley; Forman, R.T.T., (1195) Land Mosaics: The Ecology of Landscapes and Regions, , 2 Edition.

The waste would be potential for production of single cell oils (SCOs). The objective of this study was to evaluate lipid accumulation by fungi using POME as substrate. Seven filamentous fungi were initially isolated from various biomes. The study results showed that out of these 7 fungi, five of them produced endoglucanase and accumulated lipid about 34.3-87.5% of their dry cell mass using POME as substrate. The five fungi were identified as Flavodon flavus ATH, Aspergillus sp., Trichoderma sp., Fusarium sp. 1 T30, and Fusarium sp.2 T50. The highest lipid accumulation was obtained by Flavodon flavus ATH. The profile of trans-esterified SCOs revealed high content of saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids i.e., palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0) and oleic (C18:1) acids similar to conventional vegetable oils used for biodiesel production. The strain that was able to use organic substrates in POME indicated that they are promising strain for biofuel feedstock as well as for fulfilling effluent quality for wastewater discharge.","Fatty acid methyl ester;

By using bioindicators, it is possible to assess the impact of human activities on the biota, instead of examining the entire biota. In this paper we analyzed diversity of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) across land use gradient in Central Sulawesi and tested the suitability of dung beetles as bioindicators for environmental changes. Ninety baited pitfall traps were placed and several habitat parameters were measured at five land-use types ranging from natural forest to cacao agroforestry systems to open areas in 2009 and 2012. The effectiveness of dung beetles as bioindicators of environmental changes was evaluated by the IndVal method, a method combining the specificity and fidelity of certain species with particular types of habitat or environmental conditions. Surprisingly, the results showed that the diversity of dung beetles in two types of cacao plantations were similar to the forest sites and were significantly higher than the open cultivated area. Of the 16 dung beetles species analyzed only four species could be suggested as indicator (characteristic) species while the majority of collected species were categorized as detector species. Two of them (Copris saundersi and Onthophagus forsteni) were associated with natural forest and cacao agroforestry system, thus were suggested as the indicator of shaded and cooler habitats whereas O. limbatus and O. can be suggested as indicator of unshaded and warmer habitats (bare land area).","Bioindicators; Diversity; Habitat preferences; IndVal; Scarabaeidae",,,,,,,,"Andresen, E., Effects of Season and Vegetation Type on Community Organization of Dung Beetles in a Tropical Dry Forest (2005) Biotropica, 37 (2), pp. 291-300; Aydin, G., Kazak, C., Selecting indicator species habitat description and sustainable land utilization: a case study in a mediterranean delta (2010) International Journal of Agriculture & Biology, 12, pp. 931-934; Balthasar, V., Monographie der Scarabaeidae und Aphodiidae der palaearktischen und orientalischen Region.Band 1 (1963) Verlag der Tschechoslawakischen Akademie der Wissenschaften., , Prague; Brose, U., Martinez, N.D., Williams, R.J., Estimating species richness: sensitivity to sample coverage and insensitivity to spatial patterns (2003) Ecology, 84 (9), pp. 2364-2377; Clarke, K.R., Non- parametric multivariate analyses of changes in community structure (1993) Australian Journal Ecology, 18, pp. 117-143; Colwell, R.K., EstimateS: Statistical estimation of species richness and shared species from samples (2004), http://purl.oclc.org/estimates, Version 7.User's Guide and application; Davis, A.J., Holloway, J.D., Huijbregts, H., Krikken, J., Kirk-Spriggs, A.H., Sutton, S.L., Dung beetles as indicators of change in the forests of northern Borneo (2001) Journal of Applied Ecology, 38, pp. 593-616; Dufrêne, M., Legendre, P., Species assemblages and indicator species: the need for a flexible asymmetrical approach (1997) Ecological Monographs, 67, pp. 345-366; Errouissi, F., Haloti, S., Robert, P.J., Idrissi, A.J., Lumaret, J.P., Effect of the attractiveness for dung beetles of dung pat origin and size along climatic gradient (2004) Environ.

The plant produces most of its alkaloids in the bark after 68 years of age. Repeated harvests can be performed until the plant dies, but only after every 35 years. We tested an improved method for culturing cell suspensions of Cinchona ledgeriana investigate the possibility of increasing production of quinine. The clone QRC 315 was treated with either a growth retardant (abscisic acid or paclobutrazol) or precursor feeding of L-tryptophan. To generate stress, we applied mannitol at 5.3 g/L combined with sucrose at a lower concentration (20 g/L), and we used sucrose at 30 g/L as the control. Paclobutrazol (7 mg/L) significantly suppressed cell growth and produced the highest level of quinine (11%) after 7 weeks of culture. L-tryptophan also reduced cell growth, but without any positive effect in the production of quinoline. The highest amount of quinine per culture flask, however, resulted from cells treated with 3 mg/L abscisic acid.","Cinchona ledgeriana; Paclobutrazol; Quinine; Suspension culture","Cinchona; Cinchona calisaya",,,,,,,"Barrett, (1928), The Tropical Crops.

A 630 bp segment of mitochondrial DNA was amplified from 105 different Sumatran elephant samples from 5 locations in Sumatera (Bentayan, Sugihan, Bukit Salero Lahat, Seblat, Way Kambas) using a set of primers: MDL3 (5'-CCCACAATTAATGGGCCC-GGAGCG-3') and MDL5 (5'-TTACATGAATTGGCAGCCA-ACCAG-3'). The objectives of this study were to generate mitochondrial DNA D-loop sequences for all available Sumatran elephant samples and to define haplotypes and nucleotide sequence diversity of the different Sumatran elephant populations. The nucleotide sequence of a total of 105 PCR products were successfully determined with an average length of 616 bp. However, mitochondrial DNA fragments for this analysis used the first 601 bases. Six different haplotypes (BP, BT, BS, BR, BX and BY) were identified in Sumateran elephant populations. The majority of the sampled individuals carried haplotype BT. BX and BY are most likely novel derived haplotypes. All haplotypes, except for the haplotype BP belong to the Sumatera clade. The haplotype BX was derived from the haplotype BT, and the haplotype BY was derived from the haplotype BS by one transversion, respectively. All the other substitutions identified in this network were transitions. The haplotype BP is widely distributed from Sri Lanka, Sumatera, Peninsular Malay and China. Although reported to be distributed in Sumatera and Peninsular Malay the haplotype BU was not detected among the samples analysed in this study. Genetic distances within populations in Bentayan, Bukit Salero Lahat, Seblat, Sugihan and Way Kambas ranged from 0.0000 - 0003, and the genetic distance between the populations that is 0.0000 - 0.0022. The distance between haplotypes of different Sumatran elephant populations was shown to be low. The diversity of haplotypes and nucleotides in Sumatera Island were low, the highest diversity was found in elephants sampled in the region of Bukit Salero Lahat and the lowest was found in elephants from Bentayan and Sugihan. Overall, the results of analysis of Fu and Li's F*test statistic indicates that the population of Sumatran elephants in Sumatra is-0.78871, which suggests that there is no inbreeding. However, the results are not significant (P>0:10) and additional studies are required to confirm this finding.","Elephas maximus sumatranus; Haplotype; Mitochondrial DNA; Sumatran elephant",,,,,,,,"Akishinonomiya, F., Miyake, T., Sumi, S., Takada, M., Ohno, S., Kondo, N., (1994) One subspecies of the Red Jungle Fowl Gallus gallus gallus) suffices as the matriarchic ancestor of all domestic breeds, 91, pp. 12505-12509. , Proceedings National Academy of Sciences USA; Bandelt, H.J., Forster, P., Rohl, A., Median-joining networks for inferring intraspecific phylogenies (1999) Mol Biol Evol, 16, pp. 37-38; Brown, W.M., Prager, E.M., Wang, A., Wilson, A.C., Mitochondrial DNA sequences of primates: Tempo and mode of evolution (1982) J Mol Evol., 18, pp. 225-239; Eggert, L.S., Rasner, C.A., Woodruff, D.S., The evolution and phylogeography of the African elephant inferred from mitochondrial DNA sequence and nuclear microsatellite markers (2002) Biol Sci, 269 (1504), pp. 1993-2006. , Proceedings of the Royal SocietyLondon; Fernando, P., Lande, R., Molecular genetic and behavioural analysis of social organisation in the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus:) (2000) Behav Ecol Sociobio, L48, pp. 84-91; Fernando, P., Pfrender, M.E., Encalada, S.E., Lande, R., Mitochondrial DNA variation, phyleogeography and population structure of the Asian elephant (2000) Heredity, 84, pp. 362-72; Fernando, P., Vidya, T.N.C., Payne, J., Stuewe, M., Davison, G., Alfred, R.J., Andau, P., Melnick, D.J., DNA analysis indicates that Asian elephants are native to Borneo and are therefore a high priority for conservation (2003) Plos Biology, 1 (1), pp. 110-115; Fickel, J., Lieckfeldt, D., Ratanakorn, P., Pitra, C., Distribution of haplotypes and microsatellite alleles among Asian elephants (Elephasmaximus) in Thailand (2007) EurJ Wildlife Res, 53, pp. 298-303; Fleischer, R.C., Perry, E.A., Muralidharan, K., Stevens, E.E., Wemmer, C.M., Phyleogeography of the Asian elephant based on mitochondrialDNA (2001) 'Evolution, 55 (9), pp. 1882-1892; Ishida, N., Hasegawa, T., Takeda, K., Sagami, M., Onishi, A., Inumaru, S., Komatsu, M., Mukoyama, H., Polymorphic sequence in the D-loop region of equine mitochondrial DNA (1994) Animal Genetics., 25, pp. 215-221; Ishida, Y., Oleksyk, T.K., Georgiadis, N.J., David, V.A., Zhao, K., Stephens, R.M., Kolokotronis, S.O., Roca, A.L., Reconciling apparent conflicts between mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies in African elephants (2011) PLoS ONE, 6 (6), pp. E20642; Maddison, D.R., Maddison, W.P., MacClade 4: Analysis of phylogeny and character Evolution , 4.0.

The change of moisture contents o f sorghum grains was also recorded. Threshing was conducted using wooden stick and a paddy thresher. Sorghum grains were packed in hermetic plastic bags. The conditions inside of the bags were airtight and normal. Each bag with different conditions inside was infested with 10 pairs of S. zeamais (1-14 days old). Sorghum was stored for one, two and three months under warehouse conditions. The results showed, that the moisture contents o f sorghum were lower than its standard safe moisture content (&lt;14%) during storage. At the beginning of storage, the percentage of damaged grains caused by threshing using wooden stick was higher than that of using a paddy thresher. The increase of percentage o f damaged grains was caused among others by increase S. zeamais population under normal oxygen concentration inside of the bag (about 21%), consequently the percentage of weight loss was also increased. The percentage of seed germination of sorghum threshed using wooden stick was lower than that of threshed using a paddy thresher. The percentage of seed germination decreased with the increase of storage duration. Population of F.proliferatum and F. verticillioides decreased with the increase of storage duration. Fumonisin B1 content of sorghum threshed using wooden stick was higher than that of using a paddy thresher during one, two and three months o f storage. Fumonisin B1 contents were considered low. In general, carbohydrate content of sorghum threshed using either wooden stick or paddy thresher from the beginning up to three months o f storage were not significantly different. Threshing using a paddy thresher was better in comparison to threshing using wooden stick.","Postharvest quality; Sorghum; Sorghum bicolor",,,,,,,,"Abdel-Hafez, S.I.I., Moubasher, H., Shoreit, M., Ismail, M., Fungal flora associated with combine harvester wheat and sorghum dusts from Egypt (1990) J Basic Microbiol, 30, pp. 467-469; Bala, B.K., (1997) Drying and Storage of Cereal Grains, , New Hampshire: Science Publishers; Bucci, T.J., Kansen, D.K., Labord, J.B., Leukoencephalomalacia and hemorrhage in the brain of rabbits gavaged with mycotoxin fumonisin Bt (1996) Natural Toxins, 4, pp. 51-52; Christensen, C.M., Miller, B.S., Johnston, J.A., (1992) Moisture and Measurement.

The model was developed through three steps of analyses. The first step was to determine the length of periods used in prediction and optimal time for eradicating Aedes aegypti mosquito's breeding sites. The second step was to identify the best prediction model of dengue Incidence Rate (IR). The third step was to develop an early warning model using stochastic spreadsheet. It was found that the best predictor for predicting dengue incidence rate at week-n (IRn) was (1) rainfall index with two weeks lead time (ICHn-2). The rainfall index of week-nth is a function of three week moving averages rainfall (CH3), i.e. (CH3n-1.155*CH3n-1+0.702*CHn-2), and (2) IR with one week lead time (IRn-1). The IR model prediction was IRn = 0.795*IRn-1+0.067*ICHn-2 with R2=76.6%. These models (models resulted from the first and third steps) can be used to provide early warning on optimum time for controlling the mosquito's breeding sites and the need for fogging action in order to prevent the dengue incidence rate beyond the critical limit as defined by the Ministry of Health.","Aedes aegypti; Breeding site; Climate change; Climate variability; Early warning model; Time control",,,,,,,,"Christophers, S.R., (1960) Aedes aegypti (L) the Yellow Fever Mosquito.

The treatments consisted of two row spacings and three seed sizes for sowing. Soil water contents of six combination of treatments were measured weekly to the soil depth of 100 cm to calculate water loss by actual evapottanspiration and runoff. Water loss by ETa+Ro was much higher (average of 18.2 mm/day) compared to average potential evapotranspiration (7.5 mm/day).Despite high rainfall during the growing season (1314 mm), actual evapottanspiration could reduce soil water content to 60 cm soil depth due to the high runoff caused by limited capacity of water infiltration into the soil.

However, the Sangkuriang catfish showed different phenotype from their parental, that is African catfish. Therefore, taxonomic analysis is needed as to get a clearer picture about their taxonomic status and relationships with local and African catfish. Taxonomic study could be done using molecular markers as a taxonomic character. One of the molecular markers is randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) marker. Using RAPD, species status is defined based on die presence and absence of specific band on each catfish. Phylogenetics relationships was inferred from phylogenetic tree which was built using UPGMA tool as implemented in NTSYS software based on the similarity of RAPD band pattern. The result showed that Sangkuriang and local catfish had specific RAPD markers, while African catfish had not. This means that all RAPD markers of African catfish were shared with those of two other catfish. Local catfish was distantly related to African and Sangkuriang catfish. Only one African catfish (D4) was genetically related to Sangkuriang catfish, while the rest of African catfish samples were genetically related to green catfish. This means that African catfish showed a very divergence genetic constituent.","Clarias sp.; Molecular identification; Phylogenetic relationships; RAPD",,,,,,,,"Ackerman, E., Ellis, L.B.M., Williams, L.E., (1988) Biophysics.

The biological materials used for the experiment constituted of six commercial varieties: Dewi Sartika, Saraswati, Yellow Fiji, White Puma, Yellow Puma and White Reagent. Tissue culture initiation was conducted through plantlet establishment using MS supplemented with IAA. Ribavirin was added in media with the concentration of 40 mg/l on cv. Dewi Sartika, Saraswati and Yellow Fiji. Parallel with this step, heat treatment with different durations (1, 2, and 3 weeks) was also conducted on the plantlets on White Puma, Yellow Puma and White Reagent. Meristem culture was done following the chemo- and thermotherapy. The experiment resumed the failure of single treatment of meristem culture in eliminating CVB from the infected chrysanthemum plantlets. Under heat treatment, percentage of virus-free plantlets increased along with the duration of thermotherapy, though the survival rate of plantlets decreased in lengthened heat treatment. The best results regarding virus free plant percentagewere obtained when meristem culturewas applied following ribavirin or threeweeks of heat treatment.","Chemotherapy; Chrysanthemum virus-b (CVB); Heat treatment; Meristem culture; Virus-free",,,,,,,,"Batthacharyya, P., Dey, S., Das, N., Batthacharyya, B.C., Rapid mass propagation of Chrysanthemum morifolium callus derived from stem and leaf explans (1990) Plant Cell.

Here, we reported a total of 325 bp of 16S mitochondrial gene of S. incertulas from the obtained samples. Among all DNA sequences, three haplotypes of 16S mitochondrial gene were observed and submitted to Gen Bank under Accession Number of GU191881, GU191882, GU191883, respectively for haplotype 1, 2, and 3. The haplotype 1 was found in all S. incertulas surveyed locations, except Bogor. Haplotype 2 and 3 were found only in from Cirebon and Bogor samples. These haplotype variations can be applied as DNA markers for S. incertulas early larva detection method among other rice stem borers.

Palmyra palm (Borassus flabellifer) is highly potential to be developed as bioethanol source regarding the high sucrose content in its nira. It was observed that nira produced in dry season is sweeter than that in rainy season, which presumed to be influenced by a difference in expression level of sucrose-related genes during the two seasons. Study of Sucrose Synthase (SUS) gene of palmyra are therefore required prior to study of the gene expression. Palmyra SUS gene sequence is currently unavailable in GenBank, thereby pair of primers was designed from highly conserved region of SUS proteins among monocots. A 1866 bp partial cDNA fragment of SUS putative gene has been succesfully isolated from RNA of the young leaves of B. flabellifer. BLASTn and BLASTp aligments showed that either BfSUS cDNA or BfSUS polypeptide has high similarity with SUS cDNA and proteins from diverse plant species with the highest similarity shown by Tulipa gesneriana. The phylogenetic tree showed that SUS protein sequences of monocot species were distinctively grouped and splitted from those of dicot species. The BfSUS was clustered in monocot group, although not specifically grouped with particular monocot species. Nevertheless, B. flabellifer showed nearest genetic distance with Tulipa gesneriana and Oncidium cv. 'Goldiana'. Characterization of BfSUS polypeptide using Geneious 4.6.2 indicated the presence of sucrose synthase (SUS) and glycosyl transferase (GT) domains, four putative UDP-glucose binding pockets within the GT domain, and a calcium-dependent Ser/Thr protein kinase binding site within the SUS domain. These domains and motifs are highly conserved in SUS proteins across plant species, confirming that the cDNA fragment obtained in this study is very likely cDNA encodes sucrose synthase in B. flabellifer.","Borassus flabellifer; GT domain; Nira; Palmyra palm; Sucrose; Sucrose synthase; SUS domain","Borassus aethiopum; Borassus flabellifer; Dicotyledoneae; Liliopsida; Oncidium Goldiana; Palmyra; Tulipa; Tulipa gesneriana",,,,,,,"Altschul, S.F., Madden, T.L., Schäffer, A.A., Zhang, J., Zhang, Z., Miller, W., Lipman, D.J., Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs (1997) Nucleic Acids Res, 25, pp. 3389-3402; Apt, K.E., Clendennen, S.K., Powers, D.A., Grossman, A.R., The gene family encoding the fucoxanthin chlorophyll proteins from the brown alga Macrocystis pyrifera (1995) Mol.

Various parts of flower namely petal, sepal, style, ovary, pistil and cup base were cultured onto Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium supplemented with different level of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 6-Furfurylaminopurine (kinetin). It was found that different part of flowers favored different level of hormone for callus induction. The highest formation of callus were obtained from petal and sepal cultured on MS media supplemented with 1.5 mg/l kinetin. For the style and pistil, 50 ± 2.3% of the explants had developed callus when cultured on MS media supplemented with 0.05 mg/l and 0.10 mg/l BAP respectively.

The purpose of this study was to find the proper dosage of dopamine to improve the quality for breeding of the disqualified tiger prawn, because dopamine inhibits maturation, so there will be enough time for maturation and improvement of the eggs quality. This experiment used 15 pairs of the twice breeding tiger prawn, which was collected from -9 Perigi (Central Java). The samples were treated with different dosages of dopamine (dosage 10-9, 10-8, 10-7, 10-6 moll and control/injected with aquabidest). The parameters identified in this experiment were duration (days) for eggs maturation, fecundity, fertilizing rate, hatching rate, egg diameter and phototaxis response of the nauplii. The research concluded that the average duration for eggs maturation on the broodstock that were injected with dopamine, dosage 10-9, 10-8, 10-7, 10-6 moll and control, were 14, 12, 4, 2, 5 days, respectively.

This research was aimed to study the effect of initial moisture content, packaging material and storage period on succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase activities. The experimental design used was Factorial Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD), consisting of three factors, i.e. moisture content (8. 10 and 12 percent), packaging materials (polyethylene, wheat and aluminium foil), storage period (0,1,2,3,4,5, and 6 months). Changes in seed water contents, specific activities of succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase, germination and coefficients velocity of germination, were monthly determined. It was found that decrease of succinate dehydrogenase specific activity can be induced if initial seed water content is raised above 8%. Soybean seeds stored in aluminium foil bags showed high succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase specific activities, viability, coefficient of velocity of germination and could maintain the seeds at a low moisture content to delay seed deterioration compared to seeds stored in polyethylene and wheat bags. © 2010 Seameo Biotrop.","Cytochrome oxidase; Moisture content; Soybean; Succinate dehydrogenase",,,,,,,,"Abu Shakra, S.S., Ching, T.M., Mitochondria activity in germinating new and old soybean seed (1967) Crop Sci, 7, pp. 115-118; Attuci, S., Carde, J.P., Raymond, P., Saint-Ges, V., Speteri, A., Pradet, A., Oxidative phosphorylation by mitochondria extracted from dry sunflower seeds (1991) Plant physioL, 95, pp. 390-398; Bewley, J.D., Black, M., (1982) Physiology and Biochemistry of Seed in Relation to Germination, 2, p. 37. , Springer-Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg.

Initial study of random transposon-based mutagenesis generated 62 nonmagnetic mutants of AMB-1 in a mini-Tn5 library. In order to identify a gene involved in bacterial magnetic particle (BMP) synthesis in the magnetic bacterium M. magneticum AMB-1, a nonmagnetic mutant from the library designated as NMA38-4, was analyzed. The amino acid sequence deduced from the gene directly interrupted by transposon, ORF4 (1482 bp), showed homology to ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter of Mesorhizobium loti with 62 % identity and 74 % similarity. It was strongly indicated by the occurrence of putative consensus sequence of ATP-binding motifs (ATPbinding protein). The ORF4 was subsequently cloned in pET-15b and the recombinant ORF4- Histag fusion protein was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS. A 55 kDa protein corresponding to the ORF4-Histag fusion protein was obtained after purification using Ni-NTA column. This is the first report describing a gene cluster containing gene encoding protein belonging to ABC transporter organized in an operon which is involved in BMP synthesis. © 2009, Seameo Biotrop.","ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) Transporter; Bacterial Magnetic Particle (BMP); Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1; Transposon mutagenesis",,,,,,,,"Altchul, S.F., Madden, T.L., Scaffer, A.A., Zhang, J., Zhang, Z., Miller, W., Lipman, D.J., Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs (1997) Nucleic Acids Research, 25, pp. 3389-3402; Blakemore, R.P., Magnetotactic bacteria (1975) Science, 190, pp. 377-379; Blakemore, R.P., Maratea, D., Wolf, R.S., Isolationand pure culture of a fresh water magnetic spirillum in defi ned growth medium (1979) Journal of Bacteriology, 140, pp. 720-729; Bearden, S.W., Stagg, T.M., Perry, R.D., An ABC transporter system of Yersinia pestis allows utilization of chelated iron by Escherichia coli SAB11 (1998) Journal of Bacteriology, 180, pp. 1135-1147; Berson, A.E., Hudson, D.V., Waleh, N.S., Cloning of a sequence of Aquaspirillum magnetotacticum that complements the aroD gene of Escherichia coli (1991) Molecular Microbiology, 5, pp. 2261-2264; Berson, A.E., Hudson, D.V., Waleh, N.S., Cloning and ccharacterization of the recA gene of Aquaspirillum magnetotacticum (1989) Archives of Microbiology, 152, pp. 567-571; Brown, J.S., Ogunniyi, A.D., Woodrow, M.C., Holden, D.W., Paton, J.C., Immunization with components of two iron uptake ABC transporters protects mice against systemic Streptococcus pneumoniae infection (2001) Infection and Immunity, 69, pp. 6702-6706; Brown, J.S., Gilliland, S.M., Holden, D.W., A Streptococcus pneumoniae pathogenicity island encoding an ABC transporter involved in iron uptake and virulence (2001) Molecular Microbiology, 40, pp. 572-585; DeBruijn, F.J., Lupski, J.R., Th e use of transposon Tn5 mutagenesis in the rapid generation of correlated physical and genetic maps of DNA segments cloned into multi copy plasmids-a review (1984) Gene, 27, pp. 131-149; Dugourd, D., Martin, C., Rioux, C.R., Jacques, M.M., Harel, J., Characterization of a periplasmic ATPbinding cassette iron import system of Bracyspira (Serpulina) hyodysentriae (1999) Journal of Bacteriology, 181, pp. 6948-6957; Fetherson, J.D., Bertolino, V.J., Perry, R.D., YbtP and YbtQ: two ABC transporters required for iron uptake in Yersinia pestis (1999) Molecular Microbiology, 32, pp. 289-299; Gong, S., Bearden, S.W., Geoffroy, V.A., Fetherson, J.D., Perry, R.D., Characterization of the Yersinia pestis Yfu ABC inorganic iron transport system (2001) Infection and Immunity, 67, pp. 2829-2837; Gorby, Y.A., Beveridge, T.J., Blakemore, R.P.R.P., Characterization of the bacterial magnetosome membrane (1988) Journal of Bacteriology, 170, pp. 834-841; Janulczyk, R., Pallon, J., Bjorck, L., Identifi cation and characterization of Streptococcus pyogenes ABC transporter with multiple specifi city for metal cations (1999) Molecular Microbiology, 34, pp. 596-606; Khun, H.H., Kirby, S.D., Lee, B.C., A Neisseria meningitidis fbpABC mutant is incapable of using nonheme iron for growth (1998) Infection and Immunity, 66, pp. 2330-2336; Klecker, N., Roth, J., Botstein, D., Genetic engineering in vivo using translocatable drug-resistance element: new method in bacterial genetic (1977) Journal of Molecular Biology, 116, pp. 125-159; Matsunaga, T., Application of bacterial magnets (1991) Trends in Biotechnology, 9, pp. 91-95; Matsunaga, T., Sakaguchi, T., Todokoro, F., Magnetite formation by a magnetic bacterium capable of growing aerobically (1991) Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, 35, pp. 651-655; Matsunaga, T., Nakamura, C., Burgess, J.G., Sode, K., Gene transfer in magnetic bacteria: Transposon mutagenesis and cloning of genomic DNA fragments required for magnetite synthesis (1992) Journal of Bacteriology, 174, pp. 2748-2753; Nakamura, C., Burgess, J.G., Sode, K., Matsunaga, T., An iron-regulated gene, magA, encoding an iron transport protein of Magnetospirillum sp.

Five kinds of experimental diets were used in this experiment, namely diets A, B, C, D and E. Diet A, as a control, was supplemented with inorganic P, without phytase supplementation. Diet B, C, D and E were supplemented with 0, 20, 40 and 60 mg phytase/100 g soybean meal (SBM), respectively, without inorganic P supplementation. Fifteen fish with initial body weight of 6.9 + 0.2 g were stocked into each 60-l aquarium. Fish were fed on the diets for 60 days. Results indicated that P digestibility increased from 64.5% to 87.0% as phytase supplement increased from 0 mg in diet B to 60 mg phytase/100 g SBM in diet E. P digestibility in diet E was higher than that in diet A (77.6%). The daily growth rate and feed conversion ratio followed similar trend. P, Ca and Zn concentration in the whole body and bone of fish fed diet E were higher than the fish fed diet B, C and D, but were insignificant compared to the fish fed diet A. Nitrogen (N) and P loading by fish fed diet E were, respectively, 76% and 20% lower than those in fish fed the control diet. It is concluded that the inclusion of 60 mg phytase/100 g SBM in the diet of the green catfish could replace the utilization of inorganic P increase the digestibility of the diet thereby resulting in increased growth rate and reduced excretion of P and N into the waters. © 2008, Seameo Biotrop.","Hemibagrus nemurus; Phosphorus; Phytase; Soybean meal",,,,,,,,"Baruah, K., Sahu, N.P., Pal, A.K., Debnath, D., Dietary phytase: an ideal approach for a cost effective and low-polluting aquafeed.

It serves the environments by preventing natural disaster (flooding), maintaining the quality of the water body and filter or treats the pollutants naturally. Efficient bryodiversity management is needed for environmental cost cutting and have a cost-effective management strategy. To achieve this, cluster and principal component analyses (PCA) were manipulated to produce the linkage distance between the OTUs and identify the important groups of characters, respectively. In return, it becomes a guideline for bryoflora and environmental managements. In this study, 23 OTUs and 156 characters were analyzed. The output from the reliability and item analysis showed that the data set is highly reliable (Cronbach's alpha = 0.9627). From the cluster analysis, it showed that 5 clustered groups (manageable units) could be derived from the produced phenogram. This is based on the nearest neighbour amalgation rule and Euclidean distances. As for the principal component analysis, three factors were derived and explained 75.1064% of the variation with 56.0485%(PC1), 11.7346%(PC2) and 7.3233%(PC3), respectively. The ordination showed that 5 manageable units were derived from PC1 and 3 manageable units for PC2 and PC3, respectively.

A. malaccensis is susceptible to white rot diseases and termites. On the other hand most of the community plantations are a mixed culture with rubber trees, oil palms and with high risk of contamination causing white root diseases. Besides that, vegetative propagation by cuttings, stumping or air layering are still very difficult with low percentage of growth. The objectives of this research were to analyze the best suitable micrograft type, changes of SDS-PAGE protein band patterns of compatible and incompatible micrografts with several combinations of gaharu planlets in in vitro condition, and histology of union area between rootstocks and scion. The results showed that wedge or V type was the best of the micrografs. MS medium with the addition of 3 mg/L IBA was the best medium for gaharu planlet growth after micrografting. Acclimatization was conducted in husk chacoal and top soil (1:1) medium and grown under plastic house of 70% shading with paranet. Compatible combination (Ac/Am) of micrografting showed that anatomy structure of union area is the same as anatomy structure of non micrograftd planlet. While incompatible (Gv/Am) micrografting produced necrotic layer growth from pith and parenchymateous tissues of the wood in union area along the middle of radial shoot. Recovery period of union area between stocks and scion is initiated by callus formation from the pith and parenchymatous tissues of the wood. Callus will differentiate into mature cells or tissue and become combined phloem and xylem vessels between rootstocks and scion. SDS-PAGE protein band pattern on compatible combination was the same as plants originated from seedlings. While, incompatible combination produced new protein bands with molecular weight around 21 and 30 kD. © 2008, Seameo Biotrop.","Agarwood; Aquilaria spp; Incompatible histology; Incompatible micrografting; Micrografting in vitro; SDSPAGE protein",,,,,,,,"Cultivating the world's most expensive incense (2002) eNews 25 July, 2002, pp. 2-3. , http://www.umn.edu/systemwids/enews/072502.html, [25 Agustus 2002]; Bertrand, B., Etienne, H., Growth, production, and bean quality of Coffea Arabica as affected by interspecifi c grafting: Consequences for rootstock breeding (2001) Journal of Horticulture Science, 36, pp. 269-273; Bradford, M.M., A rapid and sensitive methods for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding (1976) Analytical Biochemistry, 72, pp. 248-254; (2003) Review of signifi cant trade Aquilaria malaccensis, , http//www.cites.org/eng/cttee/pc/14/E.PC14.09.02.02.Az.pdf; Da Costa, W.M., Gonlcalvez, W., Fazouli, C., Producao do cafe' Mundo Novo em portaenxertos de Coffea canephora em area infestada com Meloidogyne incognita raca 1 (1991) Nematologia Brasileira, 15, pp. 43-50; De Abreu, M.F., de Oliveira, N.J.C., Santos, M., Pedrotti, E.L., Preliminaries histological studies from the micrografting of tissue cultured apple (2003) Revista Brasileira Fruticultura, 25 (1). , Jaboti Cabal April; Errea, P., Garay, L., Marin, A.J., Early detection of graft incompatibility in Apricot (Prunus armeniaca) using in vitro techniques (2001) Physiologia Planarum, 112, pp. 135-141; Estrada-Luna, A.A., Lopez-Peralpa, C., Cardenas-Soriano, E., In vitro micro grafting and the histology of graft union formation of selected species of prikly pear caktus (Opuntia spp.) (2002) Scientia Horticulturae, 92, pp. 317-327; Essau, K., (1965) Plant anatomy, , 2nd Edition.

The result showed that all drying cultures were recovered well and retained their characters such as good growth, pigmentation and production of fruit bodies (ascomata), sexual spores (ascospores) and asexual spores. Several cultures showed its good growth in 20% ethanol medium. This study also reported successful purification of cultures from fungal contamination using ethanol-soaking treatment. This self-drying method, therefore, could be suggested as a good long-term preservation method for Monascus cultures.

Originally, the EFB fibres were heterogeneous, and rolled up in compacted wads in a disorderly fashion, with fibre lengths of approximately 50 mm to more than 200 mm. The moisture content and density of these fibres were approximately 12.7% and 18.1 kg/m 3 , respectively. For the production of thermal insulation material (patent DE 43 16901 Al with some modifications) the EFB fibres were cut and needles, dust and dirt were removed to improve the homogeneity of the raw material. Potassium water glass and water were used as a binding agent and as a solvent, respectively. Carbon dioxide gas and hot air (60°C) were blown through the fibres in a fumigation room to cure the waterglass and produce a hardened fibre sheet. The results of this study were gathered from the information on the characteristics of the cut EFB fibres as a raw material (incl. fibre length distribution, density, moisture and oil content), physical properties (incl. moisture content, density and thermal conductivity) and the technical aspects of insulation material production. According to the results obtained, moisture content and density of the cut EFB fibres were approximately 11.36% and 40.5 kg/m 3 , respectively. Density of the insulation material was approximately 116.4 kg/m 3 with thermal conductiv-ity between 0.049 and 0.054 W/mK. Using cut EFB fibres as raw material for the insulation material production technique appear to be technically acceptable based on this investigation and the above mentioned patent. EFB fibre insulation material is also acceptable as an environmcntally-friendly insulation material for building purposes according to the insulation for buildings requirement DIN 4102-1 (1981). © 2017 BIOTROPIA - The Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Biology.","Empty fruit-bunch; Fibre; Insulation material; Oil palm; Potassium-water glass",,,,,,,,"(1983) ASTM D2016-74, Statndard method of test for moisture content of wood; (1989) ASTM D2395-93, Statndard test methods for specific gravity of wood and wood-base materials; Bynum, T.J.R., (2001) Insulation Handbook, pp. 21-29 and 33-49. , McGraw-Hill.

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) declared in 1992, in which the issue on invasive alien species was raised, was ratified by the Indonesian Government in 1994. Protecting our biodiversity will be out moral obligation to comply with CBD. Inventory on the invasive alien plant species in Indonesia should also be done by field surveys aside from the data collected from the references and herbarium specimens. Field studies should be carried out to get complete Figures, to identify the new ones, to determine their distributions, to plan their management including prevention to spread, containment and movement or mitigate their impact to environment. Sometimes it is difficult in determining whether the plants are aliens or not. Cooperation with botanists and taxonomists in other parts of the world is necessary. There are some species of invasive alien plant in Indonesia, which have to be watched fortheir aggressiveness i.e. Acasia nilotica (L.)

The aim of this research was to study the development of mud crab (Scylla olivaceous) oocytes cultured in in vitro medium supplemented with thoracic ganglion extracts of Neoepisesarma lafondi. Immature crabs with 110 mm carapace width were collected from the mouth of Bawana Marana Rivers, Maros Regency of South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Pieces of ovarian tissues from those crabs were incubated within 24 hours in culture medium (Medium-199 with 100 IU/ml Penicillin-G) supplemented with 2 mg/ml thoracic ganglion extract. Result showed that the diameter of mud crab oocytes was increased in congruent with the incubation time. The development was prominent after in vitro incuba-tion for 8 hours (P < 0.05).

The gfp gene was inserted into pl/ClSNot and pUTmini-Tn.') to generate a recombinant plasmid pWG02 and p\VG03, respectively; which was transferred into the three isolates of V. han'eyi employing diparental mating. Recombinant E. coli carrying p\VG02 and pWG03 resulted in green-fluorescent colonies and cells due to the production of GFP. However, all of mini-Tn.J, including mini-Tn.5-gfp were not successfully transferred to V. harveyi. Therefore, we used mini-Tn/fl (pLOFKm-gfp) for inserting of gfp gene into V. han'eyi genome.

Researches in high mountain lakes deal with measuring and modeling the response of the habitats to environmental changes especially correlated to acid deposition, pollutants influx and climatic variability. The microbial world has also become a focus in many studies of these extreme ecosystems. Despite the pressure of harsh and extreme conditions, microbial communities living in these habitats developed flexible strategies and show quick adaptation to climate oscillation.

Workers obtain their food directly from wood, humus, and other substances that contain cellulose. The objective of this study was to examine the alimentary canal of the Neotermes bosei workers. Observations of gut transverse section were carried out through the length, perimeter, and area of each alimentary canal region. The results showed that total length of N. bosei alimentary canal was 13.71+1.28 mm. The canal was divided into fore-, mid-, and hindgut which were 24, 28, and 48%, respectively of the gut total length. Two types of alimentary canal epithelial cells were found, i.e. the squamous and transitional cells. Areas covered with thick muscular tissues were crop, proventriculus, and rectum. Proventriculus was characterized with six large dentitions. There was no gastric caeca in N. bosei midgut, which commonly occurred in chewing insect. Secretory cells .were observed at proventriculus and ventriculus regions. Cardiac valve was found at the anterior end of ventriculus. Area with the largest outer perimeter was the rectum pouch. Enteric valve had three internal folds. © 2006, Seameo Biotrop.","Alimentary canal; Drywood termites; Histology; Kalotermitidae",,,,,,,,"Ahmad, M., Termites (Isoptera) of Thailand (1965) Bull. Amer.

Culture independent techniques (PCR-based analyses) were used for detection and molecular characterization of a large number of bacteria most of which are still uncultivable. Bacterial community shifts over three ecological conditions (nutrients, light and oxygen availability) were detected by using Temporal Temperature gradient Gel Electrophoresis (TTGE) of a PCR-amplified part of the 16S rRNA gene.

ICM cells were isolated from the donor blastocyst by immunosurgery method. Zona-free blastocysts were incubated in the medium (TCM-199) containing 20% of the heat-inactivated rabbit anti-bovine-serum. The embryo reconstruction was produced by three different methods. Recipient blastocyst was maintained on the holding pipette by gentle suction, with the ICM in a 9 o'clock position to have the possibility of developing incorporate ICMs (Method I), the ICM was in a 3 o'clock position to break the original ICM during injection (Method 2); cutting the original recipient ICM followed by insertion of the donor ICM (Method 3). Reconstructed blastocysts were then cultured overnight and examined morphologically according to the re-expansion of the reconstructed blastocyst with or without developed donor ICM. According to morphological observation in this study, 37.9% of the reconstructed blastocyst developed with the incorporation of two ICM originally from recipient and donor (Method I), 66.7% of the reconstructed blastocysts developed with a single ICM (Method 2), and 80.0% of the reconstructed blastocyst developed from the ICM originally from donor ICM (Method 3). These results showed that the reconstructed blastocyst is better produced by cutting the original recipient ICM followed by the insertion of the donor ICM (Method 3). © 2006, Seameo Biotrop.","Bovine; Embryo reconstruction; ICM transfer; Immunosurgery",,,,,,"Louisiana State University, LSU","The author would like to thank Dr. Robert A.
