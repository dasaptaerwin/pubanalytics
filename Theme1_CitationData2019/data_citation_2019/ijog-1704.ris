AB  - The characteristic of Cimandiri Fault Zone has not been completely defined despite plenty of studies had already been accomplished. Therefore, an audio-magnetotelluric modeling was carried out. An audiomagnetotelluric survey was conducted at two parallel lines (N166Â°E) that intersected Cimandiri Fault Zone in Cibeber area, Cianjur. The distance between those two lines was 4.5 km and each line consisted of twenty-one stations with the distance between stations was 500 m. From the acquired forty-two apparent resistivity curves, inversion was executed to obtain two models. The models indicate layers with resistivity value of > 1000 ohm.m at about 500 m depth at both lines, which are associated to the basement layer. Columns of low resistivity zones in about the middle of each model represent fault zones as the weak zones of the area, and both models displayed them slightly dip southward as thrust faults.

AB  - Rising sea levels since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), some ~20,000 years ago, has drowned the Sunda Shelf and generated the complex coastal morphology as seen today. The pattern of drowning of the shelf will be utilized to assess likely timing of shoreline displacements and the duration of shelf exposure during the postglacial sea level rise. From existing sea level records around Sunda Shelf region, "sea level curve" was assembled to reconstruct the shelf drowning events. A five stage drowning model is proposed, including 1) maximum exposure of the shelf at approximately 20,500 years Before Present (y.B.P.), when sea level had fallen to about -118 m below present sea level (bpl.), 2) melt water pulse (MWP) 1A at ~14,000 y.B.P. when sea level rose to about -80 m bpl., 3) melt water pulse (MWP) 1B at ~11,500 y.B.P., when sea level was predicted around -50 m bpl., 4) Early-Holocene at ~9,700 y.B.P, when sea level was predicted at about-30 m bpl, and 5) sea level high stand at ~4,000 y.B.P., when sea level jumped to approx. +5 m above present sea level (apl.). This study shows that the sea level fluctuated by more than 120 m at various times during LGM and Holocene. Also confirmed that sea level curve of Sunda seems to fit well when combined with sea level curve From Barbados, although the comparison remains controversial untill now due to the considerable distinction of technic and hydro-isostatic settings.

AB  - In Semarang City, groundwater has been exploited as a natural resource since 1841. The groundwater exploited in deep wells is concentrated in confined aquifers. The previous hydrogeological model was developed in one unit of aquifer and refined then by using several hydrostratigraphical units following a regional hydrogeological map without any further analysis. At present, there is a lack of precise hydrogeological model which integrates geological and hydrogeological data, in particular for multiple aquifers in Semarang. Thus, the aim of this paper is to develop a hydrogeological model for the multiple aquifers in Semarang using an integrated data approach. Groundwater samples in the confined aquifers have been analyzed to define the water type and its lateral distribution. Two hydrogeological cross sections were then created based on several borelog data to define a hydrostratigraphical unit (HSU). The HSU result indicates the hydrogeological model of Semarang consists of two aquifers, three aquitards, and one aquiclude. Aquifer 1 is unconfined, while Aquifer 2 is confined. Aquifer 2 is classified into three groups (2a, 2b, and 2c) based on analyses of major ion content and hydrostratigraphical cross sections. Â© IJOG - 2016.

AB  - Lingga Regency is located in the main range of the famous Southeast Asia granitic belt related to tin resources. There are two granitic units in this region: the S-type Muncung Granite and I-type Tanjungbuku Granite. XRF and ICP-MS were used to measure the major, trace, and rare earth elements of nine Muncung Granite samples. Two different patterns were identified from major data plotting on Harker variation diagram. Granitic rocks from Lingga and Selayar Islands are classified as A facies while others from Singkep Island is B facies. This paper used graphs and variation diagrams to reveal the differences of those two facies. Thus, REE correlation to SiO2, trace element spider diagram, and REE spider diagram show more contrasts correlation. However, both facies are syn-collisional and High-K calc-alkaline granites. Some identical characters with other granitic units in Peninsular Malaysia were also detected in this work.

AB  - The gold-silver ores of western Java reflect a major metallogenic event during the Miocene-Pliocene and Pliocene ages. Mineralogically, the deposits can be divided into two types i.e. Se- and Te-type deposits with some different characteristic features. The objective of the present research is to summarize the mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of Se- and Te-type epithermal mineralization in western Java. Ore and alteration mineral assemblage, fluid inclusions, and radiogenic isotope studies were undertaken in some deposits in western Java combined with literature studies from previous authors. Ore mineralogy of some deposits from western Java such as Pongkor, Cibaliung, Cikidang, Cisungsang, Cirotan, Arinem, and Cineam shows slightly different characteristics as those are divided into Se- and Te-types deposits. The ore mineralogy of the westernmost of west Java region such as Pongkor, Cibaliung, Cikidang, Cisungsang, and Cirotan is characterized by the dominance of silver-arsenic-antimony sulfosalt with silver selenides and rarely tellurides over the argentite, while to the eastern part of West Java such as Arinem and Cineam deposits are dominated by silver-gold tellurides. The average formation temperatures measured from fluid inclusions of quartz associated with ore are in the range of 170 - 220Â°C with average salinity of less than 1 wt% NaClequiv. for Se-type and 190 - 270Â°C with average salinity of ~2 wt% NaClequiv. for Te-type.

AB  - The increasing demand for Rare Earth Elements (REE) is related to the continous development of technology, and these elements are used in modern equipments. REE can occur in igneous and sedimentary rocks in significant amounts as primary deposits, whereas the secondary REE deposit can be produced by intensive lateritic weathering of bedrocks under the tropical or subtropical climate. Lateritic process can increase REE concentration from sub-economic levels in host rocks to be more valuable. Muncung Granite is located in a tropical area of Lingga Regency, Riau Islands Province. REE occurs in the Muncung Granite and in weathered layers (saprolite, laterite, and soil). ICP-MS was applied to measure the REE content in all samples of this study. The average REE content of the Muncung Granite is 265 ppm with Eu anomaly in REE's spider diagrams. Lateritization process has increased REE content by more than four times compared to that in the Muncung Granite. Ce and Eu anomalies in weathered layers can be associated with weathering process and initial REE contents in the host rock. Ce anomaly in a laterite layer is found to have a negative correlation to REE total enrichment. The REE level in the Muncung Granite is higher than the content in the soil and saprolite layers, but lower than that in the laterite. Â© IJOG - 2016.

AB  - An assessment of surface rupture and collateral ground failures can help to evaluate the impact of future earthquakes. This paper presents the results of a field survey conducted to map the surface rupture and geotechnical phenomena associated with the ground shaking during the July 2, 2013 earthquakes in Tanah Gayo Highland. The objectives of this survey are to document and to characterize the surface ruptures as well as to identify types of earthquake-induced ground failures. Results of the survey identified four best sites of possible surface rupture. Two locations are obvious surface ruptures that can be traced on primary topographic feature of the active fault segment from the north to the south, crossing Pantan Terong Hill. The fault segment has a total mapped length of 19 km, with WNW trending zone and a dextral rupture offset. The ground shaking also resulted in landslides and liquefaction in areas underlain by very fine-grained tuffaceous sands. Based on the field survey, it can be concluded that the newly defined active fault segment, the Pantan Terong segment, is likely the segment that ruptured at the July 2, 2013 Tanah Gayo earthquake. Due to the soil types and unstable rocky slopes in the hilly Central Aceh region, large-scale landslides are primary risks during an earthquake event in this region. Â© IJOG - 2016.

AB  - The development in modern-high technology application is growing rapidly, resulting in the constant supply of critical metal and rare earth elements (REE). Currently, resources of these elements are restricted and new source of these elements need to be discovered accordingly. Scandium (Sc) as one of critical metals is an important metal for electrolyte of solid oxide fuel cells and other advance technology. In addition, REE are the important elements in the use of permanent magnets and rechargeable batteries. This manuscript reports an overview on the possibility of scandium and rare earth element occurrences in Sulawesi. Sc is concentrated in limonite layers in Soroako ultramafic rocks as a result of Fe3+ site substitution of mafic minerals (pyroxene, amphibole, etc.) during a laterization process. REE are enriched in association with clay minerals in B horizon from heavily weathered granitic rocks in Palu and Masamba, suggesting the possibility of ion-adsorption style mineralization. The lateritic soil of the ultramafic rocks and the weathered crusts of the granitic rocks in Sulawesi could be the potential sources of scandium and rare earth elements, respectively. Â© IJOG - 2016.

AB  - Radon and thoron exhalation rate from soil is one of the most important factors that can influence the radioactivity level in the environment. Radon and thoron gases are produced by the decay of the radioactive elements those are radium and thorium in the soil, where its concentration depends on the soil conditions and the local geological background. In this paper, the results of radon and thoron exhalation rate measurements from surface soil of Bangka Belitung Islands at thirty six measurement sites are presented. Exhalation rates of radon and thoron were measured by using an accumulation chamber equipped with a solid-state alpha particle detector. Furthermore, the correlations between radon and thoron exhalation rates with their parent nuclide (226Ra and 232Th) concentrations in collected soil samples from the same locations were also evaluated. The result of the measurement shows that mostly the distribution of radon and thoron is similar to 226Ra and 232Th, eventhough it was not a good correlation between radon and thoron exhalation rate with their parent activity concentrations (226Ra and 232Th) due to the environmental factors that can influence the radon and thoron mobilities in the soil. In comparison to a world average, Bangka Belitung Islands have the 222Rn and 220Rn exhalation rates higher than the world average value for the regions with normal background radiation.

AB  - To anticipate the increasing energy demand, additional data and information covering unconventional fossil fuels such as oil shale must be acquired to promote the usage of alternative energy sources to crude oil. The Talawi and Lubuktaruk regions situated within intra-montane Ombilin Basin, and the Kiliranjao area assumed to be located in a small intra montane Kiliranjao Sub-basin are occupied by Eo-Oligocene sediments of Sangkarewang and Kiliran Formations, respectively. Field activity, geochemical screening techniques, and organic petrographic analysis, supported by SEM mode, are methods used. Most of the oil shale sequence is typically of an organically rich-succession comprising predominantly well-bedded, laminated and fissile, brownish to dark grey organic-rich shales and mudstones. The exinite macerals within oil shale comprise mainly Pediastrum-lamalginite with minor cutinite, resinite, liptodetrinite, sporinite, bituminite, and rare Botryococcus-telalginite. Therefore, the oil shale deposits can be described as "lamosites". Minor vitrinite maceral is also recognized. TOC analysis on selected shale samples corresponds to a fair up to excellent category of source rock characterization. The kerogen is suggested to be of mixed Type II and Type I autochthonous materials such as alginite, with minor allochthonous substances. Oil samples collected appear to be positioned within more oil prone rather than gas prone. Thermal maturity of the oil shales tends to show an immature to marginally/early mature stage. By evaluating all the results of geochemical and organic petrological analyses conducted on shale lithologies (shale and mudstone), it can be concluded that the oil shales in those areas are effective source rocks having a favourable potential for generating shale oil or gas to be included as alternative energy resources in the future.

AB  - A numerical model has demonstrated that it can simulate reasonably well earthquake motions at the ground level during a seismic event. The most widely used model is an equivalent linear approach. The equivalent linear model was used to compute the free-field response of Adelaide regolith during the 1997 Burra earthquake. The aim of this study is to quantify the amplification at the investigated site. The model computed the ground response of horizontally layered soil deposits subjected to transient and vertically propagating shear waves through a one-dimensional-soil column. Each soil layer was assumed to be homogeneous, visco-elastic, and infinite in the horizontal extent. The results of this study were compared to other studies and forward computation of the geotechnical dynamic parameters of the investigated site. The amplification triggered by the 1997 Burra seismic event was deduced. This study reveals the amplification factor up to 3.6 at the studied site. Â© IJOG - 2017.

AB  - After the catastrophic 1257 caldera-forming eruption, a new chapter of Old Rinjani volcanic activity began with the appearance of Rombongan and Barujari Volcanoes within the caldera. However, no published petrogenetic study focuses mainly on these products. The Rombongan eruption in 1944 and Barujari eruptions in pre-1944, 1966, 1994, 2004, and 2009 produced basaltic andesite pyroclastic materials and lava flows. A total of thirty-one samples were analyzed, including six samples for each period of eruption except from 2004 (only one sample). The samples were used for petrography, whole-rock geochemistry, and trace and rare earth element analyses. The Rombongan and Barujari lavas are composed of calc-alkaline and high K calc-alkaline porphyritic basaltic andesite. The magma shows narrow variation of SiO2 content that implies small changes during its generation. The magma that formed Rombongan and Barujari lavas is island-arc alkaline basalt. Generally, data show that the rocks are enriched in Large Ion Lithophile Elements (LILE: K, Rb, Ba, Sr, and Ba) and depleted in High Field Strength Elements (HFSE: Y, Ti, and Nb) which are typically a suite from a subduction zone. The pattern shows a medium enrichment in Light REE and relatively depleted in Heavy REE. The processes are dominantly controlled by fractional crystallization and magma mixing. All of the Barujari and Rombongan lavas would have been produced by the same source of magma with little variation in composition caused by host rock filter process. New flux of magma would likely have occurred from pre-1944 until 2009 period that indicates slightly decrease and increase of SiO2 content. The Rombongan and Barujari lava generations show an arc magma differentiation trend. Â© IJOG - 2016.

AB  - The Nam Con Son Basin covering an area of circa 110,000 km2 is characterized by complex tectonic settings of the basin which has not fully been understood. Multiple faults allowed favourable migration passageways for hydrocarbons to go in and out of traps. Despite a large amount of newly acquired seismic and well data there is no significant update on the tectonic evolution and history of the basin development. In this study, the vast amount of seismic and well data were integrated and reinterpreted to define the key structural events in the Nam Con Son Basin. The results show that the basin has undergone two extentional phases. The first N - S extensional phase terminated at around 30 M.a. forming E - W trending grabens which are complicated by multiple half grabens filled by Lower Oligocene sediments. These grabens were reactivated during the second NW - SE extension (Middle Miocene), that resulted from the progressive propagation of NE-SW listric fault from the middle part of the grabens to the margins, and the large scale building up of roll-over structure. Further to the SW, the faults of the second extentional phase turn to NNE-SSW and ultimately N - S in the SW edge of the basin. Most of the fault systems were inactive by Upper Miocene except for the N - S fault system which is still active until recent time. Â© IJOG - 2016.

AB  - This paper presents metamorphic evolution of metamorphic rocks from the Meratus Complex in South Kalimantan, Indonesia. Eight varieties of metamorphic rocks samples from this location, which are garnet-bearing epidote-barroisite schist, epidote-barroisite schist, glaucophane-quartz schist, garnet-muscovite schist, actinolite-talc schist, epidote schist, muscovite schist, and serpentinite, were investigated in detail its petrological and mineralogical characteristics by using polarization microscope and electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA). Furthermore, the pressure-temperature path of garnet-bearing epidote-barroisite schist was estimated by using mineral parageneses, reaction textures, and mineral chemistries to assess the metamorphic history. The primary stage of this rock might be represented by the assemblage of glaucophane + epidote + titanite Â± paragonite. The assemblage yields 1.7 - 1.0 GPa in assumed temperature of 300 - 550 Â°C, which is interpreted as maximum pressure limit of prograde stage. The peak P-T condition estimated on the basis of the equilibrium of garnet rim, barroisite, phengite, epidote, and quartz, yields 547 - 690 Â°C and 1.1 - 1.5 GPa on the albite epidote amphibolite-facies that correspond to the depth of 38 - 50 km. The retrograde stage was presented by changing mineral compositions of amphiboles from the Si-rich barroisite to the actinolite, which lies near 0.5 GPa at 350 Â°C. It could be concluded that metamorphic rocks from the Meratus Complex experienced low-temperature and high-pressure conditions (blueschist-facies) prior to the peak metamorphism of the epidote amphibolite-facies. The subduction environments in Meratus Complex during Cretaceous should be responsible for this metamorphic condition.

AB  - The lithofacies association, mainly lithology and depositional sequences of the Brown Shale Unit of Pematang Group was studied based on recent fieldwork at Karbindo Coal Mine, in Kiliran Jao Subbasin,West Sumatra, Indonesia. The lower part of the Brown Shale Unit consists of coal and limestone facies which were deposited in a marginal lacustrine area. The limestone was generated by evaporatic processes characterized by the presence of primary calcite crystals. The upper part of the unit, from bottom to top, is composed of six facies associations, among all: amalgamated massive thick bedded shales, interlaminated shales and siltstones, interbedded grey and red shales, fossiliferous shales, massive thick bedded shales, and interlaminated shale and sandstone facies. Those facies were deposited in a shallow to deep water lacustrine environment, characterized by their lithology compositions, sedimentary structures, and fossil contents. The unit has such as high content of reworked organic matters-bearing shales and mudstones. Turbiditic sedimentary structures, gastropods, and bivalves are common.

AB  - Most of continental Southeast Asia, that is, Sundaland and Indosinia, achieved a relative tectonic stability by the beginning of the Cenozoic. Since then a strong tectonic activity in Sundaland has been restricted to existing regional fault zones and to regional slow, vertical crustal movements elsewhere that produced small to very large sedimentary basins. On the other hand, regional deformation of Indosinia as a consequence of ductile shearing has continued into the Paleogene. Since the Oligocene, the northern part of Sundaland and Indosinia have been extruded differentially towards southeast along the Red River, Wang Chao (or Mae Ping, or Tonle Sap), and Three Pagodas - Axial Malay fault zones. The initial cause has been attributed to hard collision between Subplate India with Megaplate Eurasia. Plate dynamics in the region have changed substantially since Mid-Miocene as to force wrench-slip reversals along the major fault zones in Sundaland as well as in Indosinia. Concomitant structural inversions are demonstrated on seismic sections. In the core of Sundaland, earlier transtensional wrenching was succeeded by transpressive strike-slip faulting that on major faults of the Malay Basin manifested in reversals of sense. From the Hinge-line fault eastward, the transtensional left wrench slip was succeeded by transpressional dextral slip, while in the region to its west the wrench-slip kinematics was an earlier transtensional right slip followed by transpressional left slip. In the Strait of Malacca and eastern margin of Sumatra, right-lateral wrenching in the Neogene has been common. In certain places it could be established a wrench-slip of transtensional character in Oligocene-Early Miocene, and the transpressional wrench movement occurred mainly during the Middle to Late Miocene. The remarkable coincidence of termination of spreading of the South China Basin in Langhian, and that of the West Philippine and Caroline basins during Mid Miocene invites further study.

AB  - New technology is needed to protect the safety and health of communities and the environmentat ASGM locations in Indonesia. This technology must be simple, cheap, easy to operate, and financially rewarding. A proven option that should be promoted is phytoextraction, a farming activity that could develop agriculture as an alternative livelihood in ASGM areas. This isa technology where plants are used to extract metals from waste rock, soil, or water. These metals can be recovered from the plant in its pure form, then be sold or recycled. Gold phytoextrac tion is a commercially available technology, whilean international research has shown that phytoextraction will also work for mercury. In the context of this idea, tailings would be contained in 'farming areas' and cropped using phytoextraction technology. Gold and mercury would be extracted in the crops, with the remaining mercury burden of the tailings becoming adsorbed to soil constituents. The system would be financially rewarding to 'gold farmers'. The economic value of this scenario could facilitate the clean-up and management of mercury pollution, reducing the movement of mercury from tailings into soil, water, and plants, thereby mitigating environmental and human risk in the mining areas. The goal of the described research is to promote agriculture as an alterna tive livelihood in ASGM areas. The gold value of the phytoremediation crop should provide a cash incentive to artisanal farmers who develop this new agricultural enterprise. The benefits will be social, environmental, and economic, as opportunities for education, employment, new business, the containment of toxic mercury, food safety and security, and revenue are all realized.

AB  - Two popular rock strength criteria, the linear Coulomb and non-linear Hoek-Brown, are widely used in underground designs. These two criteria may be applied differently depending on rock conditions. Weak rocks may have different properties compared to hard rocks. Both criteria have been applied in a current research to practically determine the applicability of the criteria in estimating the strength of weak rock masses of five shallow underground structures. Results show that both criteria are able to model the strength of the five weak rock masses, but as expected the criteria provide quite different values for each type of rocks. The strength of rock masses around underground structures depends on uniaxial compressive strength and confinement; but the linear criterion very much depends on shear characteristics of rock materials. Whereas, the non-linear criterion relies on the geological strength index (GSI). Although the GSI may have served practical descriptions for rock masses, some difficulties were found when using the GSI for very weak pyroclastic rocks. The GSI seems to provide underestimated indexes for these rock types. Estimations show that the non-linear criterion may not really exhibit curved strength envelopes rather linear in some sense, for five weak rock masses. Thus in general, when an underground structure is reasonably shallow, has a lack of confinement, and where the shear behaviour dominates rock failures, the linear criterion is more preferable than the non-linear criterion in modelling the strength of weak rock masses.

AB  - Lateral reservoir drainage is a hydrodynamic flow type driven by the difference in overpressure. It can lead to hydrodynamically tilted hydrocarbon water contact, and open an opportunity of finding oil and gas in places where previously are not considered as potential traps. In this paper, some examples of the presence of hydrodynamic traps in Indonesia's sedimentary basin are discussed. Tilted hydrocarbon water contacts are present in some fields in the Lower Kutai Basin, and our interpretation is that regional lateral reservoir drainage is present in this basin and is responsible for the tilted contacts. It is also interpreted that lateral reservoir drainage leading to tilted hydrocarbon water contacts may be present at the Arun Field - North Sumatra Basin, Vorwata Field - Bintuni Basin, and BD Field - offshore East Java Basin. As most Indonesia's sedimentary basins are overpressured, the presence of lateral reservoir drainage driven by overpressure difference in the same stratigraphic unit is very plausible to occur, opening the opportunity for hydrodynamically tilted hydrocarbon water contact to be present.

AB  - This paper introduces the petrographic characteristics and depositional environment of Middle Miocene rocks of the Thien Ung - Mang Cau structure in the central area of Nam Con Son Basin based on the results of analyzing thin sections and structural characteristics of core samples. Middle Miocene sedimentary rocks in the studied area can be divided into three groups: (1) Group of terrigenous rocks comprising greywacke sandstone, arkosic sandstone, lithic-quartz sandstone, greywacke-lithic sandstone, oligomictic siltstone, and bitumenous claystone; (2) Group of carbonate rocks comprising dolomitic limestone and bituminous limestone; (3) Mixed group comprising calcareous sandstone, calcarinate sandstone, arenaceous limestone, calcareous claystone, calcareous silty claystone, dolomitic limestone containing silt, and bitumen. The depositional environment is expressed through petrographic characteristics and structure of the sedimentary rocks in core samples. The greywacke and arkosic sandstones are of medium grain size, poor sorting and roundness, and siliceous cement characterizing the alluvial and estuarine fan environment expressed by massive structure of core samples. The mixed calcareous limestone, arenaceous dolomitic limestone, and calcareous and bituminous clayey siltstone in the core samples are of turbulent flow structure characterizing shallow bay environment with the action of bottom currents. The dolomitic limestones are of relatively homogeneous, of microgranular and fine-granular texture, precipitated in a weakly reducing, semi-closed, and relatively calm bay environment.

AB  - The topic on Landslide Vulnerability Assessment (LVAs) in Malaysia is relatively new and received little attention from geoscientists and engineers. This research paper tries to formulate the concept of LVAs by taking into account the science and socio-economic aspects. A new approach in vulnerability concept is also introduced herein. To achieve this goal, a framework was designed for assessing the LVAs. The framework was formulated semiquantitatively through the development of database for the risk elements (human and properties) based on information from secondary data (technical reports), extensive review of literature, and field observations. The vulnerability parameters included in assessing LVAs are 1) physical implication (building structures, internal materials, property damage, infrastructural facilities, and stabilization actions), 2) social status (injury, fatalities, safety, loss of accommodation, and public awareness), and 3) interference on environment (affected period, daily operation, and diversity). Each considered parameter in the vulnerability assessment is allocated with a certain index value ranges from 0 (0 % damage/victims/period), 0.25 (1 - 25% damage/victims/period), 0.50 (26 - 50% damage/victims/period), 0.75 (51 - 75% damage/victims/period), and 1.00 (75 - 100% damage/victims/period). All of these parameters are compiled and analyzed with "Landslide Distribution Map" (LDM) to generate a "Landslide Vulnerability Degree map (LVD)". The LDM was produced based on field studies and satellite image interpretations in order to locate the landslide locations in the studied area. Finally, three types of physical, human, and environment vulnerabilities were then classified into five classes of vulnerabilities, namely: Class 1 ( < 0.20): Very Low Vulnerability; Class 2 (0.21 - 0.40): Low Vulnerability; Class 3 (0.41 - 0.60): Medium Vulnerability; Class 4 (0.61 - 0.80): High Vulnerability); and Class 5 ( > 0.81): Very High Vulnerability. Results from this study indicate that a further study is needed to the areas of high to very high vulnerability only. This LVAs approach is suitable as a guideline for preliminary development planning, controlling, and managing the landslide hazard /risk in the studied area and potentially to be extended with different background environments.

AB  - Karimun is an island with various geological deposits: tin, granite, sand, and others. The tin deposit in Karimun is related to the granitoid tin belt which extends from Myanmar to western Indonesia. Late Triassic Karimun Granite is composed of quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase, biotite, and/or muscovite with small amounts of accessory minerals. The granitoid unit is different with other felsic intrusive rocks in Malay Peninsular because of its A-type affinity although it is classified as part of the Tin Islands. All eight samples can be classified as altered rocks since the occurrence of secondary chlorite was identifed both macroscopically and microscopically. Petrography was used to describe the minerals that form the samples, whereas XRF and ICP-MS were used to study Karimun Granite from the geochemical point of view. Harker diagrams confirm that the granites show similarity to other granite units in Malaysia except for CaO. Whalen diagrams indicate the granite as A-type as well as the SiO2, REE, and LILE amounts. REE content in the weak peraluminous granitoid ranges from 183 to 3,296 ppm with Eu and Ce show negative anomalies in the REE spider diagram. Negative anomalies of Eu, Ba, Sr, P, and Ti in normalized spider plot also conclude that the studied granitoid indicates A-type.

AB  - The ore mineralogy of the westernmost part of West Java such as Pongkor, Cibaliung, Cikidang, Cikotok, and Cirotan are characterized by the dominance of silver-arsenic-antimony sulfosalt with silver selenides and rarely tellurides over the argentite, whereas the eastern part of West Java including Arinem and Cineam deposits are dominated by silver-gold tellurides. Mineralogy of Se-type deposits at Pongkor, Cikidang, Cibaliung, Cisungsang, and Cirotan and Te-type deposits at Arinem and Cineam shows their different geochemical characteristics. Mineralogical and geochemical differences can be explained by variation of physico-chemical conditions that existed during gold-silver deposition by applying the phase relation among sulfide, telluride, and selenide mineral association in the deposits. The relative values of fSe2(g), fTe(g), and fS2(g) control the actual presence of selenide or telluride minerals within the West Java deposits, which also depend on their concentrations in the hydrothermal fluid. Even though the concentration of selenium in the hydrothermal fluid of Te-type deposits might have been similar or even higher than that in the Se-type, early substitution of selenium in the sulfide minerals prevents its concentration in the hydrothermal fluid to the levels for precipitating selenide minerals. Therefore, early sulfide mineral deposition from reduction fluids will not increase the fSe2(g)/fS2(g) ratio to form selenide minerals in Te-type deposits of Arinem and Cineam, other than selenium-bearing sulfide mineral such as Se-bearing galena or Se-bearing pyrargyrite-proustite.

AB  - Coral reef is one of the best archives of a climate change. The reefs record the condition of environment where they developed. Indonesia as a tropical country has abundant coral reefs from Tertiary to Recent. The ancient reefs are commonly found along the coast and they form terraces. This research is located at the Selayar limestone of Bulukumba Regency, South Sulawesi. The objective of this research is to define paleoclimate change based on the coral development and sea level fluctuation. Sample collection was done by applying five intersect lines perpendicular to the cliff. Petrographic analyses of fossils, and microfacies study as well as the sea level fluctuation were analyzed by studying organism, reef development, and morphology. This article is focused on the sea level fluctuation analysis. There are three stages of the reef development and sea level fluctuation. It was initiated within a protected shallow marine to a reef front slope unconformably overlying siliciclastic rock. The second period of the reef development is characterized by the growing of branching, delicate, robust, and massive corals associating giant Tridacna sp. The third period is the formation of bafflestone delicate branching coral and robust branching corals. Following the Pleistocene reef development three beach abrasions (notches) were identified indicating the sea level fluctuation. Beach abrasions occurred during the Pleistocene reef development as the first notch. The second notch occurred at the reef crest and back reef during the first sea level fall and finally the recent sea level as the third notch. Â© IJOG - 2016.

AB  - This paper focuses on the Quaternary Baturetno Formation. An earlier research concluded that the black clay of the Baturetno Formation formed as a 'palaeolake' deposit. The 'palaeolake' was interpreted to form due to the shifting course of the Bengawan Solo Purba River in relation to Pliocene tectonic tilting in the southern Java. The stratigraphy of the Baturetno Formation was observed in the western part of the Baturetno Basin, and based on marker beds, the Baturetno Formation was classified into three units: (1) Gravel unit (GR) in the upper part, (2) clay unit (CU) in the middle part, and (3) sand-gravel unit (SG) in the lower part. There are floating gravel fragments of andesite, claystone, coral, and limestone with diameters of up to 10 cm in the clay unit. The particle size of sediment reflects the environment, but the lake deposition occurs under very quiet conditions. The occurrence of these fragments within the clay cannot be explained if the clay was deposited within a lake environment. The occurrence of floating fragments in the black clay of Baturetno Formation can best be explained through mudflow process. The cohesive strength of the mudflow is responsible for the ability of large fragments to float within the mud matrix. In general, the Baturetno Formation is inferred to be an alluvial fan deposit. The presence of sand, gravel, and mud are characteristics of alluvial fan deposits.

AB  - This research aims to determine the facies and diagenetic level of limestone of the Upper Cibulakan and Parigi Formations, and also aims to determine the structural correlation between surface and subsurface limestones. Based on thin section analyses taken from the core and outcrop samples, there are four types of lithofacies on the Upper Cibulakan Formation, i.e. mudstone-wackestone, wackestone-packstone, packstone-grainstone, and grainstone facies, and also four types of lithofacies on the Parigi Limestone Formation, i.e. mudstone-wackestone, wackestone-packstone, packstone-grainstone, and lower mudstone-wackestone facies. The analysis of surface and subsurface limestone facies of the Upper Cibulakan and Parigi Formations led to the knowledge of the proportionality and variation of the limestone characteristics on both positions. Limestone of the Upper Cibulakan Formation was deposited locally and discontinuously, whilst the Parigi Formation limestone was deposited evenly and continuously. The structural correlation between the surface and subsurface limestone indicates that these formations were uplifted/exposed due to a local force, likely caused by the intrusion of igneous rocks, as happened in the Kromong Complex. The presence of residual hydrocarbon on the surface of the limestone samples suggests the possibility of potential hydrocarbon trapped in the limestone beneath the surface.

AB  - Batur is one of the finest known calderas on Earth, and is the source of at least two major ignimbrite eruptions with a combined volume of some 84 km3 and 19 km3. These ignimbrites have a similar compositions, raising the question of whether they are geneticaly related. The Batur Ignimbrite-1 (BI-1) is crystal poor, containing rhyodacitic (68 - 70wt % SiO2), white to grey pumices and partly welded and unwelded. The overlying Batur Ignimbrite-2 (BI-2) is a homogeneous grey to black dacitic pumices (64 - 66 wt % SiO2), unwelded and densely welded (40 - 60% vesicularity), crystal and lithic rich. Phase equilibria indicate that the Batur magma equilibrated at temperatures of 1100 - 1300Â°C with melt water contents of 3 - 6 wt%. The post-eruptive Batur magma was cooler ( &lt; 1100Â°C) and it is melt more water rich ( &gt; 6 wt % H2O). A pressure of 20 kbar is infered from mineral barometry for the Batur magma chamber. Magmatic chamber model is one in which crystals and melt separate from a convecting Batur magma by density differences, resulting in a stratified magma chamber with a homogeneous central zone, a crystal-rich accumulation zone near the walls or base, and a buoyant, melt-rich zone near the top. This is consistent with the estimated magma temperatures and densities: the pre-eruptive BI-1 magma was hoter (1300Â°C) and more volatile rich (6 wt % H2O) with density 2.25 g/cm3 than the BI-2 magma (1200Â°C; 4 wt % H2O) in density was higher (2.50 g/cm3). Batur melt characteristics and intensive parameters are consistent with a volatile oversaturation-driven eruption. However, the higher H2O content, high viscosity and low crystal content of the BI-1 magma imply an external eruption trigger.

AB  - In order to determine the sense of fault motion, older textbooks advise to stroke the fault surface parallel to its striations, or slickensides. The smoother touch is felt when one's palm moved in the direction of the adjacent fault surface. Laboratory triaxial tests and abundant field evidence proved this 'smoothness criterion' of producing ambiguous results. The first published field evidence contradicting the criterion probably originated from the Lokulo area in Central Jawa over half a century ago. Similar findings from elsewhere around the world have also been printed. A practical nomenclature has since developed. The types of reliable fault-plane markings in various rock types are now known. Recognition of fault-movement sense is essential when outcrop size is limited such as in underground exploration and in trenches. In addition, the present article also shows examples how the sense of faulting is applied to arrive at determining structural evolution of a rock body. The method is readily applied to solve structural problems of more extensive geological terranes.

AB  - Geomorphological mapping has been done at the upstream part of Progo Drainage Area by measuring some geomorphological indexes and level of shallow groundwater level at 196 stations, to investigate connections between geomorphological characteristics and groundwater system in the area. These indexes are valley floor - height ratio (Vf), valley cross section (Vratio o rVr), stream gradient index (SL), and drainage density (Dd). Based on the linear regression analysis, the four indexes show none to very weak correlation to water table at most locations. It means that all width, height, and width of the river valley do not control shallow groundwater level. However, some locations indicate a strong control of elevation to shallow groundwater level. The first case indicates that there is another controlling factor to the shallow groundwater system. Most likely, a deeper aquifer exists at those locations, which does not show up in the second case. All results give a preliminary indication that morphometry can be used to predict groundwater system in the area. Â© 2018, Geological Agency.

AB  - The North Konawe Regency, located in the northern part of the southeast arm of Sulawesi Province, is occupied mainly by Ophiolite Complex. Recent studies on weathering of ultramafic complex have been focussed on the composition of laterite in relation to heavy metal explorations. In Asera area, North Konawe, a 3.1 m wide outcrop of ultramafic rocks is related to nickel laterite potential. In this study, an elemental change during the weathering process is discussed, including the mobilization of rare earth elements. XRF and ICP-MS from The Centre for Geological Survey of Indonesia are the two important geochemistry instruments used in this study. Si, Mg, and Ca are depleted during weathering, whilst the enriched elements are Fe, Al, Ti, and some heavy metals such as Cr, Mn, and Co. A different mobilization pattern is detected on Ni, because of its relation to Mg. Cs, Rb, and Ba are concentrated in a clayey horizon of upper laterite. The increase of REE concentrations is parallel to both Fe and Mn which rises to the top of laterite. Ce and Eu negative anomaly trends indicate oxidizing condition through the weathering process, although the studied profile, influenced by allochthon material, morphology condition, and geochemistry composition, indicates that the transported rock fragments were originated from ultramafic rock.

AB  - Three fossil-bearing intervals have been recognized in the Pleistocene So'a Basin, with the upper one holding important evidence of hominin fossils. The sequence also contains numerous in situ stone artifacts and fossils of other vertebrate taxa. Therefore, multiple dating techniques are crucial to secure the age of the fossil and artifactbearing layers, especially the one with the hominin remains. This paper deals with the palaeomagnetic dating of the So'a Basin sequence to assist other dating methods that have been applied, and to refine the chronostratigraphy of the area. Palaeomagnetic sampling was conducted in four sections along a west to east transect. Four magnetozones can be recognized, consisting of two reverse and two normal polarity zones. By using the available radiometric ages as a guide and comparing the So'a Basin magnetostratigraphy with the Standard Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS), it became clear that both reverse magnetozones are part of the Matuyama Chron, while the normal magnetozones are the Jaramillo subchron and the Brunhes Chron. These palaeomagnetic dating results support the available radiometric dates and refine the age of the fossil-bearing deposits of the So'a Basin. Â© 2018, Geological Agency.

AB  - Northwest Java Basin is one of the Indonesian basins that has the potential of hydrocarbon reservoir. A petrophysical analysis plays a role in determining the physical properties of reservoir rocks such as shale volume, porosity, and water saturation zones which is to analyze the hydrocarbon zone possibilities (net pay). A qualitative analysis and correlation of rock lithology study were carried out at seven wells, while a quantitative study was performed by calculating the volume of the shale with a linear method, density-neutron porosity, and water saturation using simandoux equation, then zoning the prospect zones was finally done. Based on the calculation and data analysis, Vsh cutoff value obtained is 23%, the porosity is 10.6%, and water saturation is 71%. Then, the zones of hydrocarbon prospects were recovered, that are the PI-08 wells (9.632 ft - 9.662 ft), PI-10 (9.420 ft - 9.468 ft, 9.475 ft - 9.516 ft, 10.155 ft - 10.175 ft), well PI-11 (9.268 ft - 9.288 ft), well PI-11ST (9.268 ft - 9.927 ft), well PI-12 (9.396 ft - 9.461 ft, 10.047 ft - 10.059 ft), and PI-13 wells (9.356 ft - 9.416 ft, 9.980 ft - 10.000 ft).

AB  - Coal seams of lignite- to subbituminous rank of Pliocene-age from the Sajau Formation of the Berau Basin are characterized by the presence of a natural fracture system, including cleats. Often, these opening-mode fractures consist of two orthogonal sets (face and butt cleats), both almost perpendicular to the bedding. This paper describes the distribution of orientation, spacing, and aperture of cleats formed in the seams of the Sajau Formation. All observations and measurements were conducted at macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic scales. The butt cleat mean orientations are NE-SW and NW-SE, whereas the face cleat mean orientations are NNE-SSW and NE-SE, and the cleat dip is at a high angle of 75Â° to the north. The angles between the orientations of these cleat sets are nearly 90Â° that is, they are orthogonal. The spacing of the macroface cleats is between 9.52 and 14.46 cm (averaging 11.61 cm), while the spacing of the butt cleats is between 2.3 and 11.3 cm (averaging 5.35 cm). The mean aperture is 0.54 mm. In contrast, the mean spacing of the mesoface cleats is 3.09 mm, and the aperture measurements of these cleats range from 0.0478 to 0.0741 mm (averaging 0.0549 mm). The results obtained from outcrops and X-ray CT (computed tomography) scan clearly indicate that the NNE-SSW face cleat orientations are strictly parallel to the elongation of the main tectonic structures in the studied area. Their origin may be explained by their relationship with local tectonic stress (the maximum principal stress, Ï1, was horizontal). Partial least square analysis of data collected from cleats and faults in the area indicates that a power law distribution exists between the cleat characteristics (spacing, density, and aperture), and the distance of the faults (R2 = 0.56). Cleat formation in the Sajau Formation was mainly controlled by the mechanical response to tectonic stresses, which generated a unique cleat network in the coal. Based on the SEM photography, it is concluded that the development of microcleats in the Sajau Formation resulted from both endogenic processes and tectonic activities as indicated by the change in the shape of the cleats, from straight line to curved shape and branching (intersection of multiple cleats that form a conical network at the end).

AB  - A suite of oil seep samples collected from the Lariang and Karama Basins, West Sulawesi, Indonesia, have been analyzed using GC and GCMS techniques. Their biomarker compositions have been used to reveal the likely source rock that produces oil. These oil seep samples contain a range in both the concentration of hydrocarbons present and certain level of biodegradation experienced. All sterane m/z 217 data display a familiar pattern of steranes with carbon numbers from 27 to 29 together with pregnane and homo-pregnanes, including rearranged steranes. Triterpane (m/z 191) data show a moderate content of tricyclic terpanes (Tri/C30H), medium to high ratio of norhopane/hopane (C29/C30), and medium to high abundant land plan marker such as resin bicadinanes(Bic/C30H) and oleananes (Ol/ C30H). The presence of high abundant oleananes in these samples has been interpreted as the evidence for a marine influence during early diagenesis that may occur by marine or via re-deposition of peat organics in marine sediments. Hence, these results state that the organic matter facies for their source rock oil seep samples from the West Sulawesi region are detected as mixed between allochthonous macerals from typical terrestrial higher plants transported into the basin from distal swamps and soils and some marine organic matter.

AB  - This study aims to locate new groundwater recharge sites in the arid region of northern Badia, Jordan, based on specific criteria including lithology, drainage and lineament density, soil texture, slope, and rainfall. With groundwater serving as the key source of Jordanian drinking water, the use of surface water for groundwater recharge is essential in maximizing the groundwater available. Groundwater recharge sites were selected using the weighted linear combination (WLC) method with the aforementioned criteria. According to the findings, 5.064% of the region is very highly suited to groundwater recharge, 33.599% of the region is highly suited, and 3.789% of the region is moderately suited. However, 26.634% of the region is poorly suited to groundwater recharge, with a further 30.943% being very poorly suited. The significance of each criterion for groundwater recharge was identified using removal analysis, with the most significant factor being efficient groundwater management. Given this finding, big data are required in order to determine the optimal locations for groundwater recharge as part of future groundwater planning and management. Â© 2018, Geological Agency.

AB  - Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) was employed to conduct a geoelectrical survey near the Al-Badia lava tunnel located close to the Al-Bishyrria Village in Jordan. The technique enabled the mapping of the subsurface tunnel extension and description of its inner structure. To assess the quality of data and resistivity models, Schlumberger and Reciprocal Schlumberger electrode configurations were used to produce eight ERT profiles. As revealed by the examination of received potential, the implemented configurations exhibited a strong signal, producing an approximated reciprocal error of up to 6%. The findings of ERT models showed that the lava tunnel had a clearly outlined structure with an elliptical to rectangular shape. The modelled resistivity of the lava tunnel was obtained in proximity to 1000 Î©-m, with a better characterization being possible at resistivity exceeding 8000 Î©-m in 200 Î©-m of Fahda Vesicular Basalt medium. An exploration depth of 50 m revealed that the lava tunnel was 10 m deep and 5 m in diameter on the average. Furthermore, potential means of groundwater recharging were reported by the simultaneous detection of a number of resistivity anomalies of less than 50 Î©-m and lava tunnel. In addition, the lava tunnel was observed to extend and ramify beyond the area under investigation, indicating at the potential existence of multiple lava tunnel extensions in both the investigation area and in the basaltic flows, which could have adverse implications for future urben projects.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to determine the stability of slopes and to propose preliminary rock cut slope protection and stabilization measures for Paleocene to Middle Eocene Trusmadi Formation along Marakau-Kigiok in Ranau, Sabah, Malaysia. The rock of Trusmadi Formation is slightly metamorphosed and dominated by interbeds of sandstone with quartz vein (metagreywacke), metamudstone, shale, slate, sheared sandstone, and mudstone. The rock unit can be divided into four geotechnical units namely arenaceous unit, argillaceous unit, interbedded unit, and sheared unit. Twelve slopes were selected for this study. Geological mapping, discontinuity survey, kinematic analysis, and prescriptive measure were used in this study. Results of this study conclude that the potential modes of failures are planar and wedge. Terrace, surface drainage, weep holes, horizontal drain, vegetation cover, wire mesh, slope reprofiling, and retaining structure were proposed protection and stabilization measures for the slopes in the studied area.

AB  - The seismic activity of Raung Volcano was raised on 11 November 2014. As many as 1709 tremors were recorded followed by continuous tremors appearing in late November 2014. Quasi-harmonic and gliding tremors appeared in a spectrogram on 12 November 2014. The quasi-harmonic tremors refer to tremors that have no fully harmonic form in spectrum. The gliding harmonic tremors refer to harmonic tremors that have frequency jumps with either positive or negative increment. After signal restitution processing, the Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis (MESA) method was applied in Raung recordings resulting the spectrum and the spectrogram of tremors. The quasi-harmonic tremors have the monotonic spectrum in its head and centre segment, and the harmonic one in its tails. There are twenty-four spectrums that show frequency changes between the monotonic and harmonic. The similarity between the fundamental frequency range of the monotonic and harmonic ones suggests that both signals are excited from a common resonator. The alternating of monotonic and harmonic respectively over this period is qualitatively similar with Julian's synthetic time series about the nonlinear oscillator model. It is suggested that Raung Volcano magma pressure is sizeable to make a chaotic vibration. A pressure increasing in Raung magmatic conduit causes the increasing of P-wave velocity and makes a positive gliding frequency. Â© IJOG - 2018.

AB  - This study aims to understand the petrography and chemistry of both magmatic and hydrothermal biotites in porphyry copper-gold deposits, and to evaluate the fluid compositional changes during alteration processes. A total of 206 biotite grains from selected rock samples taken from the Batu Hijau porphyry Cu-Au deposit was analyzed. Detailed petrography and biotite chemistry analysis were performed on thin sections and polished thin sections, respectively, representing various rocks and alteration types. A JEOL JXA-8900R electron microprobe analyzer (EMPA) was used for the chemistry analysis. The biotite is texturally divided into magmatic and hydrothermal types. Ti, Fe, and F contents can be used to distinguish the two biotite types chemically. Some oxide and halogen contents of biotite from various rocks and alteration types demonstrate a systematic variation in chemical composition. Biotite halogen chemistry shows a systematic increase in log (XCl/XOH) and decrease in log (XF/XOH) values from biotite (potassic) through chlorite-sericite (intermediate argillic) to actinolite (inner propylitic) zones. The y-intercepts on the log (XCl/XOH) vs. XMg and log (XF/XOH) vs. XFe plotted for biotite from potassic and intermediate argillic zones are similar or slightly different. In contrast, the y-intercepts on the log (XCl/XOH) vs. XMg and log (XF/XOH) vs. XFe plotted for biotite from inner propylitic zone display different values in comparison to the two alteration zones. Halogen (F,Cl) fugacity ratios in biotite show a similar pattern: in the potassic and intermediate argillic zones they show little variation, whereas in the inner propylitic zone they are distinctly different. These features suggest the hydrothermal fluid composition remained fairly constant in the inner part of the deposit during the potassic and intermediate argillic alteration events, but changed significantly towards the outer part affected by inner propylitic alteration. High halogen content, particularly Cl, in hydrothermal biotite may portray that copper and gold were transported in mineralizing fluids in the form of chloride complexes CuCl2 - and AuCl2 -, respectively.

AB  - An excavation of a vertebrate fossil site was carried out in 2012 in the Seropan Cave of Gunung Sewu karst area, Wonosari, Yogyakarta. Among the discovered mammal fossils there are Cervus sp., Sus verrucosus, Bubalus sp., and Panthera cf. pardus. Small mammal bone fragments of GSP (Gua Seropan/Seropan Cave) Nos. 38, 67, 91-113 have been analyzed for C14 radiocarbon age dating, which gave a date of 9,450 Â± 400 yrs. B.P. or Early Holocene. The Seropan fauna is part of the succession series of Braholo fauna that migrated before the Late Pleistocene, and was isolated after the last Ice Age. The Seropan fauna developed and adapted their morphology to the local habitat. Â© IJOG - 2018.

AB  - Seven periods of GPS campaign have been conducted for three years since March 2013 - October 2015 on fourteen GPS sites across Bali Island. The GAMIT/GLOBK 10.6 version was used to compute data with respect for thirteen reference sites of International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) 2008 surrounding Bali. The result shows that horizontal displacement varies between 1.93 and 22.53 mm/yr dominantly northeastward. Vertical displacement ranges at -184.34 to 33.79 mm/yr. The result of modeling using Coulomb 3.3 version indicates the deformation in Bali was mostly contributed by subduction at the southern part, West and East Flores Back-Arc Thrust at the north, Lombok Strait Fault and a fault at the eastern coast of Bali with the estimation maximum magnitude of 7.1, 6.6, 6.8, 5.8, and 5.2, respectively.

AB  - This study applies the charcoalification measurement method to infer the emplacement temperature of pyroclastic flow deposits erupted from the Sundoro Volcano, Indonesia. This pyroclastic flow partially covered the Liyangan archeological site, a site where Hindu temples were constructed approximately 1,000 years ago. Five samples of charcoal collected from this area were analyzed for reflectance and elemental composition. Charcoalification temperatures were determined based on mean random optical reflectance values (Ro) plotted on published Ro-Temperature curves. Charcoalification temperatures were also estimated using a published formula based on the charcoal's hydrogen to carbon (H/C) ratio. These two methods for determining pyroclastic flow deposition temperatures indicated that the pyroclastic deposits that entombed the Liyangan archeological site ranged from 295Â° to 487Â°C when they were deposited. This study used very simple, rapid, precise, and low-cost methods of charcoalification temperature measurement to infer the emplacement temperature of a pyroclastic deposit. This estimation procedure could be applied widely to predict emplacement temperatures in volcanic area in Indonesia to enhance volcanic hazard mitigation. Â© IJOG - 2018.

AB  - Several outcrops were studied to identify sedimentary facies and to analyze permeability distribution, through which an outcrop analogue for upper shoreface reservoirs can be established. Four facies were identified: upper shoreface, lower shoreface, offshore transition, and tidal ones. Stratigraphic correlation of eleven outcrops indicates that the upper shoreface sandstone is generally clean, well sorted, parallel, and planar cross laminated. The sand becomes thinner and pinches out to the northwest where the mud proportion increases within the sand. Muddier sand was deposited in a relatively low energy upper shoreface setting. The thickness of the upper shoreface reservoir sand generally is 5 m. It decreases to zero over approximately 1.3 km as the sand pinches out to the northwest. To the northeast, the thickness also decreases to 4 m over approximately 4 km. Permeability values are more variable laterally than vertically. The permeability distribution has an obvious relationship to the sedimentary facies and is mainly controlled by the proportion of mud and bioturbation. As the sand pinches out in the northwest, permeability decreases from 590 md to 97 md over 1 km. To the northeast, permeability also decreases to 152 md over approximately 4 km where the sand becomes highly bioturbated. These values indicate that the sands are of good to very good reservoir quality. It appears that there are no major barriers to the lateral flow of fluid within the upper shoreface sandstone.

AB  - A detailed geological mapping and fracture characterization had been performed in Bantimala area, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The geology of the studied area is composed of pre-Tertiary metamorphic, sedimentary, and igneous rocks which tectonically mixed forming a mÃ©lange complex. Located on the southeastern margin of Sundaland, the tectonic strongly influences the fracture occurrences in the studied area. A total of 3,841 fractures comprising shear fractures, extension fractures, veins, and joints have been measured and analyzed. The common fracture orientations are NW - SE, W - E, NNE - SSW, and ENE - WSW trends. Fractures developing in Bantimala have clearly been controlled by lithology and structure position (i.e. fault zones and fold hinge). The orientation of fractures in Bantimala area is different on each lithology, showing that the fracture system was complex. Fracture intensity in schist is higher compared to the other lithologies. The 3D fracture modeling through 3D geocellular modeling was generated using the result from field data measurements and analyses. Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) was built by fifty-one fracture sets that were analyzed from field measurement data. However, the estimation of average fracture porosity from modeling varies significantly depending on lithology. The value of fracture porosity is relatively small, varied from 0.0004 to 0.0029 %. A high fracture porosity number is observed in an area with a significant fracture intensity and most crosscutting of fracture which in turn is controlled by faults and lithology. A mÃ©lange complex can have high potential as a basement fractured reservoir target, where fracture distributions and their attributes will vary depending on the lithology as well as local deformation.

AB  - A groundwater study has been conducted in the Semarang City in August 2014, aiming to determine the source of shallow groundwater salinization using stable isotopes (18O, 2H) and water chemistry approach, and supported by local hydrogeological data. A number of shallow groundwater samples were taken at several locations with a depth of 0 - 35 m. Based on geological data, shallow groundwater of Semarang alluvium is dominated by insertion of sand-gravel and sandy-clay with average porosity of around 56.0 %. This layer is thinning towards the south and then increasingly thickening to the north and north-east of the studied area. The results of the analyses show that the characteristics of shallow groundwater, i.e. approximately 51% of groundwater, still have the original composition as meteoric water and the remaining approximately 49% obtained a shift in the isotopic composition as caused by interaction with seawater and the little influence of evaporation. The results of chemical analysis of water indicates that in dry seasons, shallow groundwater aquifers in the Semarang City is dominated by chloride (Cl-) with NaCl of water type. While the parameters of bicarbonate, chloride, and Na/Cl ratio, shallow groundwater can be classified into two groups, namely unintruded groundwater around 51% spread from the foot hills to the south towards the hills with elevations of 9 - 142 m above sea level and intruded groundwater around 49% spread from the coastline to the urban direction.

AB  - The shortage of clean water occurs almost everywhere around the world. The demand for water supply increases from time to time due to various problems such as development, population growth, pollution, global warming, agricultural activities, logging, and so on. This study was conducted in the vicinity of Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, by using the Geographic Information System (GIS) for mapping the groundwater potential zones. The main objective of this study was to generate the predictive map of groundwater potential zones in the studied area through the integration of various thematic maps by using the GIS. This study includes five stages, namely collection and preparation of basic data, data analyses, development of space database, spatial analyses, and space integration. There are eleven parameters used in this study, namely rainfall, drainage, soil type, landuse, lithology, lineament density, topography, slope steepness, the ratio of sand and clay, major fault zones, and syncline zones. By using the Heuristic method, the final map of groundwater potential zones in the studied area is divided into five classes, which are very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. Â© IJOG - 2017.

AB  - This paper analyzed the mineral maps of AlOH bearing minerals and iron oxide using ASTER imagery in Tick Hill, Mount Isa, northwestern part of Queensland, as a guide for mapping the regolith unit within the area. Tick Hill is part of the Proterozoic Eastern and Western Fold Belt Province (Mount Isa Inlier Complex) covered by Mesozoic and Paleozoic lithologies and dominated by medium to coarse hornblende-biotite granite and gneiss; both of which intruded during 1760 - 1720 Ma. Highly weathered landforms cover the whole area. The Mesozoic sediments have experienced deep weathering, and currently present in the form of mesas. The weathering profiles are dominated by kaolinite, smectite, and pedogenic carbonates with some secondary silicification. Part of the landform is covered by colluvium varying in thickness from less than 1 m up to 12 m in certain places. Digital image processing has been done to ASTER imagery, i.e: calibrating, mosaicing, and band ratioing and false colour RGB. Within these methods, iron oxide, kaolinite, AlOH, and MgOH group mineral maps have successfully been created through the ASTER imagery. Later, these mineral maps were applied to interpret the surface regolith mapping unit. In addition, field samples have been taken in regolith covered areas to validate the ASTER mineral information.

AB  - A shear-wave splitting analysis was determined to observe anisotropic structures of an upper mantle layer beneath Sumatra. The data were collected from 35 BMKG stations with the magnitude of more than 6.25 Mw and the epicentre of 85Â° - 140Â°. A shear-wave splitting measurement was calculated by using Splitlab based on three methods simultaneously. The result of the shear-wave splitting measurement in the Sumatra Forearc and Fault Zone shows that there are two anisotropic layers. The first layer has a dominant-fast-polarization direction that is parallel with a trench, and has the delay time duration of 0.5 - 0.9 s-. It is presumed that it is caused by a shear-strain as a result of the existences of Mentawai and Sumatra Fault Zones. The second layer has a dominant-fast-polarization direction that is perpendicular to the trench with the delay time duration of about 1.1 - 1.9 s-. It is presumed that it is caused by a movement of a subduction plate on a mantle wedge. The measurement in the backarc shows that there is only one anisotropic layer that is a subduction plate. It is also found that there is a transition of an orientation change on the subduction plate between Sumatra and Java. The change of the polarization direction is probably related to the age difference and the direction velocity of the absolute plate movement (APM) from Sumatra to Java. Â© IJOG - 2017.

AB  - Nanggulan Formation consists of the oldest clastic rock sequence exposed in Kulonprogo area, Yogyakarta. This paper discusses the position of Nanggulan Formation as a basement. The method used in this research is surface and subsurface investigations based on gravity surveys. The rock assemblage is exposed and distributed partly in the east flank of Kulonprogo Mountains with weak undulated morphology. The rock sequence is composed of sand to clay grain sizes such as sandstone, quartz sandstone, calcareous sandstone, claystone, fossiliferous claystone, calcareous claystone, siltstone, and coal seam intercalations. The total thickness of the sequence is less than 200 m. Based on the fossil and palynology investigations, previous investigators concluded the age of the rock was Eocene to Middle Miocene. The geological structures developed in the rocks are the lithological stratification, fractures, folding, and faulting. The subsurface interpretation based on gravity data revealed the rock was located under the andesite breccias with 2.44 g/cc density. The density of the rock sequence was 2.63 g/cc. The gravity interpretation shows a strong indication that Nanggulan Formation underlies the andesitic breccias presumably associated with Old Andesite Formation exposed in Kulonprogo Mountains. The limited distribution, the thickness, and the closed environmental deposition of Nanggulan Formation found in the present investigation raised problems on the position of the formation as the basement of Old Andesite Formation occurring in the Kulonprogo Mountain.

AB  - A topic of seismic hazard analysis (SHA) is briefly elaborated. A probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) is commonly used to assess the ground motion level expected with different likelihood at a rock site during a future seismic event. The Incorporating Monte Carlo method into PSHA in an intraplate region (i.e. Adelaide region) is an interesting topic to explore. The result of the analysis using this method is able to characterize the likelihood of seismicity in a targeted region. Furthermore, the results clearly display the seismic ground motions in term of peak ground acceleration and peak ground velocity in Adelaide region. The de-aggregation of the analysis suggests two expected severe events for the Adelaide City. The first expected event is an earthquake M5.2 from a distance of 15 km and 25 km from the city. The second expected one corresponds to an earthquake M6.6 occurring 85 km away from the Adelaide City. However, the results of this analysis must be treated carefully due to dubious seismic data catalogue for a relatively large seismic event in Adelaide region. Â© IJOG - 2017.

AB  - The Sagori Atoll of the Kabaena Island, SE Sulawesi is one of Indonesia's remote tropical reefs and such has received little attention from reef researchers. Non of early scientific expeditions reported either geomorphology or ecology of the Sagori Atoll in detail. This study is the first investigation of the reef geomorphology and associated habitats of Sagori Atoll within a biodiversity of "Coral reef Triangle Initiative - CTI" region, using data from satellite imagery and on ground observation. The Sagori Atoll environment consists of reef-island, atoll rim, and lagoon in which six habitats are associated, including: sand cay, coralgal pavement, sand sheet (intertidal and subtidal), sand-hardground striation, and outer atoll rim and lagoon (shallow and deep). The reef-island is built from sediments that are entirely calcareous, resting on a platform of lithified coral conglomerate. The atoll rim is dominated by coralgal pavement consisting mainly of both encrusting and living coralline algae. The lagoon which is a semi-enclosed pool and opens to the eastern side, consists of sand and scattered corals. The atoll formation is considered to be of nonvolcanic origin, but is rising from the depth of due to anticlinal island subsidence. Â© IJOG - 2017.

AB  - Three seepage gas samples collected from Boto Area, Bancak, Semarang, Central Java, were studied to determine their chemical characteristics using GC and GC-IRMS methods. They are composed 53 - 85% of methane predominantly. However, gas seep Site 3 sample has the highest N2 compound and the lesser extent to the samples Site 2 and Site 1 respectively. The two hydrocarbon gas seeps (Site 1, 2, and Site 3 samples) that are characterized by d13C methane of -35.61â° and -27.97â°, and values of dD methane of -112â° and -109â° respectively, are each isotopically distinct from all others suggesting, at least, they are derived from different maturity level. The Site 3 gas sample is suggested to be more mature than the others. Â© IJOG - 2017.

AB  - The study discusses about characteristics of Sumatra Fault and its tectonic activity in Liwa and the adjacent area. The research uses quantitative methods of verification hypothetical deduction, which starts from the general approach, then it pursues into more specialized and focused ones. While the research work includes field measurements, remote sensing with GIS, and geomorphologic analysis using morphometry, such as: sinousity of mountain front (Smf), percentage of facets, ratio of the width and height of the valley (Vf), bifurcation ratios of the river (Rb), drainage density (Dd), shape of the watershed basin area (Bs), hypsometric curves (HI), and gradient index of stream length (SL). Basically, two blocks separated by the Sumatra Fault do not have a significant difference in tectonic activity, but the tectonic activity change can be seen when the studied area is divided into three blocks (northwest, middle, and southeast), then the change in each part can clearly be seen. Apparently, the tectonic activity in the studied area starts from the southeast continues toward the northwest. It is proved by this research, that geomorphological parameters which are associated with mountain fronts and watershed systems demonstrate the value of the activity increases towards the northwest. Hypsometric curves and a river analysis show that the tectonic activity in the northwest is relatively in a young stage, while towards the southeast it is getting in a mature stage. Â© IJOG - 2017.

AB  - A previous research on black clay of the Baturetno Formation identified that this clay was a palaeolake deposit. In this study, the black clay deposit was characterized by using sedimentological and micropaleontological approaches to reveal its origin. The black clay of the Baturetno Formation has a low organic matter (mostly less than 8%) and almost no pollen content. These characteristics are not representative of a lake deposit. This black clay was suggested a mud flow deposit. This conclusion is supported by the occurrence of dispersed rock fragments in the clay deposit. In addition, the previous research has identified that the formation of a palaeolake was related to the Late Pliocene tilting in South Java. The carbon dating indicates that the deposition of this clay has no relationship to the Late Pliocene tilting in South Java as the age of this clay was determined to be much younger (around 7000 BP; early Holocene).

AB  - Geochemical analyses of selected coastal and seafloor samples from Sabang Area revealed abundances of trace and rare earth elements. The selected samples of element abundances were mostly taken from seafloor in the vicinities of active fumaroles either by grab sampler operated from survey boat above fumarole point or by diver directly took the samples on the seafloor especially at Serui - Sabang Bay. Results show that samples closed to seafloor fumaroles demonstrate plenty of trace and rare earth elements. The trace and rare earth elements mean values (n=10) are: Nb (4.33 ppm), La (16.52 ppm), Ce (38.82 ppm), Nd (19.15 ppm), Ce (38.82 ppm), Pr (4.907 ppm), Nd (19.15 ppm), Sm (4.04 ppm), Gd (3.95 ppm), Dy (3.38 ppm), Th (6.432 ppm), and U (4.335 ppm). Negatively, statistical correlations between Fe, Zn, and Ni as the main sulphide elements with sulphur is interpreted that sulphide minerals do not form in the Sabang Sea. Sea water influence in the mineralization process was shown by the good correlations between Fe, Zn, Pb, Ni, and Ba. Â© IJOG - 2016.

AB  - The Adang Volcanics represent a series of (ultra) potassic to sodic lavas and tuffaceous rocks of predominantly trachytic composition, which forms the part of a sequence of Late Cenozoic high-K volcanic and associated intrusive rocks occurring extensively throughout Western Sulawesi. The tectonic setting and origin of these high-K rocks have been the subject of considerable debates. The Adang Volcanics have mafic to mafitic-intermediate characteristics (SiO2: 46 - 56 wt%) and a wide range of high alkaline contents (K2O: 0.80 - 9.08 %; Na2O: 0.90 - 7.21 %) with the Total Alkali of 6.67 - 12.60 %. Al2O3 values are relatively low (10.63 - 13.21 %) and TiO2 values relatively high (1.27 - 1.91 %). Zr and REE concentrations are also relatively high (Zr: 1154 - 2340 ppm; Total REE (TREY = TRE): 899.20 - 1256.50 ppm; TRExOy: 1079.76 - 1507.97 ppm), with an average Zr/TRE ratio of ~ 1.39. The major rock forming minerals are leucite/pseudoleucite, diopside/aegirine, and high temperature phlogopite. Geochemical plots (major oxides and trace elements) using various diagrams suggest the Adang Volcanics formed in a postsubduction, within-plate continental extension/initial rift tectonic setting. It is further suggested magma was generated by minor ( &lt; 0.1 %) partial melting of depleted MORB mantle material (garnet-lherzolite) with the silicate melt having undergone strong metasomatism. Melt enrichment is reflected in the alkaline nature of the rocks and geochemical signatures such as Nb/Zr &gt; 0.0627 and (Hf/Sm)PM &gt; 1.23. A comparison with the Vulsini ultrapotassic volcanics from the Roman Province in Italy shows both similarities (spidergram pattern indicating affinity with Group III ultrapotassics volcanics) and differences (nature of mantle metasomatism).

AB  - Bayat Complex is usually used as a work field for students of geology and other geosciences. The study area is located in the southern part of the Bayat Complex. Administratively, it belongs to Central Java Province and Yogyakarta Special Province. The lithology of Bayat is very complex, composed of various kinds of igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic, and volcanic rocks. Most of previous researchers interpreted Bayat as a melange complex constructed within a subduction zone. Kebo-Butak is one of formations that forms the Bayat field complex. The formation is composed of basalt, layers of pumice, tuff, shale, and carbonaceous tuff. Most of them are known as volcanic rocks. These imply that volcanic activities are more probable to construct the geology of Bayat rather than the subducted melange complex. The geological mapping, supported by geomorphology, petrology, stratigraphy, and geological structures, had been conducted in a comprehensive manner using the deduction-induction method. The research encounters basalt, black pumice, tuff with basaltic glasses fragments, zeolite, argilic clay, as well as feldspathic- and pumice tuff. Petrographically, the basalt is composed of labradorite, olivine, clinopyroxene, and volcanic glass. Black pumice and tuff contain prismatic clinopyroxene, granular olivine, and volcanic glasses. Feldspathic tuff and pumice tuff are crystal vitric tuff due to more abundant feldspar, quartz, and amphibole than volcanic glass. Zeolite comprises chlorite and altered glasses as deep sea altered volcanic rocks. The geologic structure is very complex, the major structures are normal faults with pyrite in it. There were two deep submarine paleovolcanoes namely Tegalrejo and Baturagung. The first paleovolcano erupted effusively producing basaltic sequence, while the second one erupted explosively ejecting feldspathic-rich pyroclastic material. The two paleovolcanoes erupted simultaneously and repeatedly. Â© IJOG - 2016.

AB  - Hydrographic situation on surface waters is more challenging to be understood, related to global and regional climate change in tropical regions. In addition, records from these tropical areas are limited compared to other areas of subtropical and polar regions. The aim of this study is to reconstruct Cenozoic paleoceanography, in particular nutrient level, using outcrop samples from Kali Pasir, Banyumas, Indonesia. This study is focused on the relationships of the relative abundance of Discoaster, coccolith size of Reticulofenestra, and lithofacies characteristics. Nutrient level is reconstructed using quantitative analysis of calcareous nannofossil by counting calcareous nannofossils on 400 fields of View (FOV) for each sample. The abundance of Discoaster and the large Reticulofenestra represent a deep thermocline and nutricline, which is a typical of oligotrophic condition. This condition also associated with the muddy facies in the early stages of Late Miocene (NN8-NN10a). Conversely, decreasing Discoaster abundance and the abundance of small Reticulofenestra indicate a shallow thermocline and nutricline, resulting strong eutrophication of surface waters in the later stage of Late Miocene (NN10b-NN11). A high nutrient content in this stage is related to classical turbidite deposits. A change in a sea surface resulted in strong eutrophication, which is in this section similar to the eastern Indian Ocean micropaleontology records during the Late Miocene (NN10). This finding shows that strong eutrophication in Kali Pasir section is probably driven by nutrient-rich terrestrial material related to the onset of Indian monsoon during the Late Miocene.

AB  - Stratified sampling of coal beds for petrographic analysis using block samples is a viable alternative to standard methods of channel sampling and particulate pellet mounts. Although petrographic analysis of particulate pellets is employed widely, it is both time consuming and does not allow variation within sampling units to be assessed - an important measure in any study whether it be for paleoenvironmental reconstruction or in obtaining estimates of industrial attributes. Also, samples taken as intact blocks provide additional information, such as texture and botanical affinity that cannot be gained using particulate pellets. Analysis of variance tests (ANOVA) on stratified samples from an Eocene coal bed in Kalimantan, Indonesia showed that the largest amount of microscopic variation occurs between coal types indicating they are petrographically dissimilar. The ANOVA tests also indicated that only a maximum of 125 point counts are needed to make precise estimates of block composition. Confidence limits of estimates from stratified sampling were calculated to be comparable to what would have been obtained using standard crushed particulate pellets. This means less work is needed for the same accuracy of estimates using a stratified sampling method over that of crushed particulate pellets for coal beds. Macroscopic point counting of vitrain bands can accurately account for those particles > 1 mm within a coal interval. This point counting method is conducted using something as simple as string on a coal face with marked intervals greater than the largest particle expected to be encountered (although new technologies are being developed to capture this type of information digitally). Comparative analyses of particulate pellets and blocks on the same interval show less than 6% variation between the two sample types when blocks are recalculated to include macroscopic counts of vitrain. Therefore even in coarse-grained coals, stratified sampling can be used effectively and representatively. Â© IJOG - 2016.

N1  - Funding textÂ 1:Â This paper is 'late' in more than one sense of the word (it is with sadness that I point out the string of 'lates' below, all of whom were not 'late' when the original research was conducted). A statistical treatment of stratified sampling was a significant part of my thesis, which I regretfully was unable to publish-until now. Recent discussions with colleagues, however, have reiterated that this work still has relevance and provides a platform for additional studies. I'd like to acknowledge the invaluable assistance of P.T. Arutmin Indonesia and BHP Minerals International Inc. (now BHP Billiton) for providing the original financial and field support. Mike Friederich, the late Ted Milligan, the late Al Johnnet, Sony Pangestu, Lim Me Sze Wu and Joan S. Esterle are especially thanked. For the New Zealand sample sites, funds were provided by the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology (New Zealand) and the Ministry of Commerce (both are now part of the Ministry for Business, Science and Innovation). Early discussions with G.A. Weisenfluh and J.C. Hower at the University of Kentucky resulted in many insights about types of sampling for use in coal analyses. Jane Shearer is thanked for her field assistance, input and work on an earlier version of this manuscript. The late John C. Ferm is acknowledged for our many discussions on geology, coal, and statistics and the late Ron Stanton for embedding in me the importance of representative sampling. The paper was further improved from reviews by Drs Nana Suwarna and Kaydy Pinetown. Finally, thanks to Cipher Consulting Ltd. for allowing time and resources to be directed into the writing of this paper and Aretha Christie and Micah A. S. Moore for logistical support.

AB  - Most of the Cenozoic tectonic evolution in New Guinea is a result of obliquely convergent motion that led to an arc-continent collision between the Australian and Pacific Plates. The Gunung Bijih (Ertsberg) Mining District (GBMD) is located in the Central Range of Papua, in the western half of the island of New Guinea. This study presents the results of detailed structural mapping concentrated on analyzing fault-slip data along a 15-km traverse of the Heavy Equipment Access Trail (HEAT) and the Grasberg mine access road, providing new information concerning the deformation in the GBMD and the Cenozoic structural evolution of the Central Range. Structural analysis indicates that two distinct stages of deformation have occurred since ~12 Ma. The first stage generated a series of en-echelon NW-trending (Ï-fold axis = 300Â°) folds and a few reverse faults. The second stage resulted in a significant left-lateral strike-slip faulting sub-parallel to the regional strike of upturned bedding. Kinematic analysis reveals that the areas between the major strike-slip faults form structural domains that are remarkably uniform in character. The change in deformation styles from contractional to a strike-slip offset is explained as a result from a change in the relative plate motion between the Pacific and Australian Plates at ~4 Ma. From ~4 - 2 Ma, transform motion along an ~ 270Â° trend caused a left-lateral strike-slip offset, and reactivated portions of pre-existing reverse faults. This action had a profound effect on magma emplacement and hydrothermal activity. Â© IJOG - 2016.

AB  - Indonesia is an interesting and important location for a climate study, because it is located in the centre of a warm pool and adjacent to Pacific and Indian Oceans. Long records of climate data are required from this region to more understand the climate variability and the response of global warming. Geochemical proxies derived from Porites corals are believed to be an excellent climate recorder. Sr/Ca content in Porites corals from Kendari, Southeast Sulawesi shows that seasonal variability of SST is resolved by coral Sr/Ca from this region. The monsoon strongly influences reconstructed SST from coral Sr/Ca. Coral SST shows strong power spectrum at the 2.75 year period. Annual to interannual coral SST signal is stronger than the decadal to interdecadal signal. Both ENSO and IOD influence coral SST at two-month and three-month lags respectively.

AB  - Strong mineralized carbonate rock-bearing Pb-Zn-Cu-Ag-(Au) ores are well exposed on the Latong River area, Madina Regency, North Sumatra Province. The ore deposit is hosted within the carbonate rocks of the Permian to Carboniferous Tapanuli Group. It is mainly accumulated in hollows replacing limestone in the forms of lensoidal, colloform, veins, veinlets, cavity filling, breccia, and dissemination. The ores dominantly consist of galena (126 000 ppm Pb) and sphalerite (2347 ppm Zn). The other minerals are silver, azurite, covellite, pyrite, marcasite, and chalcopyrite. This deposit was formed by at least three phases of mineralization, i.e. pyrite and then galena replaced pyrite, sphalerite replaced galena, and pyrite. The last phase is the deposition of chalcopyrite that replaced sphalerite. The Latong sulfide ore deposits posses Pb isotope ratio of 206Pb/204Pb = 19.16 - 20.72, 207Pb/204Pb = 16.16 - 17.29, and 208Pb/204Pb = 42.92 - 40.78. The characteristic feature of the deposit indicates that it is formed by a sedimentary process rather than an igneous activity in origin. This leads to an interpretation that the Latong deposit belongs to the Sedimentary Hosted Massive Sulfide (SHMS) of Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT). The presence of SHMS in the island arc such as Sumatra has become controversial. For a long time, ore deposits in the Indonesian Island Arc are always identical with the porphyry and hydrothermal processes related to arc magmatism. This paper is dealing with the geology of Latong and its base metal deposits. This work is also to interpret their genesis as well as general relationship to the regional geology and tectonic setting of Sumatra.

AB  - In the context of the study, a Multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) in GIS was used in developing suitability index to optimize suitable lands for agricultural uses and seasonal farming in dry lands from geologic point of view. This study was performed in the areas between Mafraq and Zarqa Cities in Jordan which are classified as arid lands. The study aims at protecting groundwater from pollution, reducing soil salting, reducing irrigation water loss caused by evaporation, and increasing crop productivity. The geo-environmental parameters of the named area including geology, groundwater depths, soil depths and textures, climatic conditions, topographic settings, and groundwater vulnerability conditions were mapped and converted into layers with special rates, given weights, and then modeled using the multi criteria evaluation (MCE) option, using Decision Making Modeling in IDRISI (GIS software) to reach at the best choice of lands for agricultural activities, and also to determine which of these lands are suitable for summer farming and which are suitable for winter farming.

AB  - Geochemical and petrographical analyses were carried out to investigate the occurrence of calcite in the former Ombilin lacustrine lake. The study involves eight samples taken from a 56 m long drill core of Sangkarewang oil shale. Geochemical investigation showed that the samples consist of varied terrigenous input represented by Si, Al, K, and Ti, and autochthonous input represented by S, total organic carbon (TOC), and Î´13C of bulk organic matter. Along the drill core profile the abundance of autochthonous input decreases upwards, while that of terrigenous input oppositely increases upwards. Petrographical analysis revealed that calcite is a major mineral in the samples. In this study, the abundance of calcite could be represented by the abundance of Ca, as calcite is the only significant Ca containing mineral. Ca is abundant in the samples (8.4% in average) and its concentration varies similarly with those of S, TOC, and Î´13C, suggesting that the element as well as calcite incorporates the autochthonous input. The variation of calcite abundance in the drill core profile is considered to be related with primary productivity changes during the development of the former lake. Higher primary productivity represented by more positive of Î´13C value (-24.8â°) during the deposition of the lower part of the drill core profile promoted the higher amount of deposited organic matter. In such environment, the supersaturation of carbonate ion in lake water was also reached and significant precipitation of authigenic calcite occurred. As the lake developed, the primary productivity decreased as indicated by more negative of Î´13C value (eventually -26.8â°). This condition led to the decreases of deposited organic matter and calcite in the lake sediments.

AB  - A tsunami landslide which caused hundreds casualties and lots of damage took place on Lembata Island in 1979. In order to understand the characteristics of the landslide mechanism, a field survey was conducted in 2013 which sampled both the origin soil and landslide material, and the water from hotspring around the landslide site. The physical properties of the soil obtained show that the original soil has dominantly coarser grain than the landslide material (80.5% coarser grain compared to 11.8% coarse grain respectively) which indicates that the soil has become finer and softer. Hot spring analysis indicated that the mineral content of the water was 99.48% SO4. This shows that magmatism processes are involved which caused the soil to become acidic and may have fragilised the system. Results of X-ray Diffraction Mineralogy Analysis (XRD) show that the original soil is composed of minerals of cristobalite, quartz, and albite, while the landslide material consists of clay minerals such as quartz, saponite, chabazite, silicon oxide, and coesite which are typical minerals in a hydrothermal environment. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the area was influenced by an active geothermal system that could be the main source mechanism behind this disastrous event.

AB  - This study is focused on Middle to Late Miocene sediments. As depicted in the regional geology of Indonesia, the area of study is part of Northeast Java Basin. There are three phases of tectonism in the basin: extensional tectonics at Eocene-Oligocene time, compressional tectonics at Middle Miocene, and compressional tectonics at Miocene-Pliocene time. The result of the study shows three sequences were developing during Middle to Late Miocene, those are: (1) Middle Miocene sequence-1 (MM-1 sequence) consisting of a Lowstand Tract System deposition in Middle Miocene-1 (LST MM-1), Transgressive System Tract deposition in Middle Miocene-1 (TST MM-1), and Highstand System Tract deposition in Middle Miocene-1 (HST MT-2); (2) Middle Miocene sequence-2 (MT-2 sequence), comprising Transgressive System Tract Middle Miocene-1 (TST MM-2), and Highstand System Tract deposition in Middle Miocene-1 (HST MM-2); (3) Late Miocene sequence-1 (LM-1 sequence), composed of a Lowstand Tract System deposition in Late Miocene -1 (LST LM-1) and a Transgressive System Tract deposition in Late Miocene-1 (TST LM-1).

AB  - On May 27 2006, an earthquake (Mw 6.2) occurring in Bantul, Yogyakarta Special Province, triggered liquefaction phenomenon such as sand boiling and lateral spreading. Knowledge of the liquefied soil layers is required to mitigate the hazard. The purpose of this research is to determine the depth and thickness of liquefiable soil layers using the flat blade dilatometer test (DMT) method. The horizontal stress index values (KD) obtained from the DMT were used to calculate the cyclic resistance ratio (CRR), while the PGA (peak ground acceleration) calculated by the software EZ-FRISK 7.52 were employed to determine the cyclic stress ratio (CSR). The DMT-based liquefaction potential analysis shows that the thickness of liquefiable soil layers ranges from 1.8 to 4.0 m. These results show a good agreement with the previous analysis based on CPT (cone penetration test) data. The analysis also indicated that, for the given earthquake magnitude and PGA, the liquefiable soil layers are characterized by a range of maximum KD value from 2.1 to 3.7.

AB  - By applying detailed geological field surveys, the spatial factors affecting geo-engineering stability were used to develop a geo-engineering stability modeling method to identify areas under potential threat of landsliding. The factors affecting geo-engineering stability in Al Qarara area in Petra-Jordan were studied and given assumed rates of importance, where optimization process was run by lag iterations; the produced spatial layers of the different factors were gathered and modeled using GIS; a final stability map was produced using an optimized equation. The produced map was validated qualitatively and quantitatively, where a comparison was made between the reality in the field and several maps of different equation. The modeling method which was developed in the context of this study proved to be suitable to produce micro-zonation maps of areas having landslide risk. Further applications on the method in other areas suffering landslides will further improve it.

AB  - The Triassic rocks of the (West) Timor Basin mainly deposited in the marine environment have been identified. The fine-grained clastic and carbonate rocks of this Triassic marine facies are considered to be the most promising source rocks potential in this basin. Geochemical and petrographic data from outcrop samples of the Triassic carbonate of Aitutu Formation are presented in this paper, in terms of the organic maturation, kerogen type, and the origin of the organic matter. Some representative selected samples were subjected to Rock-Eval Pyrolysis, vitrinite reflectance measurement, and thermal alteration index determination as well as bitumen extraction. The extracts were then analyzed by the GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry). The samples were collected from a marine deposit of the Triassic sequence. The TOC (Total Organic Carbon) values of the analyzed samples range between fair and rich level (0.51% - 9.16%, wt.%, TOC), whilst the kerogen is dominated by Type II with minor Type III. The organic matter was considered to be predominantly oil/gas prone with lesser gas prone potential. The thermal maturity assessed from Tmax, TAI, and vitrinite reflectance shows an immature to early peak mature stage. The biomarkers indicate mainly that the organic matter was derived from mixed source rocks facies containing alga debris and higher plant terrestrial origin.

AB  - The carbonate on Fika Field has a special character, because it grew above a basement high with the thickness and internal character variation. To develop the field, a proper geological model which can be used in reservoir simulation was needed. This model has to represent the complexity of the rock type and the variety of oil types among the clusters. Creating this model was challenging due to the heterogeneity of the Baturaja Formation (BRF): Early Miocene reef, carbonate platform, and breccia conglomerate grew up above the basement with a variety of thickness and quality distributions. The reservoir thickness varies between 23 - 600 ft and 3D seismic frequency ranges from 1 - 80 Hz with 25 Hz dominant frequency. Structurally, the Fika Field has a high basement slope, which has an impact on the flow unit layering slope. Based on production data, each area shows different characteristics and performance: some areas have high water cut and low cumulative production. Oil properties several clusters also vary in wax content. The wax content can potentially build up a deposit inside tubing and flow-line, resulted in a possible disturbance to the operation. Five well cores were analyzed, including thin section and XRD. Seven check-shot data and 3D seismic Pre-Stack Time Migration (PSTM) were available with limited seismic resolution. A seismic analysis was done after well seismic tie was completed. This analysis included paleogeography, depth structure map, and distribution of reservoir and basement. Core and log data generated facies carbonate distribution and rock typing, defining properties for log analysis and permeability prediction for each zone. An Sw prediction for each well was created by J-function analysis. This elaborates capillary pressure from core data, so it is very similar to the real conditions. Different stages of the initial model were done i.e. scale-up properties, data analysis, variogram modeling, and then the properties were distributed using the geostatistic method. Finally, after G & G collaborated with petrophysicists and reservoir engineers to complete their integrated analysis, a geological model was finally created. After that, material balance was needed to confirm reserve calculations. The result of OOIP (Original Oil in Place) and OGIP (Original Gas in Place) were confirmed, because it was similar to the production data and reservoir pressure. The model was then ready to be used in reservoir simulation.

AB  - Fifteen samples were taken ply by ply from a 33 m thick drill core of Muara Wahau coal seams for interpretation of depositional environments. Generally, lithotype variation in the bottom part of the coal seams has a lower frequency than in the upper part. Petrographical analysis was performed to determine the maceral composition, groundwater index (GWI), and gelification index (GI). The samples from lower sections show much higher GWI-GI values and lower variation frequency than from the upper section. This characteristic is interpreted as the result of development of mesotrophic to ombrotrophic peats during the deposition of lower to upper parts of the section, respectively. During the development of the mesotrophic peat, water was more abundant and relatively stable in budget. However, during the development of ombrotrophic peat, water was less abundant and relatively not stable in budget. The latter is related to the water supply depending only on rain, resulted in the more sensitive water table in the ombrotrophic peat. The unstable water table is thought as the reason of higher variation frequency of lithotype, GWI, GI, as well as maceral composition in the upper part of the core. Unstable water table would lead to moist condition in the uppermost layer of the ombrotrophic peat, favoring fungi to grow. This is confirmed by the higher abundance of sclerotinite maceral in samples from the upper part of the coal core.

AB  - The Oligocene Sinamar Formation consists of shale, claystone, mudstone, sandstone, conglomeratic sand stone, and intercalation of coal seams. The objective of study was to identify the hydrocarbon source rock potential of the Sinamar Formation based on geochemichal characteristics. The analyses were focused on fine sediments of the Sinamar Formation comprising shale, claystone, and mudstone. Primary data collected from the Sinamar Formation well and outcrops were analyzed according to TOC, pyrolisis analysis, and gas chromatography - mass spectometry of normal alkanes that include isoprenoids and sterane. The TOC value indicates a very well category. Based on TOC versus Pyrolysis Yields (PY) diagram, the shales of Sinamar Formation are included into oil prone source rock potential with good to excellent categories. Fine sediments of the Sinamar Formation tend to produce oil and gas originated from kerogen types I and III. The shales tend to generate oil than claystone and mudstone and therefore they are included into a potential source rock.

AB  - Variation of Î´13C content in coral skeletons shows the influence of metabolic fractionation in aragonite coral. Understanding coral Î´13C variation can thus be useful to more understand e.g. past bleaching event which is further useful for coral health and conservation. In this study, Î´13C content in Porites coral from Labuhan Bajau, Simeulue Islands was analyzed. To know the correlation between variation of coral Î´13C and light intensity, the monthly variation of coral Î´13C is compared to solar radiation and cloud cover. The result shows that for the period of 2003 to 2008, coral Î´13C shows it is well correlated (r=0.42 p=0.153) with cloud cover variation in annual mean scale. Meanwhile, in seasonal mean variation, coral Î´13C is strongly influenced (r=0.85 p &lt; 0.0001) by cloud cover with 1 - 2 month time lag. Comparing to the solar radiation (cloud cover), SST influences dominantly the variation of coral Î´13C from southern Simeulue Island waters (LB sample) in an annual mean scale than in a seasonal scale.

AB  - The limestone of Klapanunggal Formation is well exposed in Cibinong and its surrounding area, West Java. Detailed observation on carbonate rock has been conducted in this area and aims at the study of the carbonate facies and its growth environment. The method used in the field is the detailed investigation, while micropaleontologic and petrogaphic analyses were conducted in the laboratory. The result of this study indicates that the carbonate rocks in the studied area consist of four facies, namely: (1) boundstone facies, (2) packstone facies, (3) rudstone facies, and (4) limestone breccia facies. Based on these data, it can be interpreted that the boundstone facies was deposited in the reef front to reef crest environment, packstone facies developed on the lower slope, upper slope, and back-reef lagoon environment. Rudstone facies formed on the reef front, and breccia limestone facies formed in the lower slope. Geographically, the position of the carbonate body environment that is at the reef front, upper slope, and lower slope is expected to be in the north - northeast while the reef crest and back reef lagoon is on the South - Southwest.

AB  - Limestones of the Baturaja Formation occur at Air Rambangnia traverse, South Ogan Komering Ulu, South Sumatra, and they are used as objects for microfacies studies. The microfacies studies are based on a detailed petro graphic analysis of thirty four limestone samples, taken from the traverse. Four types of the limestones are identified such as wackestone, packstone, grainstone, and floatstone. At least five microfacies form the limestone succesion of the Baturaja Formation. They are interpreted as sedimentary facies of very restricted bay and pond, back reef local slope, slope and shelf edge, winnowed platform edge sand, and reef flank facies.

AB  - Unstable water table would lead to moist condition in the uppermost layer of the ombrotrophic peat, favoring fungi to grow. This is confirmed by the higher abundance of sclerotinite maceral in samples from the upper part of the coal core. Sandbox experiment is one of the types of analogue modeling in geological sciences in which the main purpose is simulating deformation style and structural evolution of the sedimentary basin. Sandbox modeling is one of the effective ways in conducting physically modeling and evaluates complex deformation of sedimentary rocks. The main purpose of this paper is to evaluate structural geometry and deformation history of oblique convergent deformation using of integrated technique of analogue sandbox modeling applying to deformation of Seram Fold-Thrust-Belt (SFTB) in the Seram Island, Eastern Indonesia. Oblique convergent strike-slip deformation has notoriously generated area with structural complex geometry and pattern resulted from role of various local parameters that control stress distributions. Therefore, a special technique is needed for understanding and solving such problem in particular to relate 3D fault geometry and its evolution. The result of four case (Case 1 to 4) modeling setting indicated that two of modeling variables clearly affected in our sandbox modeling results; these are lithological variation (mainly stratigraphy of Seram Island) and pre-existing basement fault geometry (basement configuration). Lithological variation was mainly affected in the total number of faults development. On the other hand, pre-existing basement fault geometry was highly influenced in the end results particularly fault style and pattern as demonstrated in Case 4 modeling. In addition, this study concluded that deformation in the Seram Island is clearly best described using oblique convergent strike-slip (transpression) stress system.

AB  - This paper discusses characteristics of some key features of the primary Buru gold deposit as a tool better understanding of the deposit genesis. Currently, about 105,000 artisanal and small-scale gold miners (AS are operating in two main localities, i.e.Gogorea and Gunung Botak by digging pits/shafts following gold-be quartz vein orientation. The gold extraction uses mercury (amalgamation) and cyanide processing. The field s identifies two types/generations of quartz veins namely (1) Early quartz veins which are segmented, sigmoidal continous, and parallel to the foliation of host rock. The quartz vein is lack of sulfides, weak mineralized, crysta relatively clear, and maybe poor in gold, and (2) Quartz veins occurred within a 'mineralized zone' of about 1 in width and ~1,000 m in length. The gold mineralization is strongly overprinted by an argillic alteration zone mineralization-alteration zone is probably parallel to the mica schist foliation and strongly controlled by N-S or SW-trending structures. The gold-bearing quartz veins are characterized by banded texture particularly collo following host rock foliation and sulphide banding, brecciated, and rare bladed-like texture. The alteration t consist of propylitic (chlorite, calcite, sericite), argillic, and carbonation represented by graphite banding and ca flakes. The ore mineralization is characterized by pyrite, native gold, pyrrhotite, and arsenopyrite. Cinnabar, stib chalcopyrite, galena, and sphalerite are rare or maybe absent. In general, sulphide minerals are rare (&lt; 3%). Fifteen samples were collected in Wamsaid area for geochemical assaying for Au, Ag, As, Sb, Hg, Cu, Pb, and Zn. Elev fifteen samples yielded more than 1.00 g/t Au, in which six of them are in excess of 3.00 g/t Au. It can be noted all high-grade samples are originally or containing limonitic materials, that suggest the role of supergene enrichm Interestingly, most of the high-grade samples contain also high grade As (up to 991ppm), Sb (up to 885 ppm), an (up to 75 ppm). Fluid inclusions in both quartz vein types consist of four phases including L-rich, V-rich, L-V and L1-L2-V (CO2)-rich phases. Mineralizing hydrothermal fluid is typified by CO2 -rich fluid, moderate temper of 300 - 400Â°C and a typical low salinity (0.36 to 0.54 wt.% NaCl eq). Based on those key features, gold minera tion in Buru Island meets the characteristics of LS epithermal or orogenic gold deposit types; however, it tends fitter with orogenic gold deposit rather than another type.
