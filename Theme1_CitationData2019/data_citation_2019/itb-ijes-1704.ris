AB  - Mineral oil is known to have a low biodegradability level and high susceptibility to the fire. These conditions motivate many researchers to look for alternative sources for insulating oil. One of the alternative liquid is palm oil. To verify the suitability of using palm oil as an insulating liquid, it is important to make dielectric properties comparison with the commonly used insulating liquid. This paper presents comparison of temperature effect on dielectric properties of palm oil with mineral type insulating liquid and silicone oil. The measured parameters were breakdown voltage, dissipation factor (tan δ), and dielectric constant. Breakdown voltage measurement was performed in accordance with IEC 156 standard, whereas, the dissipation factor and dielectric constant measurement were conducted based on IEC 60247 standard test methods. The results showed that variations of dielectric properties of palm oil to the temperature change, in general, have the same tendency with those of commonly used insulating liquids i.e. mineral oil and silicone oil. Breakdown voltages and dissipation factors of all tested oils were increased, while their dielectric constants were slightly decreased with the increase of temperature. © 2011 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - Demand for higher productivity and good quality for machining parts has encourage many researchers to study the effects of machining parameters using FEM simulation using either two or three dimensions version. These are due to advantages such as software package and computational times are required. Experimental work is very costly, time consuming and labor intensive. The present work aims to simulate a three-dimensional orthogonal cutting operations using FEM software (deform-3D) to study the effects of rake angle on the cutting force, effective stress, strain and temperature on the edge of carbide cutting tool. There were seven runs of simulations. All simulations were performed for various rake angles of -15 deg, -10 deg, -5 deg, 0 deg, +5 deg, +10 deg, and +15 deg. The cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut (DOC) were kept constant at 100 m/min, 0.35 mm/rev and 0.3 mm respectively. The work piece used was ductile cast iron FCD500 grade and the cutting tool was DNMA432 series (tungsten, uncoated carbide tool, SCEA = 0; and radius angle 55 deg). The analysis of results show that, the increase in the rake angle from negative to positive angle, causing the decrease in cutting force, effective stress and total Von Misses strain. The minimum of the cutting force, effective stress and total Von Misses strain were obtained at rake angle of +15 deg. Increasing the rake caused higher temperature generated on the edge of carbide cutting tool and resulted in bigger contact area between the clearance face and the workpiece, consequently caused more friction and wear. The biggest deformation was occurred in the primary deformation zone, followed by the secondary deformation zone. The highest stress was also occurred in the primary deformation zone. But the highest temperature on the chip usually occurs in secondary deformation zone, especially in the sliding region, because the heat that was generated in the sticking region increased as the workpiece was adhered by the tool and later it was sheared in high frictional force.

AB  - Vertical-axis hydrokinetic turbines with fixed pitch blades typically suffer from poor starting torque, low efficiency and shaking due to large fluctuations in both radial and tangential force with azimuth angle. Maximizing the turbine power output can be achieved only if the mechanism of generation of the hydrodynamic force on the blades is clearly identified and tools to design high-performance rotors are developed. This paper describes an initial experimental investigation to understand more of the performance on vertical-axis turbine related to the effect of fixed-pitch and passive variable-pitch application using airfoil NACA 0018. Comparative analysis according to aspects of rotation and tip speed ratios was discussed. Information regarding the changes of foil position in passive variable-pitch during rotation at a limited range of flow velocity variations test was obtained and analyzed.

AB  - An experimental study of 23 low-, medium- and high-strength concrete columns is presented in this paper. Square-confined concrete columns without longitudinal reinforcement were designed, and tested under concentric axial compression. The columns were made of concrete with a compressive strength ranging between 30 MPa and 70 MPa. The test parameters in the study are concrete compressive strengths and confining steel properties, i.e. spacing, volumetric ratios and configurations. The effects of these parameters on the strength and ductility of square-confined concrete were evaluated. Of the specimens tested in this study, the columns made with higher-strength concrete produced less strength enhancement and ductility than those with lower-strength concrete. The steel configurations were found to have an important role in governing the strength and ductility of the confined high-strength concrete. Moreover, several models of strength enhancement for confined concrete available in the literature turned out to be quite accurate in predicting the experimental results. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - This paper discusses a study of the application of global spatiotemporal climate datasets and the hydrological model STREAM (Spatial Tools for River Basin Environmental Analysis and Management Options). In the study, set up and calibration of STREAM for the reconstruction of monthly discharge for several locations in the western part of Java, Indonesia, for the period 1983-2002 are carried out. The set up includes the preparation of monthly precipitation and temperature datasets, a digital elevation model of the domain being studied, and maps of land cover and soil water holding capacity. Discharge observations from six stations located mostly in the upper parts of major watersheds in the domain are used to calibrate the model by comparing simulated and observed discharge variables. The model performs reasonably well. Comparison between computed and observed mean monthly discharges yield correlation coefficients ranging from 0.72 to 0.93. The computed mean annual discharge in five out of six observation stations ranges between -8 and 5% with respect to the mean annual observed discharge. This study offers a tool which can be used for reconstructing historical discharge.

AB  - The acid failure of aluminium alloy in 2 M hydrochloric acid solution in the presence of Vernonia amygdalina extract was investigated using gasometric technique. Aluminium alloy coupons of dimension 4 cm by 1 cm were immersed in test solutions of free acid and also those containing extract volumes of 2, 3, 4 and 5 cm 3 at ambient temperature for 30 minutes. The volumes of hydrogen gas evolved as a result of the rate of reaction were recorded and analyzed. Analysis revealed that maximum inhibitor efficiency which corresponds to the lowest corrosion rate was obtained at optimum inhibitor volumes of 5 cm 3, with reduction in the corrosion rate observed to follow in order of increasing extract volumes. Adsorption study revealed that Temkin isotherm best described the metal surface interaction with the extract phytochemicals, with 12 minutes becoming the best exposure time for the phytochemicals to adsorb to the metal surface at all volumes. Statistical modelling of the corrosion rate yielded an important relationship suitable for estimating corrosion rate values once volumes of the extract is known. Microstructural studies, showed an indirect relationship between crack growth rates and extract volumes, while consistency of the irregular intermetallic phases increases with increasing extract volumes. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB &amp; PII.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to propose an obstacle avoidance method for service robots in indoor environments using vision and ultrasonic sensors. The service robot in this research is programmed to deliver a drinking cup to the recognized customer from a specified starting point. We have developed three main modules: one for face recognition, one to identify obstacles, and one to maneuver. The detection of static obstacles, which is based on information from the landmark, uses an edge-detection method and is used to generate a planned path. The speed, direction and distance of the moving obstacle are measured by using vision and distance sensors in order for the robot to make a maneuver. Algorithms for obstacle avoidance for service robots are proposed and a new geometrical model is introduced for service robots to make a good avoidance maneuver. The main aim of this research is to provide a complete mechanism for obstacle avoidance by a vision-based service robot, whereas popular obstacle avoidance methods such as PVM do not provide such a feature. We present the results of an experiment with a service robot in which our proposed method was implemented, after which we evaluate its performance.

AB  - This paper presents results of numerical and experimental study of shear link behavior, utilizing diagonal stiffener on web of steel profile to increase shear link performance in an eccentric braced frame (EBF) of a steel structure system. The specimen is to examine the behavior of shear link by using diagonal stiffener on web part under static monotonic and cyclic load. The cyclic loading pattern conducted in the experiment is adjusted according to AISC loading standards 2005. Analysis was carried out using non-linear finite element method using MSC/NASTRAN software. Link was modeled as CQUAD shell element. Along the boundary of the loading area the nodal are constraint to produce only one direction loading. The length of the link in this analysis is 400mm of the steel profile of WF 200.100. Important parameters considered to effect significantly to the performance of shear link have been analyzed, namely flange and web thicknesses, thickness and length of web stiffener, thickness of diagonal stiffener and geometric of diagonal stiffener. The behavior of shear link with diagonal web stiffener was compared with the behavior of standard link designed based on AISC 2005 criteria. Analysis results show that diagonal web stiffener is capable to increase shear link performance in terms of stiffness, strength and energy dissipation in supporting lateral load. However, differences in displacement ductility's between shear links with diagonal stiffener and shear links based on AISC standards have not shown to be significant. Analysis results also show thickness of diagonal stiffener and geometric model of stiffener to have a significant influence on the performance of shear links. To perform validation of the numerical study, the research is followed by experimental work conducted in Structural Mechanic Laboratory Center for Industrial Engineering ITB. The Structures and Mechanics Lab rotary PAU-ITB. The experiments were carried out using three test specimens with model and dimension identical to the model in the numerical study. Experimental testing apparently has shown results of the same behavior as predicted in the numerical study. However, when it is compared to the shape of the hysterical curve, a slight difference is apparent. This is due to the influence of stiffness of bolt joints and the supports which is difficult to model precisely in the numerical studies.

AB  - Integrated geoelectrical resistivity, hydrogeochemical and soil properties analysis methods were used to study the area that has been applied with fertilization for long duration and non-Fertilization in Machang, North Kelantan. The Machang plain is covered with Quaternary fluvial sediments overlying granite bedrock. The drainage system is dendritic with the main river flowing into the South China Sea. In this study, the area was divided into two sites. Site-1 is the non-fertilized site, and Site-2 is the regularly-fertilized site. At shallow depth from the surface to depths of 75 cm a lower average geoelectrical resistivity values were obtained from the regularly fertilized site which has not been fertilized for the last ten months prior to the survey. The average resistivity values were around 0.366 times less in unfertilized sites. Residual nitrate and chloride were still present at the regularly chemically fertilized sites. At sites where no chemical fertilizer was added, the nitrate and chloride concentration were also found. These are due to the faces excretion of from the farm animals. The presence of nitrate and chloride content in pore water reduced the resistivity values. Thus despite low moisture content, the resistivity values to remain low. Normally, resistivity values are inversely proportional to moisture content for area with similar soil condition.

AB  - Comparing the quality of basic reservoir rock properties is a common practice to locate new infills or development wells for optimizing an oil field development using a reservoir simulation. The conventional technique employs a manual trial and error process to find new well locations, which proves to be time-consuming, especially, for a large field. Concerning this practical matter, an alternative in the form of a robust technique was introduced in order that time and efforts could be reduced in finding best new well locations capable of producing the highest oil recovery. The objective of the research was to apply Genetic Algorithm (GA) in determining wells locations using reservoir simulation to avoid the manual conventional trial and error method. GA involved the basic rock properties, i.e., porosity, permeability, and oil saturation, of each grid block obtained from a reservoir simulation model, which was applied into a newly generated fitness function formulated through translating the common engineering practice in the reservoir simulation into a mathematical equation and then into a computer program. The maximum of the fitness value indicated a final searching of the best grid location for a new well location. In order to evaluate the performance of the generated GA program, two fields that had different production profile characteristics, namely the X and Y fields, were applied to validate the proposed method. The proposed GA method proved to be a robust and accurate method to find the best new well locations for field development. The key success of this proposed GA method is in the formulation of the objective function. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - The price volatility and scarcity have been became a great problem in the distribution system of seasonal staple food produced by agro industry. It has salient supply disparity during the harvest and planting season. This condition could cause disadvantages to the stakeholders such as producer, wholesaler, consumer, and government. This paper proposes a buffer stock model under free trade considerations to substitute quantitative restrictions and tariffs by indirect market intervention instrument. The instrument was developed through buffer stock scheme in accordance with warehouse receipt system (WRS) and collateral management system. The public service institution for staple food buffer stock (BLUPP) is proposed as wholesaler's competitor with main responsibility to ensure price stabilization and availability of staple food. Multi criteria decision making is formulated as single objective a mixed integer non linear programming (MINLP). The result shows that the proposed model can be applied to solve the distribution problem and can give more promising outcome than its counterpart, the direct market intervention instrument. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - Properties of fresh concrete made in tropical countries, which is mixed, transported (with agitation), placed and initially cured in places where the temperature ranges from about 20°C to 40°C and relative humidity above 60%, are not completely understood. Applicable requirements also differ from country to country and government agencies and private enterprises have their own specifications. Assuming such temperature and relative humidity conditions, the present study is an attempt at evaluating the properties of hot weather concrete in fresh state with using a method of ready-mixed concrete. The fresh concrete was mixed and agitated at varying concrete and ambient temperatures. Three groups of the component materials, each material having such temperature as to bring resulting temperature of the fresh concrete to about 20°C, 30°C, 35°C, were chosen. The temperature of cement was conditioned to about20°, 40°C and 60°C for each of groups respectively. The aggregate was made warm enough to simulate the condition of outdoor pile in ready-mixed concrete plant. The temperature of tap water was always 20 ° C as it was easily controlled and unlikely affected by outdoor temperature. With the fresh concrete prevented from evaporation, slump loss is caused solely by increased temperature of concrete. During agitation, the slump loss increases rapidly during the first 30 minutes but moderately during the remaining period. Concrete-placing temperature (upon arrival at the work site) could be estimated by a proposed formula derived from this study. Besides the freshly mixed concrete temperature, this formula also takes into consideration the ambient temperature, agitating time in transit and hydration heat. The achievement as described in this study may be useful to control concrete quality in terms of strength, shrinkage and other properties of concrete to be placed in hot-humid environment. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB &amp; PII.

AB  - The sorption and the degradation capacity of natural estrogens in freshwater environmental system in Japan were performed. Batch experiments were examined in water-sediment suspensions using six layers of sediment under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The results indicated that the water-sediment partition coefficient of E1 (Kd E1) was higher than E2 (Kd E2). The degradation rate of E1 (kE1) was smaller than E2 (kE2). Under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, E1 was formed from E2. The degradation rate of E2 (kE2) from the surface to bottom of sediment layers was estimated fell in the range from 0.114 to 0.026 h-1 and 0.05 to 0.014 h-1 under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively.

AB  - Laccase has been produced in a solid state fermentation (SSF) using white rot fungi and various lignocellulosic based substrates. White rot fungi used were Marasmius sp, Trametes hirsuta, Trametes versicolor and Phanerochaete crysosporium. The solid substrates employed in this research were collected from agriculture waste which were empty fruit bunches (EFB), rice straw, corn cob, and rice husk. The objective of this research was to determine the most promising fungus, the best solid substrate and the optimal conditions for the production of laccase. The results showed that Marasmius sp. on all solid substrates displayed higher laccase activity than that of any other strain of white rot fungi. Marasmius sp. and solid substrate of rice straw demonstrated the highest laccase activity of 1116.11 U/L on day 10. Three significant factors, i.e. pH, temperature and yeast extract concentration were studied by response surface method on laccase production using Marasmius sp and rice straw. The optimized conditions were pH, temperature and yeast extract concentration of 4.9, 31oC and 0.36 g/L respectively. The fermentation of Marasmius sp. in SSF on agricultural waste shows a great potential for the production of laccase. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB &amp; PII.

AB  - Continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) observations showed significant crustal displacements as a result of the Bengkulu earthquake occurring on September 12, 2007. A maximum horizontal displacement of 2.11 m was observed at PRKB station, while the vertical component at BSAT station was uplifted with a maximum of 0.73 m, and the vertical component at LAIS station was subsided by -0.97 m. The method of adding more constraint on the inversion for the Bengkulu earthquake slip distribution from GPS observations can help solve a least squares inversion with an under-determined condition. Checkerboard tests were performed to help conduct the weighting for constraining the inversion. The inversion calculation of the Bengkulu earthquake slip distribution yielded in an optimum value of slip distribution by giving a weight of smoothing constraint of 0.001 and a weight of slip value constraint = 0 at the edge of the earthquake rupture area. A maximum coseismic slip of the optimal inversion calculation was 5.12 m at the lower area of PRKB and BSAT stations. The seismic moment calculated from the optimal slip distribution was 7.14 × 1021 Nm, which is equivalent to a magnitude of 8.5. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - We have studied the preparation of organic-inorganic hybrid polymer precursors by sol-gel technique and their utilization for nanostructured optical components for photonic applications. The gel polymer precursors were prepared from siloxane modified by polymerizable acrylate groups, which can be processed further by photopolymerization process. Molecular structure characterizations by means of the FTIR measurements indicate the conversion of C=C bonds into C-C bonds after photopolymerization. This bond conversion produces high cross-linking between the organic and inorganic moieties, resulting in thermally stable and chemically resistant thin polymer layer which provide unique advantages of this material for particular optical/photonic applications. By employing laser interference technique, gratings with periodicity between 400-1000 nm have been successfully fabricated. Application of those sub-micron periodicity of grating structure as active elements in optically pumped polymer laser system and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) based measurement system have been also explored. The experimental results therefore also show the potential applications of this hybrid polymer as a building material for micro/nano-photonics components. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - Gas permeability and intrinsic permeability are the major parameters to promote aeration for packed waste. The objectives of this research are to identify physical parameters of gas transfer from a various type of packed wastes and examine ventilation design theory for landfill to enhance waste stabilization. Method to determine value of gas permeability and intrinsic permeability for packed waste is by flushing the packed column containing various type and physical characteristics of wastes with an air pump. Permeability was calculated by measuring pressure gradient on sampling points of the column using inclined manometer at distance 10 cm, 23 cm, 46 cm, 69 cm, 92 cm and 115 cm from origin. Gas permeability is specifically relied on physical parameters of wastes as follows, density, moisture content, particle size and gas velocity on the surface of compacted waste layer. Compost has finer pore structure and smaller pore size than leaves as well as mixed organic (65%) and inorganic wastes (35%). The experiment found the intrinsic permeability of leaves waste are in the order of 10-11 to 10-8 m2, 10-11 to 10-9 m2 for compost and 10-9 m2 for mixed organic (65%) and inorganic wastes (35%).

AB  - In many industrial plants, some key variables cannot always be measured on-line and for the purpose of control, an alternative of sensing system is required. This paper is concerned with a development of an alternative intelligent control strategy, which is an integration between the neuro-fuzzy based controller and virtual sensing system. This allows an immeasurable variable to be inferred and used for control. The virtual sensor is composed of the Diagonal Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) for plant modeling and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) as the estimator with inputs from DRNN. The integration between virtual sensor and the controller enables a development of an on-line control scheme involving the immeasurable variable. The real-time implementation demonstrates the applicability and the performance of the proposed intelligent control scheme, especially in dealing with nonlinear processes.

AB  - The present study is an attempt to introduce a method for optimizing the geometry of a unit process. The comprehensive unit process performances are generated by a CFD engine. The CFD engine can simulate the unit process performances at whatever conditions. Both design geometry and operating variables were used on the CFD simulation. The burden on a simplified process was taken out from CFD simulation. A complex geometry of a unit process is represented by a secondary reformer. A secondary reformer has a conical chamber as a space to undergo a combustion reaction before entering a catalyst bed. This complexity is added by the boundary on a porous solid surface as the top surface of the catalyst bed. The conical angle affects the flow pattern inside the conical chamber having a porous solid surface as its base. The conical angle above 65° results the disappearing of the recirculation flow. The inlet distance from the porous solid surface also can exhibit different characteristics of recirculation flow. The closer the distance to the porous solid surface, the stronger the recirculation is. The inlet velocity values have no significant effect on the flow pattern. The introduction of a solid volume inside the geometry creates distortion in the flow pattern. In the application, the inserted solid volume is equivalent to a burner. It means that the use of the burner inherently produces some problems of the flow distribution.

AB  - The storage effects on the oxidation characteristics of fatty acid methyl ester of canola oil (CME) were investigated in this study.CME stabilised with two antioxidants, i.e.2,6-di-tert-bytyl-p-cresol (BHT) and 6,6-di-tert-butyl- 2, 2'-methylendi-p-cresol (BPH), was stored at 20, 40 and 60°C.The oxidation stability data were measured by the Rancimat test method and it was found that both BHT and BPH addition increased the oxidation resistance of the CME. The results showed that when BPH or BHT was added at a concentration of 100 ppm, the oxidation induction period of the neat CME samples increased from 5.53 h to 6.93 hand 6.14h, respectively. Comparing both antioxidants, BPH proved to be more effective in increasing the oxidation resistance when both antioxidants were added at the same concentration. Furthermore, the oxidation induction time decreased linearly with the storage time. It was shown that the oxidation occurred rapidly in the first 8 weeks of storage. Later, a kinetic study was undertaken and first-order kinetics were applied to explain the oxidation characteristics of the CME added with antioxidants. This kinetic study focused on exploiting the activation energy values obtained from the Arrhenius equations. Also, the oxidation effects on other quality parameters, including acid value, peroxide value, kinematic viscosity, and water content, were examined. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - In this work we have investigated mixing in a modified orbiting screw mixer (MOSM) designed for solid-solid mixing. Mixing was carried out using urea powder and natural zeolite powder (UZ) of three varying particle sizes (50- 60, 60-80 and 80 mesh). Power consumption was calculated from the measured torque of orbit and screw, obtained from computerized records. It was found that the mixing process in the modified orbiting screw mixer with air injection required a lower power consumption for each particle-size group when compared to mixing without air injection. With UZ mixing in MOSM with air injection, the lowest E was obtained for the 60-80 mesh particle-size group (4,297 Joule/kg-1), whereas when mixing without air injection, the value was 10,296 J/kg. The best mixing operation in this experiment was achieved at NFr = 1.18x10-3 and in the range of values NRe ≈ 8.77x107 to 2.63x108. Moreover, in this study, we have developed an equation to estimate the power consumption required for mixing and determined its correlation with dimensionless numbers. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - This paper presents an improvement model of the effective moment of inertia to predict the short term deflection of reinforced lightweight concrete beam. The models were developed using 9 beams of reinforced pumicelightweight concrete tested under two symmetrical-point loads. The presence of steel reinforcement in the beam was taken into consideration in the developed model. The models were verified by test carried out on other 9 beams. Those beams subjected to various-point loads and compressive strength. The results of investigation revealed that crack moment of inertia increased with the increased tensile reinforcement ratio. Thus, the reinforcement ratio significantly affects the value of effective moment of inertia of reinforced lightweight concrete beam. All the beam test results produced considerable deflection in comparison to that obtained using current Codes either ACI or SNI. The proposed model demonstrated a good agreement to the experimental results and in some cases have similar trend to that of the ACI or SNI prediction. © 2011 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - Kaolin has been identified as a potential raw material for the production of γ-Al 2 O 3 for hydrotreating catalyst support. This work explores the technical feasibility of applying the potassium hydroxide (KOH) extraction synthesis route on kaolin from the Belitung Island in Indonesia. The application of a published synthesis method to Belitung kaolin requires an approximately twofold increase in kaolin calcination time, an increase in kaolin calcinations temperature from 950 to 1000°C, and a tenfold increase in metakaolin extraction time, to obtain a specific surface area higher than 200 m 2 /g. The highest specific surface area of 233 m 2 /g was obtained when the kaolin was calcined at 1000°C for 24 hours, and the metakaolin was extracted by concentrated KOH solution for 12 hours. Phase characterization of the final product confirmed the formation of γ-Al 2 O 3 , but with the inclusion of low-surface area α-Al 2 O 3 phase.

AB  - Pt-Ni/C alloy nanocatalysts synthesized by polyol method with different atomic ratio are investigated to enhance activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for fuel cell applications. Prepared catalysts are characterized by various techniques, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDX), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). XRD analysis shows that all prepared catalysts with different atomic ratio exhibit face centered cubic and have smaller lattice parameters than pure Pt catalyst. The mean particle size of the catalysts are between 4.3 to 6.3 nm. Cyclic voltammograms with scan rate 5 mV s-1 at 25°C obtain range the electrochemical active surface (EAS) between 40 to 164 cm2/mgPt, mass activity (MA) and specific activity (SA) of nanocatalysts PtNi/C in the potential range 900 mV versus RHE between 3.61 to 8.42 mA/mgPt, and 0.05 to 0.09.

AB  - The effectiveness of a breakwater can be measured by quantifying the transmission coefficient (KT). The smaller the coefficient, the better the performance of the breakwater. A physical modeling on the proposed breakwater was conducted to identify the coefficient of Perforated Skirt Breakwater (PSB). The PSB model was tested in 2-D wave flume at Ocean Wave Research Laboratory FTSL ITB, to obtain the effectiveness of PSB for short-period waves (prototype periods, Tp= 4 second and smaller). The scaling of PSB models applies the principle of Froude Similarity, where the Froude number in model equals to the Froude number in prototype (Frm=Frp). The flume is equipped with 5 resistance-type wave probes and 8-channel DAS (Data Acquisition System). Wave heights (H) and wave periods (T) data were observed both manually by visual observation and wave probes readings (processed later with method of "zero mean up-crossing" technique). The incoming wave heights (Hi) and transmitted wave heights (Ht) were measured and processed to obtain the transmission coefficient (KT). The relationships between KT and non-dimensional variables (skirt draft/incident wave height, S/Hi) are analyzed and the calculated effectiveness of the PSB for varied environmental condition is obtained to be up to 70%.

AB  - Sr/Ca has been analyzed from coral core from the Seribu Islands reef complex i.e Jukung Island. SST from ERSST dataset and air temperature measured at Jakarta is used for Sr/Ca calibration. The results show that Jukung Island coral Sr/Ca correlates better with SST than with air temperature. A comparison between the Sr/Ca records with the Nino 3.4 index shows that Jukung coral sites indicate warming sea surface temperatures during the beginning of El Nino events followed by cooling temperatures at the end of El Nino years.

AB  - This paper presents the closed form solution of the synchronous machine transients undergoing short circuit. That analytic formulation has been derived based on linearity and balanced conditions of the fault. Even though restrictive, the proposed method will serve somehow or other as a new resource for EMTP productivity. Indisputably superior, the closed-form formulation has some features inimitable by discretization such as continuity, accuracy and absolute numerical stability. Moreover, it enables us to calculate states at one specific instant independent of previous states or a snapshot, which any discretization methods cannot do.

AB  - We report the fabrication of microporous filter for use in filtering both inorganic and organic substances from liquid materials. Titania (TiO2) anatase was used as the main material for this filter. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) with average molecular weight of 20,000 was also used as additive to control the formation of pores, especially pore sizes. The mixture of titania and PEG was pressed into cylindrical tablet shape at room temperature and then simply heated inside a furnace up to temperature where the PEG decomposed into gas to leave only connected titania particles. The use of titania as base material for the filter allows the organic substances that trapped inside the filter pores to be easily removed by heating up the used filter at above decomposition temperature of the trapped organics. We also made other filter by adding small amount of silica (SiO2) particles to reduce the size of the pores as well as to improve the mechanical strength. We observed that filters containing silica particles, with smaller in size compared to titania, resulted in better mechanical strength, smaller in pore sizes and better filtering results in term of turbidity and dissolved oxygen (DO) content. This method is potential for development of larger scale and cheaper water filters for use in various applications.

AB  - The modern food industry and a variety of food products require tolerant starch as raw material for processing in a broad range of techniques, from preparation to storage and distribution. Dual modification of arrowroot starch using hydroxypropylation and cross-linking was carried out to overcome the lack of native arrowroot starch in food processing application. The modifications applied were: combined propylene oxide (8%, 10%, and 12%); sodium tri meta phosphate/STMP (1%, 2%, and 3%); and sodium tri poly phosphate/STPP (4%, 5%, and 6%). These modifications significantly affected the composition of the amylose and amylopectin and the amount of phosphorus in the granules. Higher amounts of phosphate salt gave a higher phosphorus content, which increased the degree of substitution (DS) and the degree of cross-link. Arrowroot starch that was modified using a concentration of 8-10% propylene oxide and 1-2% STMP: 3-5% STPP produced a starch with < 0.4% phosphorus content. A higher concentration of propylene oxide provided a higher degree of hydroxypropyl. The changed physical properties of the modified granular arrowroot starch were examined through SEM testing, and its changed crystalline patterns through X-ray diffraction measurements. Especially, provision of a high concentration of propylene oxide (12%) combined with 3% STMP: 6% STPP affected the granular morphology and the crystallinity. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In an orthotropic material, the grain angle has a significant influence on its mechanical properties. The aim of this research was to perform a numerical simulation using a nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) to obtain the compression strength of the Red Meranti (shorea spp.) timber species at an angle to the grain ranging from 12° to 80°. The material properties needed for the analysis were obtained from clear specimen tests. To investigate the validity of the numerical results, various cross grain specimens were tested under uniaxial compressive stress. It has been shown in this study that an FEA based on the distortion energy of an orthotropic material can be used to obtain the compressive strength at proportional limit for cross grain specimens. Comparison with the experimental results showed that for a cross grain angle between 12° and 80° the FEA predicted the strength to be 9.4% to 33.6% lower than the experimental results. Compared to using Hankinson's formula to predict the compressive strength at a cross grain angle, using the FEA always gave a lower value, ranging from 13.2% to 30.5%. Based on these results, an FEA incorporating Hill's yield criterion is a conservative method for predicting compressive strength at an angle to the grain. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - An approximate solution of longitudinal dispersion phenomena occurring in two phase miscible fluid flow through porous media has been obtained by using the group theoretic approach. The longitudinal dispersion coefficient is assumed to be directly proportional to the concentration of the fluid for a distance x and at any time t > 0. The graphical representation for the concentration of the fluid for a distance x and at time t > 0 has been obtained using Mat lab coding. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - Detailed investigations of landslides are essential to understand fundamental landslide mechanisms. Seismic refraction method has been proven as a useful geophysical tool for investigating shallow landslides. The objective of this study is to introduce a new workflow using neural network in analyzing seismic refraction data and to compare the result with some methods; that are general reciprocal method (GRM) and refraction tomography. The GRM is effective when the velocity structure is relatively simple and refractors are gently dipping. Refraction tomography is capable of modeling the complex velocity structures of landslides. Neural network is found to be more potential in application especially in time consuming and complicated numerical methods. Neural network seem to have the ability to establish a relationship between an input and output space for mapping seismic velocity. Therefore, we made a preliminary attempt to evaluate the applicability of neural network to determine velocity and elevation of subsurface synthetic models corresponding to arrival times. The training and testing process of the neural network is successfully accomplished using the synthetic data. Furthermore, we evaluated the neural network using observed data. The result of the evaluation indicates that the neural network can compute velocity and elevation corresponding to arrival times. The similarity of those models shows the success of neural network as a new alternative in seismic refraction data interpretation. © 2011 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - This paper demonstrates a new alternative way in estimating seismically thin-bed (below-tuning) thickness. Initial thickness is built by bandpass filtering the amplitude display of a zero-phase seismic. The filter removes the non minimum and or non maximum and left the maximum and or the minimum of seismic amplitude. The unresolved below-tuning thickness is then corrected by zero-INTENS-difference (z-i-d) attribute. INTENS is integrated energy spectra, an attribute which can be derived from spectral analysis. z-i-d attribute is zero difference of INTENS between the seismic and its synthetic. The method generates INTENS difference profile by subtracting seismic INTENS and its synthetic INTENS iteratively. The iteration is controlled by dipole space shifting from distance to closer or vice versa. The true thickness is derived by locating z-i-d which laid in INTENS different profile. It has found that, for free noise true seismic and perfect-wavelet (a wavelet which only approximately similar with wavelet which constructing the true seismic) synthetic seismic, in INTENS different profile, the z-i-d location always corresponds to true dipole space or thickness. The method could resolve all thickness of a wedge-modeled seismic with three different dominant frequencies. When the synthetic seismic is constructed with imperfect wavelet, slightly different analysis is needed to locate z-i-d attribute and the result is not as perfect as when perfect wavelet constructing synthetic seismic. A quiet similar result is got when the method is implemented for noisy wedge-modeled seismic. Bad thickness estimation is resulted for 20% noise seismic. The method algorithm is extended for similar dipole polarity model and multilayer model to bring the method to real seismic data nearer. The extension is done by estimating thickness of every layer of a stacked-wedge-modeled seismic. The algorithm then generalized for estimating layers thickness with several thickness combinations. The method was able to delineate shallow channel of Stratton Field by providing good pseudo-acousticimpedance (pseudo AI) map.

AB  - Agglomeration of granulated Buton natural asphalt during storage is of major concern in its large-scale commercial application. This work develops a simple test method to evaluate the performance of agglomeration-resistant coating for granulated Buton asphalt, consisting of water-based polymeric primary coating and mineral-based secondary coating. The method uses a static load cell to measure the agglomerated granule count fraction under simulated storage conditions. A 2 4-1 fractional factorial experiment with two replications is employed to evaluate the effect of coating drying temperature, drying time, asphalt to secondary coating mass ratio, and secondary coating type on the agglomerated count fraction at ambient temperature and 60°C. The test is able to measure a statistically significant increase in agglomeration resistance when the coating is applied, with an agglomerated fraction of 17.5% at 60 °C. The test identifies asphalt to secondary coating weight ratio as a significant factor, with an ANOVA p-value much lower than other effects. A decrease in this mass ratio from 5:1 to 5:2 increases the agglomeration, which is hypothesized to be attributed to the hydrated cementitious phase between granular external surfaces. More work is needed to identify the acceptable fraction of agglomerated granules.

AB  - Most of existing adaptive control schemes are designed to minimize error between plant state and goal state despite the fact that executing actions that are predicted to result in smaller errors only can mislead to non-goal states. We develop an adaptive control scheme that involves manipulating a controller of a general type to improve its performance as measured by an evaluation function. The developed method is closely related to a theory of Reinforcement Learning (RL) but imposes a practical assumption made for faster learning. We assume that a value function of RL can be approximated by a function of Euclidean distance from a goal state and an action executed at the state. And, we propose to use it for the gradient search as an evaluation function. Simulation results provided through application of the proposed scheme to a pole-balancing problem using a linear state feedback controller and fuzzy controller verify the scheme's efficacy.

AB  - Mariculture (marine aquaculture) has been intensified and has created essential employment opportunities over the last two-decades in Indonesia, as well as many other countries in the world. This development has negative impact to the environment. Considerable amounts of nutrient waste in dissolved and particulate form were released by intensive fish farming into the environment through feed excess, soluble fish excretion and faeces production. One of the first steps to avoid the dangerous environmental impacts is careful site selection to minimize environmental impacts arising from the farming activities (sustainability) as well as to guarantee adequate conditions from the operational point of view (suitability).The paper focuses on the development of a Decision Support System (DSS) as a tool for the appropriate selection of mariculture site location. The DSS is based on physical, chemical and sediment criteria as well as on data of conflicting coastal use. The GIS analysis results in a map indicating the suitable areas for the improved method of offshore cage mariculture. In this study, emphasis was placed on finfish species; however the methods and results may be employed for other species as well following some modifications. The DSS was applied for the western part of Java Sea, Indonesia. The data were acquired from direct field measurement, numerical modeling and existing information from particular agencies. Numerical modeling was used to obtain spatial and temporal distributions of hydrodynamic parameters (i.e. current velocities and water levels). The Delft3D modeling system (Delft Hydraulics, The Netherlands) was employed for this purpose. The DSS was developed under GIS application of ESRI® ArcGIS TM using weighted overlay method. The results showed the adequacy of the system for supporting governmental authorities in the implementation, environmental controlling, and estimation of overall carrying capacity for environmental sustainable marine fish farming.

AB  - The behavior of a free-hanging riser of floating offshore structures would be different from a typical at-sea-floor-terminated riser type of oil or gas platforms. For the design purpose, the present study was intended to incorporate some important factors of the riser conditions (i.e. bidirectional vibration, free-end condition, and spanwise variation of response amplitude) for investigating its dynamics characteristics. An experimental investigation on time-dependent motion of a flexible free-hanging circular cantilever subjected to uniform cross-flows has been carried out. The free-end condition cantilever has a 34.4 aspect ratio and a low mass ratio of about 1.24. The cylinder freely oscillates in both inline and transverse to the flow. Reynolds number varied from 10,800 to 37,800. The "jump phenomenon" was found in the inline motion of the cylinder that agrees well with an existing comparable work. At high flow velocities, the 3rd higher harmonic frequencies of the cylinder transverse response became predominant that produce quite different motion characteristics compared to the other existing comparable works with 2-dimensional bottom-end condition. Generally, the results suggested that the flexible free-hanging cantilever generate different vortex wake mode than either, a uniform (a short-rigid flexibly-mounted cylinder) or a linear amplitude variation along the span case (a pivoted cylinder).

AB  - The applicability of parameter varying reduced order controllers to aircraft model is proposed. The generalization of the balanced singular perturbation method of linear time invariant (LTI) system is used to reduce the order of linear parameter varying (LPV) system. Based on the reduced order model the low-order LPV controller is designed by using HH∞ synthesis technique. The performance of the reduced order controller is examined by applying it to lateral-directional control of aircraft model having 20th order. Furthermore, the time responses of the closed loop system with reduced order LPV controllers and reduced order LTI controller is compared. From the simulation results, the 8th order LPV controller can maintain stability and to provide the same level of closed-loop systems performance as the full-order LPV controller. It is different with the reduced-order LTI controller that cannot maintain stability and performance for all allowable parameter trajectories. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - One of the important requirements for earthquake resistant building related to confinement is the use of seismic hooks in the hoop or confining reinforcement of reinforced-concrete column elements. However, installation of a confining reinforcement with a 135-degree hook is not easy. Therefore, in practice, many construction workers apply a confining reinforcement with a 90- degreehook (non-code compliant). Based on research and records of recent earthquakes in Indonesia, the use of a non-code compliant confining reinforcement for concrete columns produces structures with poor seismic performance. This paper presents a study that introduces an additional element that is expected to improve the effectiveness of concrete columns confined with a non-code compliant confining reinforcement. The additional element, named a pen-binder, is used to keep the non-code compliant confining reinforcement in place. The effectiveness of this element under pure axial concentric loading was investigatedcomprehensively.The specimens tested in this study were 18 concrete columns,with a cross-section of 170 mm x 170 mm and a height of 480 mm. The main test variables were the material type of the pen-binder, the angle of the hook, and the confining reinforcement configuration.The test results indicate that adding pen-binders can effectively improve the strength and ductility of the column specimens confined with a non-code compliant confining reinforcement. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - The use of flare gas as injection gas in miscible gas flooding enhanced oil recovery (MGF-EOR) presents a potential synergy between oil production improvement and greenhouse gases emission mitigation. This work is a preliminary evaluation of the feasibility of miscible flare gas injection based on phase behavior computations of a model oil (43%n-C5H12: 57%n-C16H34) and a model flare gas (91%CH4: 9%C2H6). The computations employed the multiple mixing-cell model with Peng-Robinson and PC-SAFT equations of state, and compared the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) value in the cases of flare gas injection and CO2 injection. For CO2 injection, both equations of state produced MMP values close to the measured value of 10.55 MPa. Flare gas injection MMP values were predicted to be 3.6-4.5 times those of CO2 injection. This very high MMP implies high gas compression costs, and may compromise the integrity of the reservoir. Subsequent studies shall explore the gas-oil miscibility behavior of mixtures of flare gas with intermediate hydrocarbon gases and CO2, in order to identify a suitable approach for rendering flare gas feasible as an injection gas in MGF-EOR. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - Disinfection process was applied as the last step of the water treatment to kill pathogenic bacteria in the water. However, according to several studies, the ozonation disinfection process could form undesired by-products. One of the by-products potentially affecting human life is bromate produced from bromide ionic-containing water. This study was carried out to examine the effect of raw water characteristics and pH on bromate formation. Also, the performance of bromate formation for a period of exposure time was analyzed. Raw waters taken from four different areas around Bandung were exposed to ozone introduced to a reactor with a flow rate of 2 L/min. The pH of the raw waters varied from 4, 7 to 10. The results show that there was no evidence of an initial bromide ion concentration, whereas a change in pH value gives a significantly different outcome. In acidic condition (pH of 4) the bromate formation tends to decrease, whereas when the pH value increases to a pH of 10, the bromate formation increases. Therefore, for drinking water with a neutral pH, when bromide ions are detected in the raw water, the drinking water may be toxic due to the presence of bromate. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - This paper describes a hardware architectural design of a real-time counter based entropy coder at a register transfer level (RTL) computing model. The architecture is based on a lossless compression algorithm called Rice coding, which is optimal for an entropy range of 1.5 < H < 2.5 bits per sample. The architecture incorporates a word-splitting scheme to extend the entropy coverage into a range of 1.5 < H < 7.5 bits per sample. We have designed a data structure in a form of independent code blocks, allowing more robust compressed bitstream. The design focuses on an RTL computing model and architecture, utilizing 8-bit buffers, adders, registers, loader-shifters, select-logics, down-counters, up-counters, and multiplexers. We have validated the architecture (both the encoder and the decoder) in a coprocessor for 8 bits/sample data on an FPGA Xilinx XC4005, utilizing 61% of F&G-CLBs, 34% H-CLBs, 32% FF-CLBs, and 68% IO resources. On this FPGA implementation, the encoder and decoder can achieve 1.74 Mbits/s and 2.91 Mbits/s throughputs, respectively. The architecture allows pipelining, resulting in potentially maximum encoding throughput of 200 Mbit/s on typical real-time TTL implementations. In addition, it uses a minimum number of register elements. As a result, this architecture can result in low cost, low energy consumption and reduced silicon area realizations. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - This paper proposes a new control design approach for industrial wastewater treatment where its logic control is verifiable. In this research, a treatment control design in a lab-scale was controlled by a microcontroller circuit. The developed system combined anaerobic digestion, aeration and filtration process. Its logic control algorithm was designed by using Signal Interpreted Petri Net. In the logic verification, six analysis properties were satisfied: conflict free (logical process had no conflict behavior), termination (the process could be terminated from any state), non-contradictory outputs, live (any process state could always be reached from other state), deadlock-free, and reversible (the process could always back to initial condition). In the design evaluation, the average value of transparency metrics was 0.984 close to 1 as the best value. The system performance was evaluated by pollutant removal efficiency. The highest removal efficiencies were obtained when each anaerobic and aeration treatment were performed for three days respectively and followed by filtration. Within this condition, the system obtained average removal efficiency 91.7% of Chemical Oxygen Demand and 95.4% of Total Suspended Solids. In terms of electricity consumption, the system needed only 1,857.6 Watt-hour for a batch treatment process. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - Retraction spring is a type of orthodontic apparatus that is used to move a tooth with respect to another by utilizing its spring back effect. It is made of metallic wire formed to individual orthodontic cases. A specific geometry results in a set of force system, consisting of forces and moments, that provides specific movement effect when it is pre-activated to the adjacent teeth. Currently, orthodontists select its geometry depending on their knowledge and experience. It is based on separate and less-than-comprehensive literatures that not all orthodontists have access to. It may result in inaccuracies in treating individual tooth retraction case. Engineering approach to estimating retraction spring structural behavior is proposed through analytical, numerical and empirical methods. Castigliano method is used as the analytical approach, whilst finite element method is used as the numerical approach. The two simulation approaches were compared to the experiments to obtain the best simulation model. The behavior of the simulation models agree well with those of experiments. Hence, the simulation models were used to simulate a large number of geometries to form database of structural behavior of retraction spring that could be used in the geometry selection by orthodontists. © 2011 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - Direct Torque Control (DTC) has gained popularity for development of advanced motor control due to its simplicity and offers fast instantaneous torque and flux controls. However, the conventional DTC which is based on hysteresis controller has major drawbacks, namely high torque ripple and variable inverter switching frequency. This paper presents an improved switching strategy for reducing flux and torque ripples in DTC of PMSM drives; wherein the torque hysteresis controller and the look-up table used in the conventional DTC are replaced with a constant frequency torque controller (CFTC) and an optimized look-up table, respectively. It can be shown that a constant switching frequency is established due to the use of the CFTC while the reduction of torque and flux ripples is achieved mainly because of the selection of optimized voltage vector (i.e. with an optimized look-up table). This paper also will explain the construction of DTC schemes implemented using MATLAB-Simulink blocks. Simulation results were shown that a significant reduction of flux and torque ripples which is about 90% can be achieved through the proposed DTC scheme. © 2011 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - The paper reports an experiment on classification using fully polarimetric SAR data. Many reports have been presented mentioning test sites in temperate regions utilizing polarimetric SAR data from airborne and/or spaceborne SAR sensors. However, few studies are dedicated to tropical region which highly dynamic land uses are observed. Using the AirSAR Sungai Wain fully polarimetric data, capability to extract features in coastal region has been demonstrated by an unsupervised classification technique fed by the Cloude-Pottier decomposition theorem.

AB  - A new voltage control method for single-phase full-bridge PWM inverters that having an output LC filter is proposed in this paper. The proposed voltage controller has a capability to realize a zero steadystate output voltage error with fast response. The zero steady-state output voltage error is achieved by using a controller that is derived by using the virtual LC resonant circuit. Fast response is obtained by using a virtual resistance that is connected in parallel with the filter capacitor. The validity of the proposed method is verified by experimental results.

AB  - This paper presents an improvement to dq-domain method of calculating electromagnetic transients. The proposed methodology works on dq-domain model for all components of the power system and during all time iterations. This is a new direction distinct from the old one where the network is invariably modeled in phase-domain. By modeling the network in dq-domain there is no more problem of interfacing machine to network as usually met in the existing method as machine is modeled invariably in dq-domain. Besides eliminating the time consuming transformation procedure between dq-domain to phase-domain or visa versa the new method is able now to fully exploit the infinite stability region of the trapezoidal rule of integration. The prediction/correction procedure of the conventional dq-domain method, which is notoriously known limiting the stability region, is no longer required. Comparing simulations using the new method and ATP, one of the conventional dq-domain version, show perfect conformity for small time step. For long time step while ATP is failing, the new method still converges accurately up to Nyquist's interval.

AB  - Analysis and minimization of output current ripple of multiphase carrier-based PWM inverters are presented in this paper. Analytical expression of rms value of output current ripple of multiphase PWM inverters as a function of the reference signal is first derived. Based on this expression, it is shown that a pure sinusoidal signal is the optimum reference signal that results in minimum output current ripple. Different to three-phase PWM inverters, injection of harmonics into the sinusoidal reference signal is neither necessary nor useful. The rms values of output current ripple of 5-, 7-, and 9-phase PWM inverters under various reference signals are compared. Experimental results are included to show the validity of the analysis method.

AB  - Cocoa is one of Indonesian-main plantation commodities. During the cocoa seed drying process, there are two types of waste that are cocoa pod and cocoa sweating. Since the organic compounds contained in cocoa sweating is high enough, it is possible to anaerobically treat this wastewater in order to recover either intermediate or end products. Preliminary study showed that the existence of H2 in the reactor would block acetic acid formation. Therefore, the aim of this current experiment was to decrease hydrogen partial pressure by flushing various nitrogen gas flow rate to shift the intermediate products during the cocoa sweating anaerobic treatment. The experiments were carried on a Circulating Bed Reactor (CBR) which contained organic compounds around 100,000 mg/l COD. Then, the reactor was flushed continuously with nitrogen gas as without flushing, 125 ml/min, 500 ml/min and 750 ml/min. The results show there was a possibility that the introduction of nitrogen gas into the reactor could shift the profile of the intermediate product formation. At lower nitrogen gas flow rate more ethanol was formed than acetate formation, although at higher nitrogen gas flow rate the formation of acetate was still low enough.

AB  - Standard Shewhart process control chart has been widely used, but it is not sensitive in detecting small shift. A number of alternatives have been proposed to improve the capability of control chart. The double sampling (DS) control chart is aimed at improving the capability to detect any small shift out-of control condition by observing the second sample without interruption. The capabilities of DS control chart were measured as the expected sample size (as a measure of inspection cost) or the control chart power (as a measure for customer risk). Optimization of these criteria is used to determine the control limits. In this paper, we optimize both producer and customer risks under a certain expected number of sample sizes as the constraint. Comparing the result to the previous procedure that only optimize customer risk, the proposed optimization procedure gives the same first control limit but smaller second control limits with higher value of control chart power.

AB  - This paper presents a reduced order model problem using reciprocal transformation and balanced truncation followed by low order controller design of infinite dimensional systems. The class of systems considered is that of an exponentially stable state linear systems (A,B,C), where operator A has a bounded inverse, and the operator B and C are of finite-rank and bounded. We can connect the system (A,B,C) with its reciprocal system via the solutions of the Lyapunov equations. The realization of the reciprocal system is reduced by balanced truncation. This result is further translated using reciprocal transformation as the reduced-order model for the systems (A,B,C). Then the low order controller is designed based on the reduced order model. The numerical examples are studied using simulations of Euler-Bernoulli beam to show the closed-loop performance.

AB  - The tolerance stacking problem arises in the context of assemblies from interchangeable parts because of the inability to produce or to join parts exactly according to nominal dimensions. Either the relevant part's dimension varies around some nominal values from part to part or the act of assembly that leads to variation. For example, as runner of Francis turbine is joined with turbine shaft via mechanical lock, there is not only variation in the diameter of runner and the concentricity between the runner hole and turbine shaft, but also the variation in concentricity between the outer parts of runner to runner hole. Thus, there is the possibility that the assembly of such interacting parts won't function or won't come together as planned. Research in this area has been conducted and 2 mini hydro Francis turbines (800 kW and 910 kW) have been designed and manufactured for San Sarino and Sawi Dago 2 in Central Sulawesi. Experiences in analyzing the tolerance stacks have been documented. In this paper it will be demonstrated how the requirements of assembling performance are derived to be the designed tolerances of each interacting component, such a way that the assembling would be functioning and come together as planned.

AB  - At normal service temperatures, wearing course asphalt mixtures may have ductile cracking. Aggregate gradation characteristic is important to avoid the premature cracking. The present study discusses a relationship between the characteristic of aggregate gradation and crack resistance of wearing course mixtures. Asphalt mixture specimens were prepared using different types of aggregate gradation. The Bailey method was employed in order to recognize the characteristic of aggregate gradations. Notched semi circular bending test was conducted to obtain the critical J integral (J c). The coarse aggregate (CA) ratio and the fine graded fine aggregate coarse (FG FA c) ratio defined by the Bailey method were introduced to recognize the effect of aggregate gradation type on J c. The result was decreasing the J c value with increasing the CA ratio and FG FA c ratio. Satisfying the current Bailey criterion on the CA ratio for stone mastic asphalt mixtures and setting FG FA c of fine graded HMA mixtures near 0.4 seem useful in order to obtain HMA mixtures with a high J c. The present study also discusses spherical aggregates assembly models as an aid to illustrate development of the aggregates interlocking, which influences to the cracking.

AB  - An assessment of recirculation flow in Jatiluhur reservoir is conducted based on two dimensions turbulent κ-ε model. The numerical model wasdeveloped using finite difference method where hydrodynamic equation was solved by the combination of Mc Cormack and splitting methods. The κ-ε equation is solved using quickest scheme in convection term, central scheme in diffusion term and Euler scheme in reaction term. The simulations were done for maximum incoming flow during the rainy season and the dry season. Model results are compared to field measurement from which it is found that rainy season scenario has shown better agreement. Maximum incoming flow released in the rainy season could generate a boundary layer greater average velocity and more recirculation flow than that in the dry season. Further development is required to get more accurate results for the case with less average velocity.

AB  - The synthesis of hydrogen from hydrocarbons through the steam reforming of methanol on Cu/ZnO/Al 2O 3 catalyst has been investigated. This process is assigned to be one of the promising alternatives for fuel cell hydrogen process source. Hydrogen synthesis from methanol can be carried out by means of methanol steam reforming which is a gas phase catalytic reaction between methanol and water. In this research, the Cu/ZnO/Al 2O 3 catalyst prepared by the dry impregnation was used. The specific surface area of catalyst was 194.69 m 2gram. The methanol steam reforming (SRM) reaction was carried out by means of the injection of gas mixture containing methanol and water with 1:1.2 mol ratio and 20-90 mL/minute feed flow rate to a fixed bed reactor loaded by 1 g of catalyst. The reaction temperature was 200-300 °C, and the reactor pressure was 1 atm. Preceding the reaction, catalyst was reduced in the H 2/N 2 mixture at 160 °C. This study shows that at 300 °C reaction temperature, methanol conversion reached 100% at 28 mL/minute gas flow rate. This conversion decreased significantly with the increase of gas flow rate. Meanwhile, the catalyst prepared for SRM was stable in 36 hours of operation at 260 °C. The catalyst exhibited a good stability although the reaction condition was shifted to a higher gas flow rate.

AB  - More general correlations between pressure drop and gas-solid flow variables are developed from the present experimental data. The correlation was modeled for a pneumatic conveying system in a vertical pipe. The transition boundary between dense and dilute regimes is constructed from the pressure drop correlations. The gas-solid particle flow variables are quantified by the gas Reynolds (Nref) and the solid Froude (Frp) numbers. The dense flow regime is indicated by the decrease of the pressure drop with the increase of the gas Reynolds number. In contrary, the dilute regime exhibits the increase of the pressure drop with the gas Reynolds number. The proposed correlations were built at the range of gas Reynolds number f from 360 to 500 and solid Froude number from 0,01 to 0,02.
