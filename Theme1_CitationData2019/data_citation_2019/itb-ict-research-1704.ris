AB  - Process-Based Fraud (PBF) is fraud enabled by process deviations that occur in business processes. Several studies have proposed PBF detection methods; however, false decisions are still often made because of cases with low deviation. Low deviation is caused by ambiguity in determining fraud attribute values and low frequency of occurrence. This paper proposes a method of detecting PBF with low deviation in order to correctly detect fraudulent cases. Firstly, the fraudulence attributes are established, then a fuzzy approach is utilized to weigh the importance of the fraud attributes. Further, multi-attribute decision making (MADM) is employed to obtain a PBF rating according to attribute values and attribute importance weights. Finally, a decision is made whether the deviation is fraudulent or not, based on the PBF rating. Experimental validation showed that the accuracy and false discovery rate of the method were 0.92 and 0.33, respectively. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In statistical machine learning approaches for question classification, efforts based on lexical feature space require high computation power and complex data structures. This is due to the large number of unique words (or high dimensionality). Choosing semantic features instead could significantly reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. This article describes the use of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for question classification based on semantic features to improve both the training and testing speeds compared to the benchmark Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Improvements have also been made to the head word extraction and word sense disambiguation processes. These have resulted in a higher accuracy (an increase of 0.2%) for the classification of coarse classes compared to the benchmark. For the fine classes, however, there is a 1.0% decrease in accuracy but is compensated by a significant increase in speed (92.1% on average). © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In this research, a triple-band bandpass filter (BPF) using a cascade tri section step impedance resonator (TSSIR), which can be operated at 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz, and 2,600 MHz simultaneously, was designed, fabricated and evaluated. Advanced Design System (ADS) was used to design and simulate the proposed BPF. The proposed BPF using cascade TSSIR was fabricated on an FR4 substrate with dielectric permittivity, substrate thickness and loss tangent at 4.3, 1.6 mm and 0.0017, respectively. The performance parameters of the proposed BPF were characterized by insertion loss, return loss, voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) and group delay. The performance results from the simulation were compared to those of the fabricated BPF. The results showed that the performances from both the simulated and the fabricated BPF satisfied the design specifications and were in close agreement with each other. Furthermore, the results indicated that the proposed BPF using cascade TSSIR performed better than a hairpin BPF with TSSIR. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Because of the facility of accessing and sharing digital images through the internet, digital images are often copied, edited and reused. Digital image watermarking is an approach to protect and manage digital images as intellectual property. The embedding of a natural watermark based on the properties of the human eye can be utilized to effectively hide a watermark image. This paper proposes a watermark embedding scheme based on the psychovisual threshold and edge entropy. The sensitivity of minor changes in DCT coefficients against JPEG quantization tables was investigated. A watermark embedding scheme was designed that offers good resistance against JPEG image compression. The proposed scheme was tested under different types of attacks. The experimental results indicated that the proposed scheme can achieve high imperceptibility and robustness against attacks. The watermark recovery process is also robust against attacks. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - With the expansion and acceptance of Word Wide Web, sentiment analysis has become progressively popular research area in information retrieval and web data analysis. Due to the huge amount of user-generated contents over blogs, forums, social media, etc., sentiment analysis has attracted researchers both in academia and industry, since it deals with the extraction of opinions and sentiments. In this paper, we have presented a review of topic modeling, especially LDA-based techniques, in sentiment analysis. We have presented a detailed analysis of diverse approaches and techniques, and compared the accuracy of different systems among them. The results of different approaches have been summarized, analyzed and presented in a sophisticated fashion. This is the really effort to explore different topic modeling techniques in the capacity of sentiment analysis and imparting a comprehensive comparison among them. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Javanese characters are traditional characters that are used to write the Javanese language. The Javanese language is a language used by many people on the island of Java, Indonesia. The use of Javanese characters is diminishing more and more because of the difficulty of studying the Javanese characters themselves. The Javanese character set consists of basic characters, numbers, complementary characters, and so on. In this research we have developed a system to recognize Javanese characters. Input for the system is a digital image containing several handwritten Javanese characters. Preprocessing and segmentation are performed on the input image to get each character. For each character, feature extraction is done using the ICZ-ZCZ method. The output from feature extraction will become input for an artificial neural network. We used several artificial neural networks, namely a bidirectional associative memory network, a counterpropagation network, an evolutionary network, a backpropagation network, and a backpropagation network combined with chi2. From the experimental results it can be seen that the combination of chi2 and backpropagation achieved better recognition accuracy than the other methods. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The intrusion detection system (IDS) is an important network security tool for securing computer and network systems. It is able to detect and monitor network traffic data. Snort IDS is an open-source network security tool. It can search and match rules with network traffic data in order to detect attacks, and generate an alert. However, the Snort IDS can detect only known attacks. Therefore, we have proposed a procedure for improving Snort IDS rules, based on the association rules data mining technique for detection of network probe attacks. We employed the MIT-DARPA 1999 data set for the experimental evaluation. Since behavior pattern traffic data are both normal and abnormal, the abnormal behavior data is detected by way of the Snort IDS. The experimental results showed that the proposed Snort IDS rules, based on data mining detection of network probe attacks, proved more efficient than the original Snort IDS rules, as well as icmp.rules and icmp-info.rules of Snort IDS. The suitable parameters for the proposed Snort IDS rules are defined as follows: Min_sup set to 10%, and Min_conf set to 100%, and through the application of eight variable attributes. As more suitable parameters are applied, higher accuracy is achieved. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Rapid identification of content structures in a scientific paper is of great importance particularly for those who actively engage in frontier research. This paper presents a multi-classifier approach to identify such structures in terms of classification of rhetorical sentences in scientific papers. The idea behind this approach is based on an observation that no single classifier is the best performer for classifying all rhetorical categories of sentences. Therefore, our approach learns which classifiers are good at what categories, assign the classifiers for those categories and apply only the right classifier for classifying a given category. This paper employsk-fold cross validation over training data to obtain the category-classifier mapping and then re-learn the classification model of the corresponding classifier using full training data on that particular category. This approach has been evaluated for identifying sixteen different rhetorical categories on sentences collected from ACL-ARC paper collection. The experimental results show that the multi-classifier approach can significantly improve the classification performance over multi-label classifiers. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The problem of spam e-mail has gained a tremendous amount of attention. Although entities tend to use e-mail spam filter applications to filter out received spam e-mails, marketing companies still tend to send unsolicited e-mails in bulk and users still receive a reasonable amount of spam e-mail despite those filtering applications. This work proposes a new method for classifying e-mails into spam and non-spam. First, several e-mail content features are extracted and then those features are used for classifying each e-mail individually. The classification results of three different classifiers (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forests and k-Nearest Neighbor) are combined in various voting schemes (i.e. majority vote, average probability, product of probabilities, minimum probability and maximum probability) for making the final decision. To validate our method, two different spam e-mail collections were used. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In the deployment scenario of multiple base stations there is usually a deficiency in the routing protocols for load balancing in the wireless network. In this study, we propose a routing algorithm that can be implemented inMobile Adhoc Networks (MANETs) as well as third-generation (3G)-Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) offload networks. We combined the Genetic Zone Routing Protocol (GZRP) with the Vertical Handover (VHO) algorithm in a 3G-WiFi offload network with multiple base stations. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm yields improvement in the received signal strength (which is increased up to 25 dBm), user throughput (which is approximately 1 Mbps-2.5 Mbps), and data rate (which is increased up to 2.5 Mbps). © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Volume is one of important issues in the production and processing of food product. Traditionally, volume measurement can be performed using water displacement method based on Archimedes' principle. Water displacement method is inaccurate and considered as destructive method. Computer vision offers an accurate and nondestructive method in measuring volume of food product. This paper proposes algorithm for volume measurement of irregular shape food product using computer vision based on Monte Carlo method. Five images of object were acquired from five different views and then processed to obtain the silhouettes of object. From the silhouettes of object, Monte Carlo method was performed to approximate the volume of object. The simulation result shows that the algorithm produced high accuracy and precision for volume measurement. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Introducing motion sensors into smartphones contributed to a wide range of applications in human-phone interaction, gaming, and many others. However, built-in sensors that detect subtle motion changes (e.g. accelerometers), might also reveal information about taps on touch screens: the main user input mode. Few researchers have already demonstrated the idea of exploiting motion sensors as side-channels into inferring keystrokes. Taken at most as initial explorations, much research is still needed to analyze the practicality of the new threat and examine various aspects of its implementation. One important aspect affecting directly the attack effectiveness is the selection of the right combination of sensors, to supply inference data. Although other aspects also play crucial role (e.g. the features set), we start in this paper by focusing on the comparison of different available sensors, in terms of the inference accuracy. We consider individual sensors shipped on Android phones, and study few options of preprocessing their raw datasets as well as fusing several sensors' readings. Our results indicate an outstanding performance of the gyroscope, and the potential of sensors data fusion. However, it seems that sensors with magnetometer component or the accelerometer alone have less benefit in the context of the adverted attack. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In this paper, characterization of log-periodic fractal Koch antenna in series iteration and equipped with balance-unbalance (balun) unit is investigated numerically and experimentally. The proposed antenna which is deployed an FR-4 Epoxy dielectric substrate using printed-antenna techniques is designed based on Koch fractal geometry in series iteration to minimize its transversal dimension. Since the proposed antenna is a balanced antenna type, then it requires a balun circuit to be available being fed from a coaxial type transmission line. Prior to realization and experimental characterization, some basic antenna parameters including VSWR, impedance characteristic, gain, and radiation pattern are investigated numerically to obtain the optimum architectural design. Moreover, the number of antenna elements as well as the effect of balun unit is also analyzed numerically. From the result, it shows that the proposed antenna has a dimension of 120mm x 150mm, working bandwidth from 0.7GHz-2.6GHz for VSWR < 2, and overall gain of more than 6dB for frequency range > 1.6GHz. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Countries with a tropical climate, such as Indonesia, are highly dependent on rainfall prediction for many sectors, such as agriculture, aviation, and shipping. Rainfall has now become increasingly unpredictable due to climate change and this phenomenon also affects Indonesia. Therefore, a robust approach is required for more accurate rainfall prediction. The Tsukamoto Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) is one of the algorithms that can be used for prediction problems, but if its membership functions are not specified properly, the prediction error is still high. To improve the results, the boundaries of the membership functions can be adjusted automatically by using a genetic algorithm. The proposed genetic algorithm employs two selection processes. The first one uses the Roulette wheel method to select parents, while the second one uses the elitism method to select chromosomes for the next generation. Based on this approach, a rainfall prediction experiment was conducted for Tengger, Indonesia using historical rainfall data for ten-year periods. The proposed method generated root mean square errors (RMSE) of 6.78 and 6.63 for the areas of Tosari and Tutur respectively. These results are better compared with the results using Tsukamoto FIS and the Generalized Space Time Autoregressive (GSTAR) model from previous studies. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Over the past decades, World Wide Web technology has developed greatly. One of the most important outcomes of this technology is to share data in a worldwide domain. A considerable amount of available data have spatial components and are hence called spatial data. The level of quality that spatial datasets conform plays an important role in their reliability for use in projects. This research aims to overview spatial data quality elements and select appropriate elements suitable for means of semi-automated quality evaluation. In this paper, the ISO 19100 series of standards for geographic information is used as basis for quality evaluation. The possibilities of use of different spatial data quality elements for semi-automated quality evaluation are explored and discussed. Finally, based on argumentation and reference to other research studies, a list of spatial data quality elements and sub-elements suitable for semi- automated quality evaluation of spatial datasets are presented. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Electrical capacitance volume tomography is a volumetric tomography technique that utilizes capacitance and fringing to capture behavior or perturbation in the sensing domain. One of the crucial issues in developing ECVT technology is the reconstruction algorithm. In practice, ILBP is most used due to its simplicity. However, it still presents elongation errors for certain dielectric contrasts. The high undersampling measurement of the ECVT imaging system, which is mathematically defined as an undetermined linear system, is one of the most challenging issues. Compressive sensing (CS) is a framework that enables the recovery of a sparse signal or a signal that can be represented as sparse in a certain domain, by having a lower dimension of measurement data compared to the Shanon-Nyquist theorem. Thus, mathematically, this framework is promising for solving an undetermined linear system such as the ECVT imaging system. This paper discusses the possibility of developing an ECVT imaging technique for static objects based on a CS framework. Based on the simulation results, Non-optimized CS does not completely succeed in providing better ECVT imaging quality. However, it does provide more localized imaging compared to ILBP. In addition, by having fewer requirements for the measurement data dimension, the CS framework is promising for reducing the number of required electrodes. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - High utility itemset mining (HUIM) plays an important role in the data mining community and in a wide range of applications. For example, in retail business it is used for finding sets of sold products that give high profit, low cost, etc. These itemsets can help improve marketing strategies, make promotions/ advertisements, etc. However, since HUIM only considers utility values of items/itemsets, it may not be sufficient to observe product-buying behavior of customers such as information related to “regular purchases of sets of products having a high profit margin”. To address this issue, the occurrence behavior of itemsets (in the term of regularity) simultaneously with their utility values was investigated. Then, the problem of mining high utility itemsets with regular occurrence (MHUIR) to find sets of co-occurrence items with high utility values and regular occurrence in a database was considered. An efficient single-pass algorithm, called MHUIRA, was introduced. A new modified utility-list structure, called NUL, was designed to efficiently maintain utility values and occurrence information and to increase the efficiency of computing the utility of itemsets. Experimental studies on real and synthetic datasets and complexity analyses are provided to show the efficiency of MHUIRA combined with NUL in terms of time and space usage for mining interesting itemsets based on regularity and utility constraints. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The over increasing demand for deployment of wireless access networks has made wireless mobile devices to face so many challenges in choosing the best suitable network from a set of available access networks. Some of the weighty issues in 4G wireless networks are fastness and seamlessness in handover process. This paper therefore, proposes a handover technique based on movement prediction in wireless mobile (WiMAX and LTE-A) environment. The technique enables the system to predict signal quality between the UE and Radio Base Stations (RBS)/Access Points (APs) in two different networks. Prediction is achieved by employing the Markov Decision Process Model (MDPM) where the movement of the UE is dynamically estimated and averaged to keep track of the signal strength of mobile users. With the help of the prediction, layer-3 handover activities are able to occur prior to layer-2 handover, and therefore, total handover latency can be reduced. The performances of various handover approaches influenced by different metrics (mobility velocities) were evaluated. The results presented demonstrate good accuracy the proposed method was able to achieve in predicting the next signal level by reducing the total handover latency. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Cloud storage has emerged as a popular paradigm to outsource data to third party and share it with the collaborators. While this new paradigm enables users to outsource their sensitive data and reduces data management costs, it brings forth the new challenges to the user to keep their data secure. Data storage security and access control in the cloud is one of the challenging ongoing research works to alleviate the data leakage problem from unauthorized users. Existing solutions that use pure cryptographic techniques suffers from heavy computation work with respect to key management and key distribution. Attribute based encryption is an alternative solution that map the user access structure with the data file attributes to control the data access. However any of the existing schemes doesn't address the access control with assured deletion of the files upon revocation of user access. This article addresses this open issue using a trusted authority that manages the access control list and takes care of key management and key distribution and file deletion upon user revocation. The prototype of model has been presented and analyzed the security features over existing scheme. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In this paper, the problem of subcarrier allocation on chunk-by-chunk basis in SC-FDMA uplink systems is investigated. Improved mean enhanced greedy algorithms are proposed for performing joint-user and chunk-based allocation at each transmission time interval. Selection criteria based on spectral efficiency and fairness are also proposed to choose the final allocation at each transmission time interval. Simulation results show that when the number of users and the velocity of the users were varied, the improved algorithms that use selection criteria based on spectral efficiency and fairness could outperform the existing mean greedy algorithms that employ user-based allocation in terms of spectral efficiency and fairness. Moreover, the improved algorithms not only showed better performance but also had the same time complexity as the existing mean greedy algorithms. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In this paper we propose a new approach to path planning for mobile robots with cellular automata and cellular learning automata. We divide the planning into two stages. In the first stage, global path planning is performed by cellular automata from an initial position to a goal position. In this stage, the minimum distance is computed. To compute the path, we use a particular two-dimensional cellular automata rule. The process of computation is performed using simple arithmetic operations, hence it can be done efficiently. In the second stage, local planning is used to update the global path. This stage is required to adapt to changes in a dynamic environment. This planning is implemented using cellular learning automata to optimize performance by collecting information from the environment. This approach yields a path that stays near to the obstacles and therefore the total time and distance to the goal can be optimized. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Assessing the achievement of Indonesian government institutions in implementing e-government has been conducted since around a decade ago. Several national assessments are available with almost the same ranking results. There is an agreement that the ultimate goal of e-government implementation is to achieve good government governance (GGG), while success stories of e-government require good governance practices. This study explored the correlation between e-government achievement and GGG achievement in Indonesia. Spearman’s rank correlation was used to characterize the relationship strength between e-government assessment results and good governance assessment results. The data were collected from institutions that participated in e-government and good governance assessments. The results showed that the correlation between these two entities is not very strong. Most cases showed that e-government implementation and the achievement of good governance have only a moderate positive correlation and none of the studied cases indicated a significant connection. This result can be attributed to the lack of emphasis on goals achievement in the assessments. Thus, it is recommended that future Indonesian e-government assessments should involve impact indicators. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - An automated search with human involvement consisting of two stages is given detailed consideration in this paper. In the first stage, a search without direct human involvement is implemented. In the second stage, the search assumes human involvement. Evaluations of the search operations’ effectiveness are presented. These operations are implemented for searching one object exclusively among a variety of similar objects. The average number of similar objects recommended for further analysis was used as effectiveness indicator. A set of numerical evaluation criteria for search effectiveness is introduced. The basis of the search block is a pattern recognition algorithm characterized by two probabilities: 1) probability of missing a target, and 2) false alarm probability. An analytical model of the search block was developed. In this paper particular attention is given to the average length of the recommendatory list as an effectiveness indicator. Four properties of this indicator were determined. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Skeletonization "also known as thinning" is an important step in the pre-processing phase in many of pattern recognition techniques. The output of Skeletonization process is the skeleton of the pattern in the images. Skeletonization is a crucial process for many applications such as OCR and writer identification. However, the improvements in this area are only a recent phenomenon and still require more researches. In this paper, a new skeletonization algorithm is proposed. This algorithm combines between parallel and sequential, which is categorized under an iterative approach. The suggested method is conducted by experiments of benchmark dataset for evaluation. The outcome is to obtain much better results compared to other thinning methods that are discussed in comparison part. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Training an artificial neural network is an optimization task, since it is desired to find optimal weight sets for a neural network during training process. Traditional training algorithms such as back propagation have some drawbacks such as getting stuck in local minima and slow speed of convergence. This study combines the best features of two algorithms; i.e. Levenberg Marquardt back propagation (LMBP) and Cuckoo Search (CS) for improving the convergence speed of artificial neural networks (ANN) training. The proposed CSLM algorithm is trained on XOR and OR datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed CSLM algorithm has better performance than other similar hybrid variants used in this study. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Social media are a powerful communication tool in our era of digital information. The large amount of user-generated data is a useful novel source of data, even though it is not easy to extract the treasures from this vast and noisy trove. Since classification is an important part of text mining, many techniques have been proposed to classify this kind of information. We developed an effective technique of social media text classification by semi-supervised learning utilizing an online news source consisting of well-formed text. The computer first automatically extracts news categories, well-categorized by publishers, as classes for topic classification. A bag of words taken from news articles provides the initial keywords related to their category in the form of word vectors. The principal task is to retrieve a set of new productive keywords. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency weighting (TF-IDF) and Word Article Matrix (WAM) are used as main methods. A modification of WAM is recomputed until it becomes the most effective model for social media text classification. The key success factor was enhancing our model with effective keywords from social media. A promising result of 99.50% accuracy was achieved, with more than 98.5% of Precision, Recall, and F-measure after updating the model three times. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - To guarantee the phenomenon of “Always Best Connection” in heterogeneous wireless networks, a vertical handover optimization is necessary to realize seamless mobility. Received signal strength (RSS) from the user equipment (UE) contains interference from surrounding base stations, which happens to be a function of the network load of the nearby cells. An expression is derived for the received SINR (signal to interference and noise ratio) as a function of traffic load in interfering cells of data networks. A better estimate of the UE SINR is achieved by taking into account the contribution of inter-cell interference. The proposed scheme affords UE to receive high throughput with less data rate, and hence benefits users who are located far from the base station. The proposed scheme demonstrates an improved throughput between the servingbase station and the cell boundary. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Information systems development (ISD) projects are highly complex, with different groups of people having to collaborate and exchange their knowledge. Considering the intensity of knowledge exchange that takes place in outsourced ISD projects, in this study a conceptual model was developed, aiming to examine the influence of four antecedents, i.e. standardization, requirement volatility, internal integration, and external integration, on two dependent variables, i.e. process performance and product performance. Data were collected from 46 software companies in four big cities in Indonesia. The collected data were examined to verify the proposed theoretical model using the partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. The results show that process performance is significantly influenced by internal integration and standardization, while product performance is significantly influenced by external integration and requirement volatility. This study contributes to a better understanding of how knowledge integration can be managed in outsourced ISD projects in view of increasing their success. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Intrusion detection systems (IDS) play an important role in information security. Two major problems in the development of IDSs are the computational aspect and the architectural aspect. The computational or algorithmic problems include lacking ability of novel-attack detection and computation overload caused by large data traffic. The architectural problems are related to the communication between components of detection, including difficulties to overcome distributed and coordinated attacks because of the need of large amounts of distributed information and synchronization between detection components. This paper proposes a multi-agent architecture for a distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS) based on ant-colony clustering (ACC), for recognizing new and coordinated attacks, handling large data traffic, synchronization, co-operation between components without the presence of centralized computation, and good detection performance in real-time with immediate alarm notification. Feature selection based on principal component analysis (PCA) is used for dimensional reduction of NSL-KDD. Initial features are transformed to new features in smaller dimensions, where probing attacks (Ra-Probe) have a characteristic sign in their average value that is different from that of normal activity. Selection is based on the characteristics of these factors, resulting in a two-dimensional subset of the 75% data reduction. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The precise conversion of arbitrary text into its corresponding phoneme sequence (grapheme-to-phoneme or G2P conversion) is implemented in speech synthesis and recognition, pronunciation learning software, spoken term detection and spoken document retrieval systems. Because the quality of this module plays an important role in the performance of such systems and many problems regarding G2P conversion have been reported, we propose a novel two-stage model-based approach, which is implemented using an existing weighted finite-state transducer-based G2P conversion framework, to improve the performance of the G2P conversion model. The first-stage model is built for automatic conversion of words to phonemes, while the second-stage model utilizes the input graphemes and output phonemes obtained from the first stage to determine the best final output phoneme sequence. Additionally, we designed new grapheme generation rules, which enable extra detail for the vowel and consonant graphemes appearing within a word. When compared with previous approaches, the evaluation results indicate that our approach using rules focusing on the vowel graphemes slightly improved the accuracy of the out-of-vocabulary dataset and consistently increased the accuracy of the in-vocabulary dataset. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper discusses the usage of the short-term energy contour of speech smoothed by a fuzzy-based method to automatically segment it into syllabic units. Two new additional procedures, local normalization and postprocessing, are proposed to adapt to the Indonesian language. Testing to 220 Indonesian utterances showed that the local normalization significantly improved the performance of the fuzzy-based smoothing. In the postprocessing procedure, splitting and assimilation work in different ways. The splitting of missed short syllables sharply reduced deletion, but slightly increased insertion. On the other hand, the assimilation of a single consonant segment into an expected previous or next segment slightly reduced insertion, but increased deletion. The use of splitting gave a higher accuracy than the assimilation and combined splittingassimilation procedures, since in many cases the assimilation keeps the unexpected insertions and overmerges the expected segments. © 2014, Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper presents a method to predict performance of multiple processor cores in a reconfigurable system for embedded applications. A multiprocessor framework is developed with the capability of reconfigurable processors in a shared memory system optimized for stream-oriented data and signal processing applications. The framework features a discrete time Markov based stochastic tool, which is used to analyze memory contention in the shared memory architecture, and to predict the performance increase (speed of execution) when the number of processors is varied. Performance predictions for variations of other system parameters, such as different task allocations and the number of pipeline stages are possible as well. The results of the prediction tool were verified by experimental results of a green screen application developed and run on a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA with MicroBlaze soft processors. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Text normalization is an important technique in document image analysis and recognition. It consists of many preprocessing stages, which include slope correction, text padding, skew correction, and straight the writing line. In this side, text normalization has an important role in many procedures such as text segmentation, feature extraction and characters recognition. In the present article, a new method for text baseline detection, straightening, and slant correction for Arabic handwritten texts is proposed. The method comprises a set of sequential steps: first components segmentation is done followed by components text thinning; then, the direction features of the skeletons are extracted, and the candidate baseline regions are determined. After that, selection of the correct baseline region is done, and finally, the baselines of all components are aligned with the writing line. The experiments are conducted on IFN/ENIT benchmark Arabic dataset. The results show that the proposed method has a promising and encouraging performance. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Recently, increasing battery lifetime in wireless sensor networks has turned out to be one of the major challenges faced by researchers. The sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks use a battery as their power source, which is hard to replace during deployment. Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) is one of the most prominent wireless sensor network routing protocols that have been proposed to improve network lifetime by utilizing energy-efficient clustering. However, LEACH has some issues related to cluster-head selection, where the selection is done randomly. This leads to rapid loss of energy in the network. Improved LEACH is a LEACH alternative that has the ability to increase network lifetime by using the nodes’ residual energy and their distance to the base station to select cluster-head nodes. However, Improved LEACH causes reduced stability, where the stability period is the duration before the death of the first node. The network stability period is important for applications that require reliable feedback from the network. Thus, we were motivated to investigate the Improved LEACH algorithm and to try to solve the stability problem. A new protocol is proposed in this paper: Stable Improved Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (SILEACH), which was developed to overcome the flaws of the Improved LEACH protocol. SILEACH balances the load between the nodes by utilizing an optimized method that considers the nodes’ distance to the base station and their residual energy to select the cluster-head nodes and considers the nodes’ distance to the cluster head and the base station to form clusters. The simulation results revealed that SILEACH is significantly more efficient than Improved LEACH in terms of stability period and network lifetime. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The growth of the number of textual documents in the digital world, especially on the World Wide Web, is incredibly fast. This causes an accumulation of information, so we need efficient organization to manage textual documents. One way to accurately classify documents is using fuzzy association rules. The quality of the document clustering is affected by phase extraction of key terms and type of fuzzy logic system (FLS) used for clustering. The use of meronyms in the extraction of key terms to obtain cluster labels helps obtaining meaningful cluster labels and in addition ambiguities and uncertainties that occur in the rules of type-1 fuzzy logic systems can be overcome by using type-2 fuzzy sets. This study proposes a method of key term extraction based on meronyms with an initialization cluster using fuzzy association rule mining for document clustering. This method consists of four stages, i.e. preprocessing of the document, extraction of key terms with meronyms, extraction of candidate clusters, and cluster tree construction. Testing of this method was done with three different datasets: classic, Reuters, and 20 Newsgroup. Testing was done by comparing the overall F-measure of the method without meronyms and with meronyms. Based on the testing, the method with meronyms in the extraction of keywords produced an overall F-measure of 0.5753 for the classic dataset, 0.3984 for the Reuters dataset, and 0.6285 for the 20 Newsgroup dataset. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In this study, a robust method is proposed for accurately separating overlapping cell nuclei in cervical microscopic images. This method is based on watershed transformation and an elliptical approach. Since the watershed transformation process of taking the initial seed is done manually, the method was developed to obtain the initial seed automatically. Total initial seeds at this stage represents the number of nuclei that exist in the image of a pap smear, either overlapping or not. Furthermore, a method was developed based on an elliptical approach to obtain the area of each of the nuclei automatically. This method can successfully separate several (more than two) clustered cell nuclei. In addition, the proposed method was evaluated by experts and was proven to have better results than methods from previous studies in terms of accuracy and execution time. The proposed method can determine overlapping and nonoverlapping boundaries of nuclei fast and accurately. The proposed method provides better decision-making on areas with overlapping nuclei and can help to improve the accuracy of image analysis and avoid information loss during the process of image segmentation. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Regression test case prioritization is used to improve certain performance goals. Limited resources force to choose an effective prioritization technique, which makes an ordering of the test cases so that the most suitable test case will be executed first. Executing regression test cases for a fixed time is all about time aware test case prioritization. Regression test case prioritization using chemical reaction optimization (CRO) for object-oriented programs is proposed in this paper. The effectiveness of the test case ordering was measured using average percentage of faults detected (APFD). Experiments on three objectoriented subject programs involving three different techniques were performed to judge the proposed approach. The empirical results indicate that the algorithm implemented using CRO gives a higher APFD value than the other two techniques. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The downlink communication channel from high-altitude platform (HAP) to high-speed train (HST) in the Ka-band is a slowly time-varying Rician distributed flat fading channel with 10-25 dB Rician K factor. In this respect, the received signal is mainly affected by the Doppler shift of the line-of-sight (LOS) link. In order to increase receiver performance, we propose to firstly compensate the Doppler shift of the received signal before least-squares (LS) adaptive filtering is pursued. Implementing the proposed method requires a priori knowledge of the time-varying phase of the LOS component. This is justified since signalling between the train and the controller exists such that the train velocity and location are predictable. Implementing the proposed method to the recursive LS (RLS) received beamforming algorithm shows reduction of mean square error (MSE) and bit error rate (BER). © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In wireless sensor networks, clustering provides an effective way of organising the sensor nodes to achieve load balancing and increasing the lifetime of the network. Unequal clustering is an extension of common clustering that exhibits even better load balancing. Most existing approaches do not consider node density when clustering, which can pose significant problems. In this paper, a fuzzy-logic based cluster head selection approach is proposed, which considers the residual energy, centrality and density of the nodes. In addition, a fuzzy-logic based clustering range assignment approach is used, which considers the suitability and the position of the nodes in assigning the clustering range. Furthermore, a weight function is used to optimize the selection of the relay nodes. The proposed approach was compared with a number of well known approaches by simulation. The results showed that the proposed approach performs better than the other algorithms in terms of lifetime and other metrics. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Reliable and efficient data broadcasting is essential in vehicular networks to provide safety-critical and commercial service messages on the road. There is still no comprehensive analysis of IEEE 802.11p based MAC that portrays the presence of buffer memory in vehicular networks. Besides, most of the analytical works do not fulfill some of the IEEE 802.11p specifications, such as short retry limit and back-off timer freezing. This paper proposes a 1-D and 2-D Markov model to analyze mathematically IEEE 802.11p based MAC for safety and non-safety messages respectively. The work presented in this paper takes into account the traffic arrival along with the first-order buffer memory and freezing of the back-off timer as well, to utilize the channel efficiently and provide higher accuracy in estimation of channel access, yielding more precise results of the system throughput for non-safety messages and lower delay for safety messages. Furthermore, back-off stages with a short retry limit were applied for non-safety messages in order to meet the IEEE 802.11p specifications, guaranteeing that no packet is served indefinitely, avoiding the overestimation of system throughput. A simulation was carried out to validate the analytical results of our model. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Target market classification is aimed at focusing marketing activities on the right targets. Classification of target markets can be done through data mining and by utilizing data from social media, e.g. Twitter. The end result of data mining are learning models that can classify new data. Ensemble methods can improve the accuracy of the models and therefore provide better results. In this study, classification of target markets was conducted on a dataset of 3000 tweets in order to extract features. Classification models were constructed to manipulate the training data using two ensemble methods (bagging and boosting). To investigate the effectiveness of the ensemble methods, this study used the CART (classification and regression tree) algorithm for comparison. Three categories of consumer goods (computers, mobile phones and cameras) and three categories of sentiments (positive, negative and neutral) were classified towards three target-market categories. Machine learning was performed using Weka 3.6.9. The results of the test data showed that the bagging method improved the accuracy of CART with 1.9% (to 85.20%). On the other hand, for sentiment classification, the ensemble methods were not successful in increasing the accuracy of CART. The results of this study may be taken into consideration by companies who approach their customers through social media, especially Twitter. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Perfectly segmenting the area of the iris is one of the most important steps in iris recognition. There are several problematic areas that affect the accuracy of the iris segmentation step, such as eyelids, eyelashes, glasses, pupil (due to less accurate iris segmentation), motion blur, and lighting and specular reflections. To solve these problems, gradient magnitude and Fourier descriptor are employed to do iris segmentation in the proposed Multimodal Biometric Authentication System (MBAS). This approach showed quite promising results, i.e. an accuracy rate of 97%. The result of the iris recognition system was combined with the result of an open-source fingerprint recognition system to develop a multimodal biometrics authentication system. The results of the fusion between iris and fingerprint authentication were 99% accurate. Data from Multimedia Malaysia University (MMUI) and our own prepared database, the SGU-MB-1 dataset, were used to test the accuracy of the proposed system. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Convolutional encoding and data decoding are fundamental processes in convolutional error correction. One of the most popular error correction methods in decoding is the Viterbi algorithm. It is extensively implemented in many digital communication applications. Its VLSI design challenges are about area, speed, power, complexity and configurability. In this research, we specifically propose a VLSI architecture for a configurable and low-complexity design of a hard-decision Viterbi decoding algorithm. The configurable and low-complexity design is achieved by designing a generic VLSI architecture, optimizing each processing element (PE) at the logical operation level and designing a conditional adapter. The proposed design can be configured for any predefined number of trace-backs, only by changing the trace-back parameter value. Its computational process only needs N + 2 clock cycles latency, with N is the number of trace-backs. Its configurability function has been proven for N = 8, N = 16, N = 32 and N = 64. Furthermore, the proposed design was synthesized and evaluated in Xilinx and Altera FPGA target boards for area consumption and speed performance. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Rhetorical sentence classification is an interesting approach for making extractive summaries but this technique still needs to be developed because the performance of automatic rhetorical sentence classification is still poor. Rhetorical sentences are sentences that contain rhetorical words or phrases. Rhetorical sentences not only appear in the contents of a paper but also in the title. In this study, features related to section class and title class that have been proposed in a previous research were further developed. Our method uses different techniques to reach automatic section class extraction for which we introduce new, format-based features. Furthermore, we propose automatic rhetoric phrase extraction from the title. The corpus we used was a collection of technical-experimental scientific papers. Our method uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and the Naïve Bayesian algorithm for classification. The four categories used were: Problem, Method, Data, and Result. It was hypothesized that these features would be able to improve classification accuracy compared to previous methods. The F-measure for these categories reached up to 14%. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Wavelet-based image compression algorithms have good performance and produce a rate scalable bitstream that can be decoded efficiently at several bit rates. Unfortunately, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has relatively high computational complexity. On the other hand, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) has low complexity and excellent compaction properties. Unfortunately, it is non-local, which necessitates implementing it as a block-based transform leading to the well-known blocking artifacts at the edges of the DCT blocks. This paper proposes a very fast and rate scalable algorithm that exploits the low complexity of DCT and the low complexity of the set partitioning technique used by the wavelet-based algorithms. Like JPEG, the proposed algorithm first transforms the image using block-based DCT. Then, it rearranges the DCT coefficients into a wavelet-like structure. Finally, the rearranged image is coded using a modified version of the SPECK algorithm, which is one of the best wellknown wavelet-based algorithms. The modified SPECK consumes slightly less computer memory, has slightly lower complexity and slightly better performance than the original SPECK. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm has competitive performance and high processing speed. Consequently, it has the best performance to complexity ratio among all the current rate scalable algorithms. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The personal area network (PAN) coordinator can assign a guaranteed time slot (GTS) to allocate a particular duration for requested devices in IEEE 802.15.4 beacon-enabled mode. The main challenge in the GTS mechanism is how to let the PAN coordinator allocate time slot duration for the devices which request a GTS. If the allocated devices use the GTS partially or the traffic pattern is not suitable, wasted bandwidth will increase, which degrades the performance of the network. In order to overcome the abovementioned problem, this paper proposes the Partitioned GTS Allocation Scheme (PEGAS) for IEEE 802.15.4 networks. PEGAS aims to decide the precise moment for the starting time, the end, and the length of the GTS allocation for requested devices taking into account the values of the superframe order, superframe duration, data packet length, and arrival data packet rate. Our simulation results showed that the proposed mechanism outperforms the IEEE 802.15.4 standard in terms of the total number of transmitted packets, throughput, energy efficiency, latency, bandwidth utilization, and contention access period (CAP) length ratio. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In the last few years, several studies addressed the problem of data security in Mifare Classic. One of its weaknesses is the low random number quality. This causes SAT solver attacks to have lower complexity. In order to strengthen Crypto-1 against SAT solver attacks, a modification of the feedback function with better cryptographic properties is proposed. It applies a primitive polynomial companion matrix. SAT solvers cannot directly attack the feedback shift register that uses the modified Boolean feedback function, the register has to be split into smaller groups. Experimental testing showed that the amount of memory and CPU time needed were highest when attacking the modified Crypto-1 using the modified feedback function and the original filter function. In addition, another modified Crypto-1, using the modified feedback function and a modified filter function, had the lowest percentage of revealed variables. It can be concluded that the security strength and performance of the modified Crypto- 1 using the modified feedback function and the modified filter function are better than those of the original Crypto-1. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This study proposes a new set of moment functions for describing gray-level and color images based on the associated Laguerre polynomials, which are orthogonal over the whole right-half plane. Moreover, the mathematical frameworks of radial associated Laguerre moments (RALMs) and associated rotation invariants are introduced. The proposed radial Laguerre invariants retain the basic form of disc-based moments, such as Zernike moments (ZMs), pseudo-Zernike moments (PZMs), Fourier-Mellin moments (OFMMs), and so on. Therefore, the rotation invariants of RALMs can be easily obtained. In addition, the study extends the proposed moments and invariants defined in a gray-level image to a color image using the algebra of quaternion to avoid losing some significant color information. Finally, the paper verifies the feature description capacities of the proposed moment function in terms of image reconstruction and invariant pattern recognition accuracy. Experimental results confirmed that the associated Laguerre moments (ALMs) perform better than orthogonal OFMMs in both noise-free and noisy conditions. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The importance of technology, especially information technology (IT), to business is widely accepted. But, different from large enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)– with their limited resources –adopt IT slowly.The literature on technology adoption suggests that organizational readiness is one of many factors that determine the adoption of technology. This paper relates IT adoption in Indonesian B-to-B manufacturing SMEs with their IT readiness, which is represented by the owner’s support and the IT sophistication they have. In this paper, the variety of IT adoption by SMEs is explored using a business process approach. Owner’s support is represented byIT knowledge of the owners and resource allocation by the owners. IT sophistication includes the management level that is supported by IT, IT skills and IT innovativeness of the SMEs’ staffs. Three propositions were formulated and explored using data that were collected from 320 SMEs. Using cluster analysis, these SMEs were grouped into five types of IT adoption based on three business sides(supplier, internal and customer): early adoption, internal focus adoption, customer focus adoption, internal-customer focus adoption and balanced adoption. The results suggest that a wider IT adoption requires a greater support from the owner and a higher IT sophistication. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper modifies the Adaptive Contrast Enhancement Algorithm with Details Preserving (ACEDP) technique by integrating a fuzzy element in the image type selection. The proposed technique, named the Adaptive Fuzzy Contrast Enhancement with Details Preserving (AFCEDP) technique, first computes the degree of membership of the input image to three categories, i.e. low-, middle- or high-level images. The AFCEDP technique then clips the histogram at different plateau limits that are computed from both the degree of membership and the clipping functions. The classification of an image in the ACEDP technique is done based solely on the intensity range of the maximum number of pixels, which may be inaccurate. In the proposed AFCEDP technique, the image type classification is handled in a better way with the integration of a fuzzy element. The performance of the proposed AFCEDP technique was compared with the conventional ACEDP technique and several state-of-art techniques described in the literature. The simulation results revealed that the AFCEDP technique demonstrates good capability in contrast enhancement and detail preservation. In addition, the experiments using cervical cell images and HEp-2 cell images showed great potential of the AFCEDP technique as a technique for enhancing medical microscopic images. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a self-configuring infrastructure-less network of mobile devices connected by wireless links where each node or mobile device is independent to move in any desired direction and thus the links keep moving from one node to another. In such a network, the mobile nodes are equipped with CSMA/CA (carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance) transceivers and communicate with each other via radio. In MANETs, routing is considered one of the most difficult and challenging tasks. Because of this, most studies on MANETs have focused on comparing protocols under varying network conditions. But to the best of our knowledge no one has studied the effect of other factors on network performance indicators like throughput, jitter and so on, revealing how much influence a particular factor or group of factors has on each network performance indicator. Thus, in this study the effects of three key factors, i.e. routing protocol, packet size and DSSS rate, were evaluated on key network performance metrics, i.e. average delay and average jitter, as these parameters are crucial for network performance and directly affect the buffering requirements for all video devices and downstream networks. © 2014, Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Integrating sensor networks into the Internet brings many advantages. For example, users can monitor or control the state of the sensors remotely without visiting the field. Some researchers have proposed methods using a REST-based web service or HTTP to establish communication between sensors and server via the Internet. Unfortunately, as we know, HTTP is a best-effort service. In some cases this means that if the number of sensors increases the end-to-end Quality of Service will decrease. The end-to-end network delay increases, as well as the failure rate of data sending caused by HTTP timeouts. In this paper, we propose Finite Time Response (FTR) HTTP as a communication protocol suitable for integrating sensor networks into the Internet. We have defined a cross-layer approach that coordinates between the application layer and the physical layer to control not only performance but also energy efficiency. The HTTP request-response delay measured at the application layer is used as the decision factor at the physical layer to control the active and sleep periods. We also propose a forced-sleep period as a control mechanism to guarantee average performance for all nodes. The experimental results have shown that FTR has the ability to maintain better performance, indicated by a lower average response time and a lower average timeout experience. Optimization is still needed to gain better performance and better energy efficiency while also considering the average value of the update time. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Quadrangle and line tracking are essential for many real world applications of computer vision. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient line tracker that can robustly and accurately track lines in an image. We use a multiple-model-Kalman filter (MMKF) scheme, which can handle line tracking accurately and robustly. The basic idea is to run N multiple sub-Kalman filters in parallel. Each filter is configured to use a different state transition model. All the filters are updated by the measurement at the same time following the conventional Kalman filter update process. The final prediction is a combination of outputs from all the Kalman filter modules. After lines are detected, we developed a scheme to merge the lines together to become suitable quadrangles. The experimental result shows that the proposed system can track lines and quadrangle robustly in real time. The result is useful in shape detection and should be suitable for building many mobile projector applications. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - One of the major challenges due to spectrum scarcity in modern wireless communication is on antenna design that can serve a non-contagious frequency spectrum. In this paper, wideband and multiband design approaches are proposed to produce antennas that can serve various wireless technologies using different frequencies from 2.3 to 6.0 GHz, covering WiFi frequencies at 2.4-2.48 GHz, 5,15-5,35 GHz and 5,725-5,825 GHz, as well as WiMax frequencies at 2.3-2.4 GHz, 2.495-2.695 GHz, 3.3-3.8 GHz, and 5.25-5.85 GHz. The wideband and multiband antenna were implemented on an 0.8 mm thick of FR4 epoxy dielectric substrate with permittivity εr="4".3. The return loss of 10 dB can be achieved for 2.3 to 6 GHz in wideband antenna, and a tripe band of 2.3-2.8 GHz, 3.3-3.7 GHz, and above 4.6 GHz in multiband antenna. The gain of both antennas increases almost linearly from 0 dB at 2.3 GHz to around 4.5 dB at 6 GHz, except for the stop band at 2.8-3.3 GHz which has a significant drop of gain, corresponding to the stop frequency band. Antenna radiation pattern is bidirectional at x-y plane and nearly omnidirectional at y-z plane, and shows a similar patern for both wideband and multiband design approaches. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) draw the attention of researchers due to the diversity of applications that use them. Basically, a WSN comprises many sensor nodes that are supplied with power by means of a small battery installed in the node itself; the node can also be self-charged by a solar cell. Sometimes it is impossible to change the power supply of battery-operated nodes. This dictates that sensor nodes must utilize the energy they have in an optimal manner. Data communication is the main cause of energy dissipation. In this context, designing protocols for WSNs demands more attention to the design of energy-efficient routing protocols that allow communications between sensor nodes and their base station (BS) with the least cost. LEACH is a prominent hierarchical cluster-based routing protocol. It groups sensor nodes into clusters to reduce energy dissipation. On the other hand, LEACH-C is a protocol based on LEACH that claims to improve energy dissipation over LEACH. In this paper, a successful attempt was made to compare these two protocols using MATLAB. The results show that LEACH-C has better performance than LEACH in terms of power dissipation. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Emotion classification is an interesting problem in affective computing that can be applied in various tasks, such as speech synthesis, image processing and text processing. With the increasing amount of textual data on the Internet, especially reviews of customers that express opinions and emotions about products. These reviews are important feedback for companies. Emotion classification aims to identify an emotion label for each review. This research investigated three approaches for emotion classification of opinions in the Thai language, written in unstructured format, free form or informal style. Different sets of features were studied in detail and analyzed. The experimental results showed that a hierarchical approach, where the subjectivity of the review is determined first, then the polarity of opinion is identified and finally the emotional label is calculated, yielded the highest performance, with precision, recall and F-measure at 0.691, 0.743 and 0.709, respectively. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The Java programming language provides binary floating-point primitive data types such as float and double to represent decimal numbers. However, these data types cannot represent decimal numbers with complete accuracy, which may cause precision errors while performing calculations. To achieve better precision, Java provides the BigDecimal class. Unlike float and double, which use approximation, this class is able to represent the exact value of a decimal number. However, it comes with a drawback: BigDecimal is treated as an object and requires additional CPU and memory usage to operate with. In this paper, statistical data are presented of performance impact on using BigDecimal compared to the double data type. As test cases, common mathematical processes were used, such as calculating mean value, sorting, and multiplying matrices. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher,.

AB  - A computing strategy called Double Track–Most Significant Operation First (DT-MSOF) is proposed. The goal of this strategy is to reduce computation time by reducing the number of operations that need to be executed, while maintaining a correct final result. Executions are conducted on a sequence of computing operations that have previously been sorted based on significance. Computation will only run until the result meets the needs of the user. In this study, the DT-MSOF strategy was used to modify the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) algorithm into MD-AHP in order to reduce the number of operations that need to be done. The conventional AHP uses a run-to-completion approach, in which decisions can only be obtained after all of the operations have been completed. On the other hand, the calculations in MD-AHP are carried out iteratively only until the conditions are reached where a decision can be made. The simulation results show that MD-AHP can reduce the number of operations that need to be done to obtain the same results (decisions) as obtained by conventional AHP. It was also found that the more uneven the distribution of priority values, the more the number of operations could be reduced. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher,.

AB  - Parking information systems have become very important, especially in metropolitan areas as they help to save time, effort and fuel when searching for parking. This paper offers a novel low-cost deep learning approach to easily implement vacancy detection at outdoor parking spaces with CCTV surveillance. The proposed method also addresses issues due to perspective distortion in CCTV images. The architecture consists of three classifiers for checking the availability of parking spaces. They were developed on the TensorFlow platform by re-training MobileNet (a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)) model using the transfer learning technique. A performance analysis showed 88% accuracy for vacancy detection. An end-to-end application model with Internet of Things (IoT) and an Android application is also presented. Users can interact with the cloud using their Android application to get real-time updates on parking space availability and the parking location. In the future, an autonomous car could use this system as a V2I (Vehicle to Infrastructure) application in deciding the nearest parking space. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publish.

AB  - Passive biometric identification enables wildlife monitoring with minimal disturbance. Using a motion-activated camera placed at an elevated position and facing downwards, images of sea turtle carapaces were collected, each belonging to one of sixteen Chelonia mydas juveniles. Then, co-variant and robust image descriptors from these images were learned, enabling indexing and retrieval. In this paper, several classification results of sea turtle carapaces using the learned image descriptors are presented. It was found that a template-based descriptor, i.e. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) performed much better during classification than keypoint-based descriptors. For our dataset, a high-dimensional descriptor is a must because of the minimal gradient and color information in the carapace images. Using HOG, we obtained an average classification accuracy of 65%. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher,.

AB  - This research concerns the analysis of social networks using graph theory to find properties that can be used to determine Sybil nodes. This research also investigated the mixing time, which is one of the properties that many existing methods use for detecting Sybil attacks. The results showed that the mixing time does not reflect the difference between honest graphs and Sybil graphs. In addition, the properties of social graphs were studied and it was found that the average node distance is different in graphs containing Sybil nodes than in graphs with only honest nodes. Furthermore, the eigenvector centrality and the degree of Sybil nodes are correlated, while in honest nodes they are not. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher,.

AB  - Nowadays, there is tremendous growth in in-car interfaces for driver safety and comfort, but controlling these devices while driving requires the driver’s attention. One of the solutions to reduce the number of glances at these interfaces is to design an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). A vision-based touch-less hand gesture recognition system is proposed here for in-car human-machine interfaces (HMI). The performance of such systems is unreliable under ambient illumination conditions, which change during the course of the day. Thus, the main focus of this work was to design a system that is robust towards changing lighting conditions. For this purpose, a homomorphic filter with adaptive thresholding binarization is used. Also, gray-level edge-based segmentation ensures that it is generalized for users of different skin tones and background colors. This work was validated on selected gestures from the Cambridge Hand Gesture Database captured in five sets of non-uniform illumination conditions that closely resemble in-car illumination conditions, yielding an overall system accuracy of 91%, an average frame-by-frame accuracy of 81.38%, and a latency of 3.78 milliseconds. A prototype of the proposed system was implemented on a Raspberry Pi 3 interface together with an Android application, which demonstrated its suitability for non-critical in-car interfaces like infotainment systems. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher,.

AB  - A common task in summarizing scientific articles is employing the rhetorical structure of sentences. Determining rhetorical sentences itself passes through the process of text categorization. In order to get good performance, some works in text categorization have been done by employing word embedding. This paper presents rhetorical sentence categorization of scientific articles by using word embedding to capture semantically similar words. A comparison of employing Word2Vec and GloVe is shown. First, two experiments are evaluated using five classifiers, namely Naïve Bayes, Linear SVM, IBK, J48, and Maximum Entropy. Then, the best classifier from the first two experiments was employed. This research showed that Word2Vec CBOW performed better than Skip-Gram and GloVe. The best experimental result was from Word2Vec CBOW for 20,155 resource papers from ACL-ARC, features from Teufel and the previous label feature. In this experiment, Linear SVM produced the highest F-measure performance at 43.44%. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher,.

AB  - K-mer frequencies are commonly used in extracting features from metagenome fragments. In spite of this, researchers have found that their use is still inefficient. In this research, a genetic algorithm was employed to find optimally spaced k-mers. These were obtained by generating the possible combinations of match positions and don’t care positions (written as*). This approach was adopted from the concept of spaced seeds in PatternHunter. The use of spaced k-mers could reduce the size of the k-mer frequency feature’s dimension. To measure the accuracy of the proposed method we used the naïve Bayesian classifier (NBC). The result showed that the chromosome 111111110001, representing spaced k-mer model [111 1111 10001], was the best chromosome, with a higher fitness (85.42) than that of the k-mer frequency feature. Moreover, the proposed approach also reduced the feature extraction time. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher,.

AB  - Securing images can be achieved using cryptography and steganography. Combining both techniques can improve the security of images. Usually, Arnold’s transformation (ACM) is used to encrypt an image by randomizing the image pixels. However, applying only a transformation algorithm is not secure enough to protect the image. In this study, ACM was combined with RSA, another encryption technique, which has an exponential process that uses large numbers. This can confuse attackers when they try to decrypt the cipher images. Furthermore, this paper also proposes combing ACM with RSA and subsequently embedding the result in a cover image with inverted two-bit LSB steganography, which replaces two bits in the bit plane of the cover image with message bits. This modified steganography technique can provide twice the capacity of the previous method. The experimental result was evaluated using PSNR and entropy as the parameters to obtain the quality of the stego images and the cipher images. The proposed method produced a highest PSNR of 57.8493 dB and entropy equal to 7.9948. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher,.

AB  - Students’ ownership of technology devices, their access to software and Web-based utilities, and their related preferences are the subject of this ongoing research. The devices that instructors use in the classroom, how students use online learning systems as provided by the university, and students’ skill levels when using technology for learning are also included. The major objective of this research is to provide a long-term comparative analysis across one university to determine if students’ and lecturers’ use of technology for teaching-learning has changed. Such ongoing data collection and analysis will inform individual institutions about online learning and how to improve facilities for both staff and students for maximum educational success. An initial study was conducted in 2015. This paper reports on the second data collection to determine if there have been any changes over a two-year period. The findings indicate that students have intermediate skill levels when using basic software programs for their study, whereas their social media skills are advanced. Students use mobile devices (phones and tablets) to access online learning materials. Overall, most students and staff lack basic knowledge in using information technology for study purposes. It was concluded that the university should continue to conduct ongoing monitoring and evaluation of students’ and staff’s information technology competencies. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal.

AB  - Multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC) promises better data management for parallel processing than conventional SoC. This feature is very suitable for wireless communication systems. Better data processing management can reduce resource utilization and can potentially reduce power consumption as well. Hence, this research aimed to minimize the orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) processing hardware by proposing a new data sharing architecture on a heterogeneous MPSoC platform that incorporates inter-processor communication (IPC), multi-processor, multi-bus, multi-frequency and parallel processing design of the medium access controller (MAC) layer. This MPSoC was designed based on a RISC processor with an AMBA multi-bus system. To achieve high throughput, the proposed MPSoC runs at two different frequencies, 40 MHz and 80 MHz. The proposed system was implemented and verified using FPGA. The verification results showed that the proposed system can work in real-time with a maximum throughput of 11 MBps using a 40 MHz system clock. The proposed MPSoC is a promising solution to perform OFDMA processing on 4G and 5G technologies. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - A technique for emotion recognition from facial expressions in images with simultaneous pose, illumination and age variation in real time is proposed in this paper. The basic emotions considered are anger, disgust, happy, surprise, and neutral. Feature vectors that were formed from images from the CMU-MultiPIE database for pose and illumination were used for training the classifier. For real-time implementation, Raspberry Pi II was used, which can be placed on a robot to recognize emotions in interactive real-time applications. The proposed method includes face detection using Viola Jones Haar cascade, Active Shape Model (ASM) for feature extraction, and AdaBoost for classification in real-time. Performance of the proposed method was validated in real time by testing with subjects from different age groups expressing basic emotions with varying pose and illumination. 96% recognition accuracy at an average time of 120 ms was obtained. The results are encouraging, as the proposed method gives better accuracy with higher speed compared to existing methods from the literature. The major contribution and strength of the proposed method lie in marking suitable feature points on the face, its speed and invariance to pose, illumination and age in real time. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In this paper we propose a new approach of the compressive sensing (CS) reconstruction problem based on a geometrical interpretation of l1-norm minimization. By taking a large l1-norm value at the initial step, the intersection of l1-norm and the constraint curves forms a convex polytope and by exploiting the fact that any convex combination of the polytope’s vertexes gives a new point that has a smaller l1-norm, we are able to derive a new algorithm to solve the CS reconstruction problem. Compared to the greedy algorithm, this algorithm has better performance, especially in highly coherent environments. Compared to the convex optimization, the proposed algorithm has simpler computation requirements. We tested the capability of this algorithm in reconstructing a randomly down-sampled version of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index. The proposed algorithm achieved a good result but only works on real-valued signals. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - An important problem in visual cryptography is the alignment problem. Although Liu, et al. have proposed a method for aligning the shares, there is still a problem with the non-identical mathematical support visual cryptography schemes. For overcoming this problem, the Three-Orthogonal-Point (3OP) method is proposed in this paper. Based on the experimental result it was proven that it can overcome the alignment problem, while the time complexity for aligning the shares is decreased significantly from O((m×A)2) to O(m×AI), for AI &lt; A. The security is maintained, since an attacker cannot obtain any information related to the secret image. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Visitor interaction with e-commerce websites generates large amounts of clickstream data stored in web access logs. From a business standpoint, clickstream data can be used as a means of finding information on user interest. In this paper, the authors propose a method to find user interest in products offered on e-commerce websites based on web usage mining of clickstream data. In this study, user interest was investigated using the PIE approach coupled with clustering and classification techniques. The experimental results showed that the method is able to assist in analyzing visitor behavior and user interest in e-commerce products by identifying those products that prompt visitor interest. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Level Set Method is a popular method for image segmentation. One of the problems in Level Set Method is finding the right initial surface parameter, which implicitly affects the curve evolution and ultimately the segmentation result. By setting the initial curve too far away from the target object, Level Set Method could potentially miss the target altogether, whereas by setting the initial curve as general as possible – i.e. capturing the whole image – makes Level Set Method susceptible to noise. Recently, deep-learning methods, especially Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), have been proven to achieve state-of-theart performance in many computer vision tasks such as image classification and detection. In this paper, a new method is proposed, called Deep Convolutional Level Set Method (DCLSM). The idea is to use the CNN object detector as a prior for Level Set Method segmentation. Using DCLSM it is possible to significantly improve the segmentation accuracy and precision of the classic Level Set Method. It was also found that the prior used in the proposed method is the lower and upper bound for DCLSM’s precision and recall, respectively. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This study concerns an implementation of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) fluid simulation on a graphics processing unit (GPU) using the Compute Unified Device Architecture’s (CUDA) parallel programming. A bookkeeping method for the neighbor search algorithm was incorporated to accelerate calculations. Based on sequence code profiling of the SPH method, particle interaction computation – which comprises the calculation of the continuity equation and the momentum conservation equation – consumes 95.2% of the calculation time. In this paper, an improvement of the calculation is proposed by calculating the particle interaction part on the GPU and by using a bookkeeping algorithm to restrict the calculation only to contributed particles. Three aspects are addressed in this paper: firstly, speed-up of the CUDA parallel programming computation as a function of the number of particles used in the simulation; secondly, the influence of double precision and single precision schemes on the computational acceleration; and thirdly, calculation accuracy with respect to the number of particles. Scott Russell’s wave generator was implemented for a 2D case and a 3D dam-break. The results show that the proposed method was succesfull in accelerating the SPH simulation on the GPU. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper presents a study on automatic title generation for scientific articles considering sentence information types known as rhetorical categories. A title can be seen as a high-compression summary of a document. A rhetorical category is an information type conveyed by the author of a text for each textual unit, for example: background, method, or result of the research. The experiment in this study focused on extracting the research purpose and research method information for inclusion in a computer-generated title. Sentences are classified into rhetorical categories, after which these sentences are filtered using three methods. Three title candidates whose contents reflect the filtered sentences are then generated using a template-based or an adaptive K-nearest neighbor approach. The experiment was conducted using two different dataset domains: computational linguistics and chemistry. Our study obtained a 0.109-0.255 F1- measure score on average for computer-generated titles compared to original titles. In a human evaluation the automatically generated titles were deemed ‘relatively acceptable’ in the computational linguistics domain and ‘not acceptable’ in the chemistry domain. It can be concluded that rhetorical categories have unexplored potential to improve the performance of summarization tasks in general. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Classification, a process for predicting the class of a given input data, is one of the most fundamental tasks in data mining. Classification performance is negatively affected by noisy data and therefore selecting features relevant to the problem is a critical step in classification, especially when applied to large datasets. In this article, a novel filter-based floating search technique for feature selection to select an optimal set of features for classification purposes is proposed. A genetic algorithm is employed to improve the quality of the features selected by the floating search method in each iteration. A criterion function is applied to select relevant and high-quality features that can improve classification accuracy. The proposed method was evaluated using 20 standard machine learning datasets of various size and complexity. The results show that the proposed method is effective in general across different classifiers and performs well in comparison with recently reported techniques. In addition, the application of the proposed method with support vector machine provides the best performance among the classifiers studied and outperformed previous researches with the majority of data sets. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In wireless networks, available bandwidth estimation is challenging because wireless channels are used by multiple users or applications concurrently. In this study, we propose a passive measurement scheme to estimate the available bandwidth in 802.12 wireless networks based on the combination and modification of two existing schemes, Distributed Lagrange Interpolation Based Available Bandwidth Estimation (DLI-ABE) and Accurate Passive Bandwidth Estimation (APBE). The proposed scheme uses the channel busy state, which is affected by transmitting or receiving processes caused by carrier sensing. Therefore, the sender and the receiver node should be synchronized using various states that can be affected by other nodes. Moreover, the proposed scheme was developed with the involvement of relevant calculation of possible overhead caused by control messaging that occurs in the Media Access Control (MAC) layer and collision probability caused by data flow from hidden nodes. The result showed that the proposed scheme can estimate the available bandwidth of wireless networks more accurately than DLI-ABE and APBE. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Natural produce recognition is a classification problem with various applications in the food industry. This paper proposes a natural produce recognition method using computer vision. The proposed method uses simple features consisting of statistical color features and the derivative of radius function. A hybrid neural network and linear model based on a Kalman filter (NN-LMKF) was employed as classifier. One thousand images from ten categories of natural produce were used to validate the proposed method by using 5-fold cross validation. The experimental result showed that the proposed method achieved classification accuracy of 98.40%. This means it performed better than the original neural network and k-nearest neighborhood. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Document image analysis and recognition are important topics in the field of artificial intelligence. In this context, the availability of a database with good script samples is an important requirement for machine-learning processes. For Latin and Asian languages many suitable databases exist. However, there is a shortage of databases with Arabic samples. In this work, a new database of printed Arabic text is introduced. The new concept of collecting sub-words (PAWs) instead of words or individual character samples was adopted. These PAWs constitute all words in the Arabic language. The collected database consists of 83,056 images of PAWs extracted from approximately 550,000 different words. Each sample is presented in the database in five font types: Thuluth, Naskh, Andalusi, Typing Machine, and Kufi. In total, the database consists of 415,280 images. Moreover, ground truth information is included with each PAW image to describe its occurrence number, occurrence frequency, positions and the shapes of the characters. This paper presents a statistical analysis of the frequency of each PAW in the Arabic language. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Geo-demographic analysis (GDA) is the study of population characteristics by geographical area. Fuzzy Geographically Weighted Clustering (FGWC) is an effective algorithm used in GDA. Improvement of FGWC has been done by integrating a metaheuristic algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), as a global optimization tool to increase the clustering accuracy in the initial stage of the FGWC algorithm. However, using ACO in FGWC increases the time to run the algorithm compared to the standard FGWC algorithm. In this paper, context-based clustering and CUDA parallel programming are proposed to improve the performance of the improved algorithm (FGWC-ACO). Context-based clustering is a method that focuses on the grouping of data based on certain conditions, while CUDA parallel programming is a method that uses the graphical processing unit (GPU) as a parallel processing tool. The Indonesian Population Census 2010 was used as the experimental dataset. It was shown that the proposed methods were able to improve the performance of FGWC-ACO without reducing the clustering quality of the original method. The clustering quality was evaluated using the clustering validity index. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - As biological image databases are growing rapidly, automated species identification based on digital data becomes of great interest for accelerating biodiversity assessment, research and monitoring. This research applied high performance computing (HPC) to a medicinal plant identification system. A parallel technique for medicinal plant image processing using Fuzzy Local Binary Pattern (FLBP) is proposed. The FLBP method extends the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) approach by employing fuzzy logic to represent texture images. The main goal of this research was to measure the efficiency of using the proposed parallel technique for medicinal plant image processing and evaluation in order to find out whether this approach is reasonable for handling large data sets. The parallel processing technique was designed in a message-sending model. 30 species of Indonesian medical plants were analyzed. Each species was represented by 48 leaf images. Performance evaluation was measured using the speed-up, efficiency, and isoefficiency of the parallel computing technique. Preliminary results show that HPC worked well in reducing the execution time of medical plant identification. In this work, parallel processing of training images was 7.64 times faster than with sequential processing, with efficiency values greater than 0.9. Parallel processing of testing images was 6.73 times faster than with sequential processing, with efficiency values over 0.9. The system was able to identify images with an accuracy of 68.89%. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This research attempted to measure chicken intramuscular fat content using improved ultrasound B-mode images and image segmentation. Adapted B-mode imaging is proposed to increase the positioning accuracy of B-mode images with the objective to correct the phase error due to the use of predetermined ultrasonic velocity in conventional B-mode imaging. The predetermined velocity is replaced by actual velocity measured using A-mode imaging. The positioning accuracy of adapted and conventional B-mode imaging was validated using 144 chicken samples. The adapted B-mode image had better positioning accuracy compared to a conventional B-mode image since the method used was able to detect the thickness of the chicken sample with a lower mean difference (0.036±0.034mm vs. 0.113±0.010). Both methods were then applied for measurement of intramuscular fat content. The histogram mean and the percentage of fat pixels were the B-mode image characteristics that were extracted and their correlation with the fat content, measured using the Soxhlet method, was analyzed. The properties of the adapted B-mode images correlated better with the Soxhlet-measured fat content compared to the properties of the conventional B-mode images as reflected in the correlation coefficient, r, for the histogram mean (0.357 vs. 0.129) and the percentage of fat pixels (0.406 vs. 0.289). The results indicate the potential of using ultrasound adapted B-mode imaging to measure chicken intramuscular fat. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Both non-metamorphic animation and metamorphic animation of objects or multi-objects in IFS fractal form as basic animation method can be implemented by a modified version of the random iteration algorithm as basic algorithm. In this way it is possible to create an attractive animation based on the combination of both animation methods as a generic animation method, as discussed in this paper. The proposed method can be used as an alternative for or as an extension of the existing animation methods in classical geometry, which are restricted to objects with regular forms. The proposed method can be used to produce more attractive media for interactively learning about the behavior of manipulated objects of any form. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - To simulate real-world phenomena, a computer tool can be used to run a simulation and provide a detailed report. By using a computer-aided simulation tool, we can retrieve information relevant to the simulated subject in a relatively short time. This study is an extended and complete version of an initial research done by Christian and Hansun and presents a prototype of a multi-agent shopping center simulation tool along with a fuzzy logic algorithm implemented in the system. Shopping centers and all their components are represented in a simulated 3D environment. The simulation tool was created using the Unity3D engine to build the 3D environment and to run the simulation. To model and simulate the behavior of agents inside the simulation, a fuzzy logic algorithm that uses the agents’ basic knowledge as input was built to determine the agents’ behavior inside the system and to simulate human behaviors as realistically as possible. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - A call detail record (CDR) is a data record produced by telecommunication equipment consisting of call detail transaction logs. It contains valuable information for many purposes in several domains, such as billing, fraud detection and analytical purposes. However, in the real world these needs face a big data challenge. Billions of CDRs are generated every day and the processing systems are expected to deliver results in a timely manner. The capacity of our current production system is not enough to meet these needs. Therefore a better performing system based on MapReduce and running on Hadoop cluster was designed and implemented. This paper presents an analysis of the previous system and the design and implementation of the new system, called MS2. In this paper also empirical evidence is provided to demonstrate the efficiency and linearity of MS2. Tests have shown that MS2 reduces overhead by 44% and speeds up performance nearly twice compared to the previous system. From benchmarking with several related technologies in large-scale data processing, MS2 was also shown to perform better in the case of CDR batch processing. When it runs on a cluster consisting of eight CPU cores and two conventional disks, MS2 is able to process 67,000 CDRs/second. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Virtual prototyping is natural in developing digital signal processing (DSP) systems using a product-service-value system (PSV-S) approach. Our DSP virtual prototyping approach consists of four development phases: (1) a generic DSP system, (2) a functional DSP system, (3) an architectural DSP system, and (4) a real-time DSP system. Such an approach results in a more comprehensive approach in the DSP system development. This paper shows an example of prototyping a voice codec on a single-chip DSP processor. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Agreement on word-object pairing in communication depends on the intensity of the beliefs that gradually emerge in a society of agents, on the condition that no one was born with embedded knowledge. The agents search and exchange ideas about unknown word-object pairings, until they meet a consensus about what the object should be named. A language game is a social process of finding agreement on word-object pairings through communication in a multi-agent system. In this paper, a technique is proposed to discover the association between a word and the agents’ beliefs on an object using self-organizing maps and a cultural algorithm in a multi-hearer environment. A conceptual space is implemented, which stores the agent’s beliefs in three dimensions, represented by colors. The technique was evaluated for a variety of scenarios using four significant measures: coherence, specificity, success rate, and word size. The results showed that with the proposed method social agents can reach agreement fast and that their communication is effective. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Mobile WiMax uses Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) in uplink where synchronization is a complex task as each user presents a different carrier frequency offset (CFO). In the Data Aided Phase Incremental Technique (DA-PIT) estimation is performed after FFT operation to use the received frequency domain pilot subcarrier information. As estimation is done in the presence of noise, there exists some offset error, which is called residual frequency offset (RFO). The Simple Time Domain Multi User Interference Cancellation scheme (SI-MUIC) is a time domain approach which takes a longer time delay to compensate the CFO effect for the last user. Decorrelation-Successive Interference Cancellation (DC-SC) and Integrated Estimation and Compensation (IEC) are frequency domain approaches that compensate the CFO effect with a more complex method for ICI cancellation. The Modified Integrated Estimation and Compensation technique (Modified IEC) is proposed for better residual CFO compensation. The proposed technique has better performance due to its efficient suppression of ICI and MUI. The difference between the CFOs of two OFDMA symbols lies within the range of RFO that is not considered in the conventional compensation techniques, such as the SI-MUIC, DC-SC and IEC compensation techniques. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The image fusion steganographic system embeds encrypted messages in decomposed multimedia carriers using a pseudorandom generator but it fails to evaluate the contents of the cover image. This results in the secret data being embedded in smooth regions, which leads to visible distortion that affects the imperceptibility and confidentiality. To solve this issue, as well as to improve the quality and robustness of the system, the Randomized Symmetric Crypto Spatial Fusion Steganography System is proposed in this study. It comprises three-subsystem bitwise encryption, spatial fusion, and bitwise embedding. First, bitwise encryption encrypts the message using bitwise operation to improve the confidentiality. Then, spatial fusion decomposes and evaluates the region of embedding on the basis of sharp intensity and capacity. This restricts the visibility of distortion and provides a high embedding capacity. Finally, the bitwise embedding system embeds the encrypted message through differencing the pixels in the region by 1, checking even or odd options and not equal to zero constraints. This reduces the modification rate to avoid distortion. The proposed heuristic algorithm is implemented in the blue channel, to which the human visual system is less sensitive. It was tested using standard IST natural images with steganalysis algorithms and resulted in better quality, imperceptibility, embedding capacity and invulnerability to various attacks compared to other steganographic systems. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The banking sector is the backbone of the entire financial economy of a country. In today’s globalized world, most organizations use online transaction processing systems for transferring money and doing business. Natural or man-made disasters can lead to data loss which in turn can cause millions of dollars of money lost. This study focuses on disaster recovery practices in commercial banks in Sri Lanka. From our preliminary findings, it was concluded that commercial banks only have ad-hoc disaster recovery standards and practices, as there is no standard framework available. Fourteen (14) banks were selected for data collection and relevant authorities were interviewed. The results were translated as qualitative observations to understand the best practices. Similarly, international standards, compliance requirements of the central bank, and existing researches were used to develop a disaster recovery practice framework. The proposed framework was then validated for its efficiency and usefulness among commercial banks and found to be acceptable by the banking industry. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Transmission lines are utilized in many applications to convey energy as well as information. Nonuniform transmission lines (NTLs) are obtained through variation of the characteristic quantities along the axial direction. Such NTLs can be used to design network elements, like matching circuits, delay equalizers, filters, VLSI interconnections, etc. In this work, NTLs were analyzed with a numerical method based on the implementation of method of moment. In order to approximate the voltage and current distribution along the transmission line, a sum of basis functions with unknown amplitudes was introduced. As basis function, a constant function was used. In this work, we observed several cases such as lossless and lossy uniform transmission lines with matching and arbitrary load. These cases verified the algorithm developed in this work. The second example consists of nonuniform transmission lines in the form of abruptly changing transmission lines. This structure was used to design a Chebychev’s low pass filter. The calculated reflection and transmission factors of the filters showed some coincidences with the measurements. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) is one of the promising technologies for future-generation wireless networks. It offers high data rates, protection against frequency-selective fading and efficient utilization of the spectrum. The peak to average power ratio (PAPR) is very high in MC-CDMA systems. The partial transmit sequence technique (PTS) and the selective mapping technique (SLM) reduce the PAPR with more computational complexity. In this study, the NORM technique was used for PAPR reduction in MC-CDMA systems. The performance of NORM was analyzed with PTS and SLM in terms of cumulative complementary distribution, power saving gain, amplifier efficiency, computational complexity and bit error rate. Simulation results showed that NORM has better PAPR reduction with less computational complexity. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The business value of information technology (IT) services is often difficult to assess, especially from the point of view of a non-IT manager. This condition could severely impact organizational IT strategic decisions. Various approaches have been proposed to quantify the business value, but some are trapped in technical complexity while others misguide managers into directly and subjectively judging some technical entities outside their domain of expertise. This paper describes a method on how to properly capture both perspectives based on a probabilistic business-driven model. The proposed model presents a procedure to calculate the business value of IT services. The model also covers IT security services and their business value as an important aspect of IT services that is not covered in previously published researches. The impact of changes in the quality of IT services on business value will also be discussed. A simulation and a case illustration are provided to show the possible application of the proposed model for a simple business process in an enterprise. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Spectrum sensing for cognitive radio is a challenging task since it has to be able to detect the primary signal at a low signal to noise ratio (SNR). At a low SNR, the variance of noise fluctuates due to noise uncertainty. Detection of the primary signal will be difficult especially for blind spectrum sensing methods that rely on the variance of noise for their threshold setting, such as energy detection. Instead of using the energy difference, we propose a spectrum sensing method based on the distribution difference. When the channel is occupied, the distribution of the received signal, which propagates under a wireless fading channel, will have a non-Gaussian distribution. This will be different from the Gaussian noise when the channel is vacant. Kurtosis, a higher order statistic (HOS) of the 4th order, is used as normality test for the test statistic. We measured the detection rate of the proposed method by performing a simulation of the detection process. Our proposed method’s performance proved superior in detecting a real digital TV signal in noise uncertainty. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Increasing numbers of wireless local area networks (WLAN) replacing wired networks have an impact on wireless network systems, causing issues such as interference. The smart antenna system is a method to overcome interference issues in WLANs. This paper proposes an artificial immune system (AIS) for a switch beam smart antenna system. A directional antenna is introduced to aim the beam at the desired user. The antenna consists of 8 directional antennas, each of which covers 45 degrees, thus creating an omnidirectional configuration of which the beams cover 360 degrees. To control the beam switching, an inexpensive PIC 16F877 microchip was used. An AIS algorithm was implemented in the microcontroller, which uses the received radio signal strength of the mobile device as reference. This is compared for each of the eight beams, after which the AIS algorithm selects the strongest signal received by the system and the microcontroller will then lock to the desired beam. In the experiment a frequency of 2.4 GHz (ISM band) was used for transmitting and receiving. A test of the system was conducted in an outdoor environment. The results show that the switch beam smart antenna worked fine based on locating the mobile device. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - A range of international regulatory documents state the importance of counteracting insiders, especially cyber-insiders, in critical facilities and simultaneously providing complex protection, which includes technical, administrative and information protection. In that case the insider, who is familiar with the protection or information system, will be able to find vulnerabilities and weak points in the protection of the information system or control system. One of the most important aspects of the preventive measures against insiders is personnel checks using different techniques, including interviews, social network analysis, and local area network analysis. In the case of having limited financial resources, it is necessary to choose a technique from a checklist rationally. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In digital forensic investigations, the investigators take digital evidence from computers, laptops or other electronic goods. There are many complications when a suspect or related person does not want to cooperate or has removed digital evidence. A lot of research has been done with the goal of retrieving data from flash memory or other digital storage media from which the content has been deleted. Unfortunately, such methods cannot guarantee that all data will be recovered. Most data can only be recovered partially and sometimes not perfectly, so that some or all files cannot be opened. This paper proposes the development of a new method for the retrieval of digital evidence called the Two-Step Injection method (TSI). It focuses on the prevention of the loss of digital evidence through the deletion of data by suspects or other parties. The advantage of this method is that the system works in secret and can be combined with other digital evidence applications that already exist, so that the accuracy and completeness of the resulting digital evidence can be improved. An experiment to test the effectiveness of the method was set up. The developed TSI system worked properly and had a 100% success rate. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper deals with a prediction method using the hidden Markov model (HMM) for rain rate and rain propagation attenuation for K-band satellite communications links in tropical areas. As is well known, the K-band frequency is susceptible of being affected by atmospheric conditions, especially rain conditions. The wavelength of the K-band frequency, which approaches the size of a rain droplet, causes the signal strength to be attenuated and absorbed easily by the rain droplets. Therefore, in order to maintain the quality of system performance for K-band satellite communications links, special attention has to be paid to rain rate and rain propagation attenuation. Thus, a prediction method for rain rate and rain propagation attenuation based on HMM was developed to process measurement data. The measured and predicted data were then compared with ITU-R recommendations. The results indicate that the data show similarity with the model of recommendation ITU-R P.837-5 for rain rate and the model of recommendation ITU-R P.618-10 for rain propagation attenuation. Meanwhile, statistical data for measured and predicted data such as fade duration and interfade duration show insignificant discrepancies with the model of recommendation ITU-R P.1623-1 © 2014, Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Deploying WiMAX through High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) system is a new means of wireless delivery method and thus attracting much the attention in a telecommunication society. However delivering WiMAX through the terrestrial network has already been started a few years ago. Therefore, we need to look at the scenario of coexistence system both of HAPS and terrestrial in delivering WiMAX services. This paper evaluates the performance of coexistence system between cellular HAPS and terrestrial for the downlink scenario when they are transmitting WiMAX mobile 802.16e services. Our evaluation is based on the performance simulation of coexistence model using two methods. First method is a footprint exchange between the two systems. The second method is a combination of footprint exchange and HAPS footprint enhancement. The proposed methods are then evaluated by computer simulation in terms of carrier to interference plus noise ratio (CINR) performance. In general, both methods resulting performance enhancement in CINR quality compared with coexistence deployment with normal scenario of the cell configuration used by HAPS and terrestrial. The method of combining footprint exchange and HAPS footprint enhancement is able to improve CINR more than 10 dB compared with the normal footprint configuration for all users location inside the coverage. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Information about medicinal plants that is available in text documents is generally quite easy to access, however, one needs some efforts to use it. This research was aimed at utilizing crucial information taken from a text document to identify the family of several species of medicinal plants using a heuristic approach, i.e. genetic programming. Each of the species has its unique features. The genetic program puts the characteristics or special features of each family into a tree form. There are a number of processes involved in the investigated method, i.e. data acquisition, booleanization, grouping of training and test data, evaluation, and analysis. The genetic program uses a training process to select the best individual, initializes a generate-rule process to create several individuals and then executes a fitness evaluation. The next procedure is a genetic operation process, which consists of tournament selection to choose the best individual based on a fitness value, the crossover operation and the mutation operation. These operations have the purpose of complementing the individual. The best individual acquired is the expected solution, which is a rule for classifying medicinal plants. This process produced three rules, one for each plant family, displaying a feature structure that distinguishes each of the families from each other. The genetic program then used these rules to identify the medicinal plants, achieving an average accuracy of 86.47%. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - We present and evaluate the implementation of Part of Speech (POS) Tagging for the Kadazan language by using the Transformation-based approach. The main purpose of this study is to develop an automatic POS tagging for the Kadazan language, which had never, been developed before. POS tagging can tag the Kadazan corpus automatically and can help reduce the disambiguation problem of this language. The implementation of this approach in this study is to achieve a better and higher accuracy or at least similar to that of the other tagging approaches such as the statistical and the original rule-based approach. This approach can transform the tags based on the prescribed set of rules. A number of objectives were set in order to achieve the main purpose of this study. Firstly, to apply the lexical and contextual rules for this language. Secondly, to implement the Brill's algorithm based on the set of rules and finally to determine the effectiveness of the Kadazan Part of Speech by using this approach. The tagging system had been trained using four Kadazan corpuses containing 5663 words in all. Based on the evaluation results, the tagging system had achieved around 93% accuracy. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.
