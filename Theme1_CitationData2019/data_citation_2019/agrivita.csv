A novel molyb-denum-reducing bacterium with the ability to utilize the pesticide glyphosate as a carbon source is reported. The characterization works were carried out utilizing bacterial resting cells in a microplate format. The bacterium reduces molybdate to Mo-blue optimally between pH 6.3 and 6.8 and at 34oC. Glucose was the best elec-tron donor for supporting molybdate reduction followed by lactose, maltose, melibiose, raffinose, d-mannitol, d-xylose, l-rhamnose, l-arabinose, dulcitol, myo-inositol and glycerol in descending order. Other requirements include a phosphate concentration at 5.0 mM and a molybdate concentration between 20 and 30 mM. The molybdenum blue exhibited an absorption spec-trum resembling a reduced phospho-molybdate. Molybdenum reduction was inhibited by mercury, silver, cadmium and copper at 2 ppm by 45.5, 26.0, 18.5 and 16.3%, respectively. Biochemical analysis identified the bacterium as Klebsiella oxytoca strain Saw-5. To conclude, the capacity of this bacterium to reduce molybdenum into a less toxic form and to grow on glyphosate is novel and makes the bacterium an important instrument for bioremediation of these pollutants. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Callus were initiated from basal petal and staminoid explants cultured on callus induction (CI) medium contained DKW basalt salts and kinetin:2,4-D ratios of 1:15.5, 1:7.8 or 1:3.9 and then transferred onto secondary callus growth (SCG) medium contained WPM basalt salts and kinetin:2,4-D ratios of 1:7.8 or 1:3.9. The calli were then subsequently transferred onto embryo development medium contained DKW basal salts with or without the addition of amino acids, adenine or activated charcoal for the formation of somatic embryos. Nine cacao genotypes were tested for their ability to develop somatic embryos. Results of this study indicated DKW medium supplemented with Kinetin in combination with 2,4-D effectively induced cacao somatic embryogenesis. The highest somatic embryos formation was abtained from kinetin:2,4-D ratio of 1:3.9 and 1:7.8 in CI and SCG medium respectively. Cacao genotype responses were highly explant type dependent.

In addition, death of trees spread to other regencies in East Java. Euplatypus parallelus is a specific species of ambrosia beetles that were the causal agents to the dying and wilting of sonokembang trees in Malang. Wilting is caused mainly by the pathogenic fungi carried by ambrosia beetles. To confirm the microbial communities related to E. parallelus that attack sonokembang, E. parallelus and some attacked trees were collected in Malang city. Isolation and identification of these species were conducted at the Laboratory of Mycology, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Brawijaya and Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Islamic State University, Malang. Results showed that there were nine microbes including five genera of fungi, two genera of yeasts and one genus of bacterium were identified. The microbial communities that were found namely Aspergillus spp., Penicillium spp., Trichoderma spp., Fusarium spp., Acremonium spp., Gliocladium spp. (fungi), Streptomyces spp. (bacteria), Saccharomyces spp., and Candida spp. (yeast). © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Many researchers’ showed that rambutan peel contains polyphenol that could be expected to avoid obesity. The objective of this study was to explore the increasing production of local rambutan and to identify the promising phyto-chemical compounds on its peel as phyto-pharmaca candidate against obesity. Survey was conducted on the production of rambutan, potential plantation area, and marketing. Sample of rambutan peel collected from the sub-district Kanigoro, Blitar. Phytochemical compounds were analyzed using TLC, HPLC and FT-IR. Bioassay analysis used obesity rat models. The survey result showed a mean of rambutan production increased 2.6% in 2007-2012. Average production of rambutan 70-120 kg/tree. Vegetative multi-plication usually done to maintenance of rambutan quality. The main compound of Rambutan peel extract (RPE) is flavonoids, tannins, ellagic acid and the major functional group of CH3, aliphatic CH3, and C=O.

In addition, the effects of timing and frequency of fertilizer applications on rice cultivated at riparian wetland also have to be understood. In this research, both single and split applications of fertilizer were employed. The single fertilizer applications were applied at 15 days after transplanting (DAT) (T1), 30 DAT (T2), 45 DAT (T3); and the split applications were 15+30 DAT (T4), 15+45 DAT (T5), 30+45 DAT (T6), and 15+30+45 DAT (T7). Results of this research indicated that crops in the edge rows produced higher leaf area index but those at internal rows produced higher dry weight biomass. Split fertilizer application to three times (T7) increased the weight of grains and number of filled spikelet but did not affect other shoot and root growth traits. Overall, fertilizer application increased leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen content.

The objectives of this research were: (i) to identify the suitable area for soybean plantation in paddy fields, (ii) to assess the development of soybeans in land use and socio-economic context, and (iii) to plan the spatial plantation of soybean. A land evaluation for soybean was completed. IKONOS imagery was analyzed to delineate paddy fields, while a dynamic system modelling was developed integrating physical and socio-economic aspects. The research results showed that the land suitability class for soybean plantation in the paddy fields in Karawang Regency ranged from not suitable (N) to suitable (S2), with limiting factors such as temperature, fertility, nutrients retention, slope, erosion, rooting media and toxicity. Very limited arable land has been used actually for soybeans plantation due to low economic returns. The model predicts that if the development of soybean continues in its business as usual path, a deficit of soybean will increase in 2030. The model provides alternative scenarios to reduce the deficit. Prioritization was done spatially using the suitable land gradually. © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

For the purpose of mass propagation, procedures for in vitro propagation through callus were developed. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of plant growth regulators (PGRs) on callus induction from leaf tip explant and the effects of complex additives on PLBs formation and shoot develop-ment. The best combination of PGR was 3.0 mg L-1 Thidiazuron (TDZ) with 0.046 mg L-1 NAA supplemented in half-strength medium (1/2 MS) (Murashige &amp; Skoog, 1962). The percentage of survival and callus formation obtained were 96.0 % ± 19.8 and 52.0 % ± 16.5 respectively. Maximum shoot proliferation from PLBs was observed in Knudson C (KC) medium enriched with 15 % (v/v) coconut water. In this treatment, 10.2 ± 6.2 shoots were produced from one callus explant. Shoots were rooted on KC medium containing 15 % (v/v) coconut water and transferred in a medium mixture containing sphagnum moss, charcoal, brick and coco peat with the ratio of 1:1:1:1. After 2 months being acclimatized in the glasshouse, 78 % of plantlets survived. Histology observations showed that embryogenic callus derived from leaf tip explants might originate from epidermis and mesophyll cells and was capable of developing into complete plantlets. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Fruit characterization results show that each banana cultivar had specific characteristics related to their genomic group. Pisang Berlin has bright yellow peel and pulp, sugary taste. Pisang Ambon Hijau has fine curved fruit shape, sweet taste and aromatic. Pisang Raja Bandung has medium thickness and yellow peel, firm flesh, sweet and slightly acidic taste. Pisang Kepok has thick coarse and yellow peel with dark brown blotches, mild sweet taste. Fruit characters of Pisang Berlin and Ambon Hijau are close related to their ancestral parents’ Musa acuminata wild species, whereas Pisang Kepok and Pisang Raja Bandung as hybrid cultivars have intermediate characters between Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana wild species. Nutrient analysis revealed that mature banana pulp contain of high carbo-hydrates (16.72-35.24 g 100g-1), total sugar (12.12-20.82 g 100g-1), vitamin C (16.45-30.27 g 100g-1) and potassium (275-375 g 100g-1); moderate protein (1.48-1.78 g 100g-1) and low fat (0.03-0.08 g 100g-1).

Experiments were arranged in completely randomized design using three aerobic rice cultivars and PEG with four replications. Rice varieties (Inpago-8, IR64 and Situ Bagendit) were combined with four different PEG concentrations. Drought stress was simulated by different PEG solutions and with distilled water as control. Results indicated differentiations between hydro and on priming indicator time, while varietal difference was not significant. Fastest recorded time was obtained between 30-36 hours under hydro priming, PEG 100 g L-1 (63-69 hours) and 83-93 hours in PEG 200 g L-1 solution. Thus showing increased solution concentration led to prolonged priming indicator time. The highest germination percentage was obtained in Situ Bagendit treated with PEG 200 mg L-1 (90.25%) and the lowest obtained in Inpago-8 (75.75%) under control. It is better to use osmo-priming (PEG 200 g L-1) for teaching aerobic rice seed against drought stress. More research is needed to confirm benefits of seed treatment with PEG to cultivated crops under water stress, drought and salinity conditions. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The objective of this research was to analyse the suitable land available for agriculture. The research was conducted in Bogor, a hinterland regency of Jakarta. The methodology used includes two steps of analysis, which are land suitability and land availability analysis. Land suitability for agriculture was analysed using multi-criteria decision making method. Seven (7) criteria were included, which consist of soil class, land capability class, slope, elevation, slope aspect, land use/land cover and distance to roads. The criteria were weighted using the Analytical Hierarchy Process. Combining criteria weights and sub-criteria scores, an overlay model in Geographic Information System was applied. The result from land suitability analysis was used as a feed for determining land availability, considering the forest area status and land allocation in the official spatial land use plan. The results indicate that an area amounting to 87.5% of Bogor Regency is suitable for agriculture. Land which is suitable and available for agriculture is 16.7% of the regency’s area. Considering available land which is currently in use, the area that can be allocated for the expansion of agriculture is 3.3%. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Palm oil mill effluent (POME) is considered as a polluted wastewater and the treated POME sludge was produced from the open treatment ponds. The objective of this study was to determine the physicochemical characteristics of treated POME sludge and its potential as an organic fertilizer. It was collected from the dumping ponds in Felda Jengka 8, palm oil mill. Physicochemical characteristics, sampling and preparation of samples were analyzed according to the standard method of soil and the wastewater. The samples were collected after one and six month of age with different depths (one, two and three meters). The statistical analysis revealed that the depth was not significant on the physico-chemical characteristics. The characteristics of the treated POME sludge was measures using CHNS-O, C/N ratio, solid analysis, heavy metal, macro- and micronutrient, moisture content, and pH. However, the elements of oxygen, iron and pH were shown an interaction effects with time. In conclusion, the treated POME sludge has shown significant effect and the potential used as an organic fertilizer. Indeed, further studies on crops response are being conducted to prove the findings. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

A constraint of narrow genetic variability of chilli in Indonesia has made the mutation breeding program as a solution worth-pursuing in increasing the genetic variability. The objective of this study was to determine the LD50point for each of the five irradiated chilli genotypes and the optimum dose of gamma irradiation in inducing chilli resistance toBegomovirusand other improved agronomical traits. The study was conducted in the Indonesian Vegetable Research Institute (IVEGRI) at Cikole-Lembang, elevation 1,200 m above sea level, from March to December 2013. Split plot design was used with genotype as main factor (Kencana, Lembang-1, SSP, Tanjung 2, Seloka) and irra-diation dosage as sub-factor (0, 200, 400, 600, 800 Gy). All treatments were replicated three times. The results showed that LD50points of the five irradiated chilli genotypes were in the range of 422.64-629.68 Gy. There were some chilli genotypes in the population of M2that had high coefficient variance genetic (CVG) and broad sense heritability (h2 bs) value for disease incu-bation time. This could be used as resistance parameter toBegomovirusand improvement parameter of several agronomical traits. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The results showed that the adaptive responses of white jabon seedling to drought and waterlogging stresses were affected by genotype (population). The drought and waterlogging stresses significantly inhibited plant growth, biomass accumulation and allocation, leaf area, also decreased chlorophyll content, increased carotenoids contents, and accumulated free proline. Relative water content and specific leaf area tended to be higher in waterlogging and declined in drought stresses. The result clearly indicated that white jabon seedlings were more adaptive to waterlogging than to drought stresses. Moreover, there were different responses to drought and waterlogging stresses between the twelve populations. Kampar, Gowa, Kuala Kencana and OKI populations exhibited higher growth performance and stress tolerance index to be adapted to waterlogging stress, while Gowa, Pomalaa and Kampar populations had relatively better growth performance in the drought stress. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the biochemical contents of C. moschata based on the altitudes and also to examine whether any relationship between the environmental conditions and protein, carbohydrate and lipid contents. Proximate analysis was used for statistical consideration of the results obtained. Chemical analysis was conducted by using mesocarp of pumpkin after cleaning, peeling and removing seeds from the center of fruits. Kjedahl and soxhlet methods were used to look at the content of protein and lipid respectively. Meanwhile, the method of difference was employed to measure the percentage of carbohydrates. Although there was no significant relationship between the biochemical contents and the environmental conditions, it was recorded that plants grown at higher altitudes with high soil pH and air temperature tended to have higher protein, carbohydrate and lipid contents, compared to that of higher soil moisture. This results showed that the highest biochemical contents of protein, carbohydrate and lipid of two varieties C. moschata were evident at the lowest altitude. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The experiment was conducted in greenhouse using 20 cm diameter plastic pot filled with fine soil, arranged in completely randomized design (CRD) with four treatments. Each treatment combination was repeated three times. Three seeds of local soybean variety were planted into each pot then to remain one plant a week after planting. Variables observed were root nodules number, shoot dry weight and seed yield. Plant nutrients were supplied in the form of solution to meet crop needs. The data obtained were analyzed statistically by F test at 5% of level confidence, followed by Duncan's multiple range test when there was a significant effect. The results showed that both exogenous amino acid tryptophan and IAA increased number of root nodules, shoot and root dry weight and soybean yield. Higher root nodules number was taken from the treatment combination of 0.001 ppm IAA applied at V3 in Alfisol and Vertisols, and 1.0 ppm on Entisols. However, the highest soybean yields were taken from the treatment combination of 1.0 ppm tryptophan applied at V0 in Alfisols (6.51 g plant-1). © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

In the experiment, a randomized block design with seven treatments and three-time replication was applied, namely control (without biochar and KCl), biochar (30 t ha-1) with various doses of potassium fertilizer (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg KCl ha-1) and potassium fertilizer treatment of 200 kg KCl ha-1 without biochar. The first planting used 90 kg N ha-1 basic fertilizer and 100 kg P2O5 ha-1, while the second planting fertilizer was added with 90 kg N ha-1. The results showed that biochar containing potassium was soluble and leached. The amount of potassium leached from the soil given the biochar 30 t ha-1 did not differ from that given 200 kg KCl ha-1. The amount of potassium leached was not different, ranging from 439-449 mg l-1 in the first growing season (MT I) and 16-23 mg l-1 in the second growing season (MT II) at various doses of KCl with biochar. © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Determination of physical characteristics of Ultisol was aimed to evaluate the dynamics of the soil properties as well as the impact on soil erosion and runoff (RO) during soybean cultivation in a wet tropical area. Soybean was planted within erosion plots (18 m2) at 25% slope in Ultisols Limau Manis (having &gt; 5000 mm annual rainfall).Soil samples for physical properties (soil texture, bulk density, total pore, permeability, aggregate stability,and organic carbon) as well as amount of RO and soil loss were analyzed at 5 different times (stages) during the cultivation. The results showed that there were fluctuations in physical properties of Ultisol during the cultivation. Likewise, the amount of runoff and soil loss also changed during the study. Among the physical properties analyzed, the aggregate stability index of the soil was highly correlated to the amount of RO (R2=0.73) and soil loss (R2=0.94). The amount of RO and soil loss was controlled by soybean development at the average rainfall intensity (≤ 36 mm/day), not at rainfall intensity (&gt;36 mm/day). Thus, It is suggested not to open heavy clayey and low organic carbon (OC) soils for seasonal crop farming during rainy season in wet tropical areas. © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The objectives of the research were to obtain the application of antagonistic microbes to inhibit the wilt disease caused by R.solanacearum and to increase the growth and yield of potato in middle latitude. The research was conducted from July to October 2012. Antagonistic microbes were used in this research to inhibit the bacterial wilt disease caused by R.solanacearum on potato planted in Bumiaji, Batu. Trichoderma viride, Streptomyces sp. and Pseudomonas fluorescens isolates were selected to be applied as treatments either singly or in combination. Randomised block design was applied on the treatment group with three replications. The results showed that the single application of Pseudomonas fluorescens or combined application of Streptomyces sp. and Trichodermaviride + Streptomycessp. was capable of extending incubation period 4 to 7 days and reducing disease incidence 44.85% - 50.09%, reducing disease intensity up to 61.23 - 72.77%, reducing the population R.solanacearum up to 7.28 - 97.88%, increasing the number of leaves and the marketable yield as much as 67.96 - 81.98%.","Antagonistic microbes; Control; Middle latitude; Ralstonia solanacearum",,,,,,,,,,,"Arwiyanto, T., (1998) Biological control for bacterial wilt disease on tobacco, p. 58. , Laporan Riset Unggulan Terpadu IV (1996-1998); Baharuddin, N., Kuswinanti, T., Pengaruh pemberian Pseudomonas fluorescens dan Effective Microorganism 4dalam menekan penyakit layu bakteri (Ralstonia solanacearum) pada tanaman cabai (Capsicum annum L.)

Characteristic of entomopathogenic fungus to Tetranychus kanzawai was investigated. Three selected isolates of Metarhizium aniopliae, from Philippines and Indonesia were evaluated. The following aspects were investigated: (1) Bioassay tes of virulence, (2) Koch Postulate and (3) Infection process on each fungus against mite. Virulence of Metarhizium anisopliae was 1.4 × 103, 7.2 × 102, 5 × 102 PIB per ml on Ma4, Ma5 and Ma6, respectively. On Koch Postulates, Reinoculation and reisolation of all seven isolates from infected T. kanzawai showed definite signs of infection. This demonstrated its entomopathogenic capacity. In this experiment, adult mites were sprayed with 108 per ml concentrations of conidia observed under light microscope and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The result found T. kanzawai was very susceptible to three isolates M. anisopliae. In the end of the trials, fungal growth was detectable as early as 2 until 4 days of observation. Infection process withmicrophotograph and Scanning Electro Microscopy showed attachment, germination and penetration, extrusion and conidiogenesis fungal form.","Infection; Light microscopy and scanning electro microspopy (SEM); Metarhizium anisopliae; Tetranychus kanzawai",,,,,,,,,,,"Alves, S.B., Rossi, L.S., Lopes, R., Tamai, M.A., Pereira, R.M., Beauveria bassiana yeast phase on agar medium and its pathogenicity against Diatraea saccharalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) and Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae) (2004) Biological Control, 30, pp. 165-173; Barreto, R.S., Marques, E.J., Gondim Jr., M.G.C., de Oliveir, J.V., Selection of Beauveria bassiana (Bals.)

The Improvement of tolerant rice cultivar to iron toxicity requires the information of some genetics parameters related to selected characters. This study was aimed to estimate gene action and heritability of the grain yield and its component under iron-toxic stress and control field conditions in rice. The iron-toxic tolerant rice cultivars, Pokkali and Mahsuri were crossed with the sensitive cultivar, Inpara5 to develop six generation populations. The breeding materials were grown in the iron toxicity site and control in Taman Bogo, Lampung Indonesia in the wet season from December 2013 to March 2014. The sensitive parent and BC1P1 had lower stress tolerance index (STI) compared to the tolerant parent F1, F2 and BC1P2. The grain yield and its component were fitted to the best model in five parameters which were more prominent with interactive epistasis of duplicate and complementary gene action. The heritability’s under control were more higher compared to iron toxicity stress condition. Delaying selection to later generations and combining with the shuttle breeding between stressed and controlled environments were the best strategy for improving the grain yield and tolerance to iron toxicity in rice. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Agroforestry systems that have been implemented should be reviewed to determine their effectiveness in improving soil fertility using a soil quality index. The varieties of soybean that cultivated in the study site were Grobogan, Kaba, and Argomulyo. The variables of this study consists of organic-C, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), total-N, available-P, available-K, Na, Ca, Mg, base saturation, and electrical conductivity (EC). Soil quality index calculation performed on selected outcome variables principal component analysis (PCA) which is then multiplied by the weights index on each PC. Selected variables from PCA consist of available-P, available-K, base saturation, and pH. Soil quality index values for all types of Agroforestry in the upstream of Bengawan Solo river basin (Wonogiri) is under secondary forest (<4.1) so that it can be concluded that the adoption of Agroforestry in the upstream of Bengawan Solo river basin has not effect on soil quality based on soil functions in the recycling of nutrients. Mean of soybean grain yield in agroforestry system are higher than the mean of national soybean production, but there are an obstacle such as light conditions. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The entrance tunnels, where the male beetles are staying, are short, with a mean 4 cm long and mostly incline upwards from outside to inside at an angle of around 20º. To examine the role of males, another male or female (as the invader) was placed into a tunnel. When inhabitant males stayed in the tunnel they quickly expelled the invaders, regardless of their sex of the invaders. However, when an inhabitant male was removed an introduced male or female could freely enter the tunnel and was accepted by the inhabitant female. Upon replacing an inhabitant male with an invader male or female and then putting another invader male or female into the tunnel, no rejection occurred, suggesting that invader males and females play no role in guarding the tunnel. Based on the results an inhabitant male seems to have three responsibilities; protection of the gallery from invaders, protection of progeny (larva) from falling down and also keeping the gallery clean from frass. The 20º angle of the entrance tunnel tends to aid both in gallery protection and in frass clearing. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Dioscorea is also an important crop which serves as a staple food and medicine. Discoreaceae exploration collecting mission had been conducted in 10 Districts of Pasuruan, East Java. Forty-four accessions were obtained during the exploration. It comprised of 5 species and 29 varieties i.e. 17 varieties of Dioscorea alata L., 8 varieties of Dioscorea his-pida Dennst., 2 varieties of Dioscorea esculenta (Lour.) Burkill., 1 variety of Dioscorea pentaphylla L. and 1 variety of Dioscorea bulbifera L. The results showed that morphological characteristic features of Dioscorea spp. tubers were broadly varied among species and even within varieties at the same species. Dioscorea spp. varieties originated from Pasuruan were mostly characterized by its tuber shape, tuber flesh colour, outer and inner skin colour and tubers skin texture. Based on the interviews to local farmers, D. alata and D. hispida varieties were still widely grown because of its high tuber yields and its most acceptable taste than other Dioscorea species. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The population consisted of 8 genotypes from Australia, 7 from Africa, 10 from America, and 13 from Asia. Genetic similarity was ranging from 17% to 97%, with the average of 57%. UPGMA dendrograms divided the population into three major groups i.e. group 1, 2, and 3 which consisted of 23, 10, and 5 genotypes, respectively. Each major group comprised genotypes of different geographical origins. The dendrogram divided each group into some subgroups. There were 8 subgroups i.e. 4 subgroups in group 1, 2 subgroups in group 2, and 2 subgroups in group 3. Some genotypes of same geographical origin were clustered into in at least 3 different subgroups, meaning that they were genetically dissimilar. On the other hand, some other genotypes of different geographical origin were clustered into the same subgroup, meaning that they were genetically similar. This data would help sugarcane breeders to select parents for hybridization in order to maximize heterosis. This could be conducted by selecting parents of dissimilar genotypes. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The experimental set up was subjected to drought stress after five weeks of planting for three weeks before data on morphological and yield characters of maize genotypes were obtained for three cropping years. Plant height and grain yield of Bodija yellow maize were the highest overall. There was a significant difference among genotypes for drought stress resistance and Bodija yellow maize showed the most tolerance, while TZBR Comp 1-C1 S2 510 genotype was the least. First principal component axis (Prin 1) had the highest contribution to the variation of the morphological, yield and drought tolerance traits. Prin 1 was highly related to the morphological and yield characters more than to the drought resistance. Plant height was negatively and strongly correlated (p<0.01) with stem height, number of leaves, stem girth, leaf length, leaf width and week after planting, but negatively correlated with the drought resistance. Therefore, Bodija yellow maize should be considered as parent material in breeding for the development of drought tolerant traits in maize. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

That natural diversity can be improved through induced mutation. Selected characters can be observed since the germination phases, which may also indicate the plants survival under field conditions. Experimental design was arranged in split plot, with cultivars as main plot and mutagen doses as sub plot. The experiment consisted of 36 treatment combinations, with each treatment consisting of 10 replications. Data were recorded on percentage of first count, final count and germination rate. The data were analyzed using F-test by SAS 9.0 and mean separation was carried out by employing DMRT at 95% (α = 5%) of confidence level. The results showed that the best cultivar response for germination traits was Inpari 13, the best mutagen to build cultivar for germination traits was Gamma 150 Gy, and the best combination between cultivar and mutagen for germination traits was Inpago Unsoed 1 that was treated with Gamma 150 Gy. © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

This research used 36 rice genotypes in M1 generation that were grown hydrophonically under drought stress level of -0.03 MPa. The identifications were conducted based on peroxidase isozyme marker. The isozyme patterns in zymogram were binary-coded by visual scores for each genotype, based on the thickness and the number in the appearance of bands on certain migration distance. The migration distances were measured based on values of Rf. The similarity coefficients were calculated using Dice’s coefficient that were used to construct dendrogram using the UPGMA employing the SAHN from the NTSYSpc 2.02. The results showed that the most resistant genotype under drought stress was R-4, and the genetic relationships among the genotypes were divided into two main groups, aromatic and non-aromatic group, in which some genotypes experienced the reduced levels of aromatic character (R-8 and R-9) and the drought resistance character (IU-2, IU-3, IU-4, IU-5, IU-6, IU-7, and IU-8), but there were some genotypes that were able to improve the resistance under drought stress (R-2, R-3, R-5, R-6, R-7, IT-4, IT-5, and IT-7). © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The study was conducted in Landasan Ulin rural, Gambut district, Banjar regency, South Kalimantan. The study was conducted from June to October 2012. Research was arranged in a randomized block design, with three replications. The treatment given was a combination of the type and dose of ameliorant i.e. the 3 types of ameliorant: F1 (50% purun tikus grass + 50% agricultural weed), F2 (16.7% chicken manure + 83.3% biochar), F3 (9% chicken manure + 91% purun tikus grass), with a dose of 2.5, 5 and 7.5 t ha-1, and control. The results showed that treatment of biochar could increase soil pH, total N, and exchangeable P (Bray I) though it was not significant, and significant in increasing the exchangeable K compared to controls.

AMF association also influence soil fertility through the enhancement of chemical, biological and physical content. In this study, we enumerated AMF spores from rhizosphere of Tithonia difersivolia as an indicator of soil fertility. The results showed that the most fertile soil had the highest AMF spores density. This research has confirmed that AMF has high interaction with organic carbon, organic matter, total phosphorus, cation exchange capacity, water level, soil fungi and soil bacteria. Partial regression analysis revealed the mathematic equation for their interaction. This equation used the abundant of AMF spores as an indicator for chemical, biological and physical fertility of the soil.","Arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF); Indicator; Soil fertility; Tithonia difersivolia","Arbuscular; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi",,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, L.K., Murphy, D.V., What is Soil Biological Fertility?

Morphological and molecular phylogenetic data confirmed the species as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. The pathogenicity of the isolate was also confirmed by detached leaf method which inoculated the virulent isolate into coffee leaves. The crude extracts with hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol solvents from Chaetomium cupreum CC3003 resulted significantly inhibited C. gloeosporioides that the ED50 values of 13, 11 and 28 ppm, respectively. The bioactive substances of C. cupreum CC3003 expressed antifungal activity against C. gloeosporioides as can be seen in the abnormal appearance of spores. A powder bio-formulation of C. cupreum significantly resulted to reduce anthracnose disease of 54.77 %. The application of nano-rotiorinol, nano-trichotoxin and a spore suspension of C. cupreum reduced anthracnose incidence of 46.23, 42.71 and 18.59 %, respectively while the inoculated control had high anthracnose disease.

The study was undertaken to assess the variability in morpho-physiological characters, tuber yield and starch content of 23 arrowroot populations in Garut District, West Java. The result showed some significant differences in morpho-physiological characteristics, tuber yield and starch content. Growth characteristics revealed that Cilawu population recorded the highest values for some characters: high, leaf number, above-growth biomass and tuber biomass. Cikajang population showed the highest tuber yield (210.6 g per plant) followed by Cilawu population (134 g per plant). Cikajang and Cilawu populations also provided the highest tuber biomass, 46.6 g and 60.0 g respectively. Cilawu population was a second population producing the highest starch content (26.1 %) after Cibatu population (27 %). The higher heritability coupled with genetic advance revealed for fresh tuber yield indicated that selection on basis of the character may be helpful to improve arrowroot yield. Most of the growth characteristics had not significant correlation indicating that the characteristics are not good indicator for selection.

The research aimed to study the land productivity improvement of Vertisol rice field by controlling the sulfur nutrient. The study was conducted in Dawu, Paron, and Guyung, Gerih, Ngawi, East Java, Indonesia, during the dry season 2013 and 2014. A randomized complete block design, with eight treatments and three replications were applied. The treatments were some rates of S-fertilizer application combined with in situ straw compost, ZA and Kieserit. Experimental plots dimension is 6 m x 5 m. Ciherang and Membramo were rice varieties grown in legowo 2:1 system. The results showed that S-fertilizer application can increase the weight of dry grain harvest and dry grain milled. The optimum doses of S-fertilizer were 24 kg S ha-1. Kieserit application resulted in less grain yield than ZA. Manure can increase the weight of dry grain harvest and tend to increase the weight of dry milled grain compared to those of the control treatments. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The survey-based research was conducted during March-May 2014 in Menggoran Forest Resort, Playen Forest Section, Yogyakarta Forest Management District. Stratified random sampling method was used during the research by stratifying the types of soil stratification, rainfall and declivity then was made into 7 land mapping unit (LMU) with map overlay technique. Agronomic characters of soybean were observed at 12 weeks after planting (wap) and the physiological data were observed during the maximum vegetative phase (8 wap). Agronomic and physiological characters of soybean in each LMU were grouped and statistically tested with analysis of variance then continued with orthogonal contras (alpha 5 %). The results showed that some characters of soybean planted on alfisol had higher value than on vertisol, especially on leaf area, photosynthetic rate, root and canopy weight, 100 grain weight and grain weight per plant. The agronomic and physiological characters of soybean which had significant effects on yield in the intercropping with kayu putih system were stomatal density, stomatal conductivity, photosynthetic rate, and leaf area. Soybean intercropped with kayu putih produced 1.007 t ha-1 in alfisol and 0.996 t ha-1 in vertisol. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

This study was conducted to obtain the phytochemical content and antioxidant assay in flesh, seed and pericarp extracts from the fruit of Selekop. Phytochemical analysis was conducted on ethanol extract for identification of flavonoid, alkaloid, tannin, saponin, triterpenoid and steroid. The antioxidant activity was done by DPPH assay with ascorbic acid as positive control. The flesh contained flavonoid, saponin, and tannin; the seed contained flavonoid, alkaloid, saponin, triterpenoid, and tannin; and the pericarp contained flavonoid, alkaloid, saponin, triterpenoid, and tannin. Analysis of antioxidant activity revealed the following Inhibitory Concentration (IC50 values): 122.51 ppm of flesh, 63.30 ppm of seed, 53.21 ppm of pericarp and 3.06 ppm of ascorbic acid. Based on these results, the ethanol extract of the seed and the flesh had a phytochemical content and antioxidant activity which was better than the flesh extract from Selekop fuit. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

This research objective was to evaluate the selection strategy of drought tolerant on red rice. The study was conducted on Ultisol soil in Bangka Belitung Province, Indonesia, in February 2012-February 2015. It consisted of three activities, selection M5, evaluation of selected M5 and evaluation of drought critical period on selected M6. Mutant of M5 was selected and evaluated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) -0.5 MPa and less of soil moisture. Selected M6 was evaluated to observe a critical period of drought stress. Eval-uation with PEG produces five superior mutants that more vigor than the elders. Selection on low humidity shows that M5-GR150-1-9 produces higher filled grain and weight filled grain than other mutants and elders. The selected red rice line M5-GR150-1-9-13, has a better tolerance towards drought than its control. It could be obtained such mutant lines which have a high yield, early maturing and drought tolerant from the result of six generations gamma irradiation mutant selection. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

This is the first report of brown leaf spot on rice in Cambodia. All isolates were tested for pathogenicity. Dual culture antagonistic tests showed that Chaetomium cupreum inhibited sporulation of C. lunata when compared to the control. In a pot experiment, C. cupreum significantly reduced the incidence of brown leaf spot caused by C. lunata. After application of a spore suspension of C. cupreum, Chaetomium-biofungicide and chemical fungicide (tebuconazole) to rice seedlings inoculated with C. lunata, the disease was reduced by 68.79 %, 75.80 % and 72.41 %, respectively. In a field trial, the chemical method gave the best results in all plant parameters, followed by the good agricultural practice (GAP) and organic methods. The chemical method gave the highest panicle/plant, panicle length, panicle weight, grain weight/plant which were different from the GAP and organic methods. The chemical method also gave the best results in filled grain panicle-1, unfilled grain panicle-1, grain weight plot-1, dry hay weight plot-1, biomass weight plot-1 and harvest index, and was significantly better than the GAP and organic methods. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

A field trial was undertaken to evaluate the insecticidal potency of Bridelia micrantha and Dalbergia lactea for the management of Podagrica uniforma (Jacoby) and Nisotra dilecta (Jacoby) insect pest of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L. Moench). The treatments consisted of aqueous leaf extracts of Bridelia micrantha and Dalbergia lactea and Cypermethrin as check; laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design and repli-cated three times. Data was collected on insect population before treatment application and 3 days after spraying of insecticides at 28, 35, 42, 56 days after planting (DAP). Yield parameters data collected were number of fruits and fruit weight. Results obtained showed that the plant extracts exhibited effectiveness in reducing the insect population and improved okra fruit yield compared to Cypermethrin. The order of effectiveness in decreasing sequence was found to be Cypermethrin ˃ D. lacteal ˃ B. micrantha. D. lacteal and B. micrantha crude extracts could be explored as promising insecticidal agents to provide valuable alternatives to chemical control of insect infestation on okra.

The level of drought influence on several growth parameters of vegetative plant and thus affected to seeds production as well as on total yield. The results show that the introduced-variety of wheat line, SO3 shows the significant tolerant to drought and able to maintain the SRL (specific root length) and increase the proline contents to with stand the drought condition compare to other lines (M7 and M8). The proline as amino acid climbed extremely effected by drought, in contrast the root growth in particular their length reduced. Those plant conditions influence the plant vegetative growth and generative phases, especially for seed production. Additionally, the M8 and SO3 selected-line presents the stability on yield production compare to other varieties, since it able maintain the content of proline and ratio of root length.

The studies were conducted into three phases of activities, namely: sampling and collection of infected leaves from the representative rice growing areas; isolation and purification of the Xoo isolates; and evaluation of composition and pathotype of Xoo on five rice differential varieties. Results indicated that a total of 2,658 isolates Xoo have been isolated from 10 provinces representing rice ecosystem in Indonesia during the growing season from 2010-2013. Evaluating these Xoo isolates against five differential varieties revealed that these Xoo isolates consisted of three pathotypes III, IV, and VIII with a total of 30, 36, and 34%, respectively. The data also indicated that two pathotypes III and IV were dominant in three provinces, while the pathotype VIII was dominant in four provinces. As mentioned previously, such information are useful in designing strategy of integrating components of technologies combined in the management of Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) occurrences in a particular endemic areas. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The land productivity in AF system by villagers is mostly low because of inappropriate AF practice. The objective of this research is to analyze the land management practice in Menoreh hills, Kulon Progo, Yogyakarta. The study was conducted in Giripurwo Village, Kulon Progo. Stratifed sampling with purposive sampling was used in this study. Total of twelve plots were determined in every AF levels. Studies conducted in every plot includes the species composition and soil fertillity. The results showed that: (1) Tree composition in early and middle AF is dominated by woody tree (Sengon), while in advance AF is dominated by non-timber forest product (clove), (2) Low soil fertility in the study area is caused by high intensity of biomass harvesting and low fertilization dosage applied, (3) The increment of land productivity could be achieved by increasing the biomass input to the soil from organic fertilizer and crop waste. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Genetic exploration of lai is important to support its breeding program. According to rapid development in molecular biology, genetic exploration effort of lai will be easier. One of significant step in any molecular biology activities is DNA isolation to produce high quality DNA for further analysis. Leaves of lai, as other perennial crop, contain of high concen-tration of polysaccharides and polyphenol which will be co-extracted with the DNA. These compounds can interfere enzymes activities in subsequent molecular analysis. The aim of this study was to establish an optimal and effective DNA extraction method to obtain high-quality DNA from mature leaf of lai. An established extraction buffer and its modification were used in this study. The result showed that modification 4 could produce high quality DNA, and was considered to be the most effective DNA extraction method for mature leaf of lai. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Soil acidity and Al toxicity are often fixed by liming. The research aimed to determine the calculation method of lime requirement and its application method for soybean on tidal land. The research was conducted on tidal land in South Kalimantan, Indonesia. Treatment consisted of two factors and arranged in randomize complete block design, replicated three times. The first factor was the method of lime rate calculation: (1) no liming,(2) liming based on10% of Al saturation, (3) liming based on 20% of Al saturation, (4) liming based on 30% of Al saturation, (5) liming based on 0.5 x exchangeable Al, and (6) liming based on 1 x exchangeable Al. The second factor was the method of application: (1) surface,and (2) mixed within 20 cm soil depth. The results showed that liming by mixing dolomite with soil within 20 cm depth resulted in 8% higher plant height compared to that applied on the soil surface. The highest yield was obtained when liming at rate equivalent to 10% of Al saturation was mixed with soil within 20 cm depth. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Replicated yield trials were conducted to study the stability of hybrid rice yield and identify the best location to optimize their yield per ha. We have conducted the trials in three location such as Sukamandi, Salatiga and Malang during two seasons in 2011. We are analyzing data across location and season using AMMI and Eberhart Russel methods. The AMMI analysis showed that the IR79156A/PK88 was adaptable to favorable environments but unstable. This hybrid is always performing well and produce the higher yield compare to check variety. Some of other hybrids were good only in specific location, i.e. IR62829A/BP2280-1E-12-22 and IR58029A/BP2 280-1E-12-22. Those hybrids produced higher yield in Salatiga and Malang, respectively. Seem to AMMI analysis, the result of Eberhart and Russells method also showed that IR79156A/PK81 was the best hybrid with regression slope (b) around 1 with the yield average higher than average of all hybrids. It indicated that this hybrid has a wide adaptation and probably can be cultivated in the wider ecosystem. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Fertilization strategy is one of the efforts to increase rice crop growth and production on flooded condition. The objective of this research was to determine the best fertilization strategy on vegetative stage related to rice crop growth and production under flooded condition at two types of lowland swamp. The experimental design used in this research was split-plot design with three replications. The main plot was fertilization treatment consisting of P1= base fertilization, P2= fertilization before flooded, P3= fertilization after flooded and P4= fertilization before and after flooded. The subplot was rice variety which consisted of V1= Inpara 3, V2= Inpara 5, V3= IR 64 and V4= Ciherang. The results showed that fertilization strategy was capable of increasing rice crop growth and production under flooded condition at two types of lowland swamp. Rice variety Inpara 5 added with fertilizer before flooded on shallow-backswamp and fertilizer addition before and after flooded on middle-backswamp was the best treatment that had produced rice yield with magnitude of 4.48 and 3.43 ton per hectare, respectively. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Pummelo contains higher antioxidants thus beneficial for health. This research aimed to get information of physical and chemical quality differences, antioxidant capacity, and explain the relationship between fruit quality and antioxidant capacity of selected seeded pummelo cultivars. Fruit was harvested in Banyuwangi and Magetan while fruit quality assesment was conducted in Laboratory of Agronomy and Horticulture Department, IPB. The results showed that physical qualities of fruit (weight loss, peel softness and peel color) and chemical qualities (total soluble solids and total titratable acidity) were changed during storage. Adas Nambangan and Banyuwangi cultivars have better physical and chemical qualities than other cultivars during storage until 10 weeks after harvest because of good visual appearance, the lowest decreased in weight loss and the good ratio of TSS:TTA. Seeded pummelo cultivars with dark red to reddish white fruit pulp had significant higher total phenolic, carotenoid, anthocyanin and antioxidant capacity than white fruit pulp. There were negative correlations between antioxidant capacity with colored pulp and total phenolic content. Banyuwangi had the highest antioxidant capacity in the pulp, followed by Bali Merah, Adas Nambangan, Pamelo Magetan, Srinyonya, Bali Putih cultivars. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Till today, there have not been effective and efficient control methods for such fungi. Recently, scientists agree that application of biological agents is a tactful choice. Development of hypovirulent strains of fungus as biocontrol agents is very limited. This research was aimed to find hypovirulent isolates of Fusarium from field as biological agents. A hundred isolates of Fusarium from chili were collected in Boyolali, Central Java. Morphological characterization revealed that isolates performed varied colony phenotypes. Based on colony phenotype pattern, isolates were classified into five groups. From each group, one hypovirulent isolate was selected based on colony growth rate on potato dextrose agar media. The selected hypovirulent isolates were used for virulence assay in apple. The result showed that there were four hypovirulent isolates i.e.: B6, C15, D19, and E20 isolates. Total RNA extraction of the identified hypovirulent isolates revealed the existence of viral RNA in C15 isolate. Based on the existence of viral RNA in C15 isolate, the hypovirulent traits were due to mycoviral infection, whereas the hypovirulent traits performed by the other three were due to genetic factors. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The study was conducted to assess the impact of brick kiln operation to the degradation of topsoil quality at Singair of Kalihati upazila in Tangail, Bangladesh, during the period of July to December 2013. The Soil was collected from areas close to the brick fields and far from the brick fields at a depth of 0-15 cm. The Electrical Con-ductance (EC) was found almost double in the soil samples close to the brick field than the soil samples far from brick field. The organic mattter content in the soil sample close to the brickfield was significantly lower than that of the far soil sample. The mean values of total N, available P and S were also significantly lower in the soil samples close to the brick kiln, 0.05%, 12.4, and 8.36 ppm respectively in the close soils, while 0.06%, 24.6, and 11.7 ppm respectively in the far soil.

The research was conducted in Bengkulu, Indonesia, from April to July 2014. Results showed that the number of weed species decreased after the trials from 14 to 13. There was a shift in weed compositions because 5 species of weeds did not emerge after the trials, but 4 new species were found. Chemical weed control used a herbiside mixture of atrazine and mesotrione applied during postemergence was the most effective method to control weeds, which was observed on decreased weed emergence and weed biomass down to 22.33 and 25.00 percent of control, respectively. Subsequently, biomass production of sweet corn increased up to 195.64 percent at the same trials. Biomass of weeds and sweet corn were also affected by the organic composts. Weed biomass was inhibited by treatment of composted empty fruith bunches of oil palm, whereas significantly increased of sweet corn biomass were observed in the plots of organic manure. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

In Central Bangka Regency, agarwood is the main commodity of forest. The research was aimed to determine the dynamic population of rhizobacteria and its potential as a biological control agent to control Fusarium disease in the nursery of agarwood (Aquailaria malaccensis Lamrk). The research was carried out by using exploration and identification methods. Sixty nine bacterial isolates were obtained from 20 samples. The samples taken were from Pangkalan Baru and Koba districts. After selection process, 49 bacterial isolates were tested for the capacity of inhibition. Results showed that 37.50 % of the bacterial isolates indicated a strong inhibition capacity, meanwhile 58.33% indicated a moderate and only 4.70% possessed a weak inhibition. Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. aeroginosa, P. malthophilia and Klebsiella pnemoniae were identified from the selected isolates. These bacteria were potentially able to protect plants against Fusarium disease and to promote plant growth. This research needed to be continued at the field level in order to know the real effects on plant. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Research was conducted on 76 roads to identify damage intensity of dying trees on sonokembang and clarify the causal agent of dying trees in Malang from May to December 2012. Seven variables was also investigated such as characteristic of tree`s damage, distribution of holes based on sunlight exposure, vertical position of stem, and stem diameter, morphological characteristic of beetle, the intensity of dying trees, and distribution of dying trees. Results showed that there were unique damaging characteristic such as dying and then fallen leaves, holes on the stem and branches, and frass production. Euplatypus parallelus Fabricius was identified as a causal agent of dying sonokembang. There were some indications shown such as beetles preferred to attack stem side with much sunlight exposure, upper stem and medium or bigger size of stem diameter. From 3,206 trees on 76 roads, 69.7% were found dying trees. In dry and rainy season, the intensity of dying trees increased from 8.14 to 9.76% and from 10.26 to 10.79%, respectively. © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

However, the complexity of acid soil may lead to low soybean productivity. Hence, soybean variety which is adaptive to acid soil is needed. The objective of this research was to find out expected lines adaptive to acid soil. A number of ten soybean lines and two check varieties were grown in Natar Research Station in dry season II, 2011. This research applied randomized completely block design with four replications. Results showed that 7 of 10 soybean lines had grain yield higher than those of two check varieties. The three lines with the highest grain yield were Tgm/Anj-957, Tgm/Anj-908 and Tgm/Anj-932 with grain yield 1.83, 1.74, and 1.65 t ha-1 respectively. Tanggamus variety had grain yield higher than Wilis. The highest grain yield line, Tgm/Anj-957, was also supported by the highest number of pods per plant up to 68 pod. Line of Tgm/Anj-995 was the line with the largest seed size, i.e. 16 g per 100 seeds. © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The crossing to produce F1 and BC1F1 was successful only when J. curcas was used as the female parent. The suitable time for crossing was between 08:00 – 13:00 o’clock with fruit setting rate of 65-78%. The F1 segregated into white- and pink-flowered plants. While flowers of the F2 population segregated into nine different colors, viz. light green, green, white, very light pink, light pink, pink, deep pink, very deep pink, and red. When J. curcas was backcrossed by a pink-flowered F1, its BC1F1 progenies segregated into green, light green, white, very light pink and light pink flowers. While another set of BC1F1 progenies obtained from a white-flowered F1 parent segregated into green, light green, and white. The segregating progenies in both sets showed smaller plants than jatropha and bore colorful flowers suitable for ornamental purpose. Six plants were chosen and registered at Kasetsart University and the Thai Department of Agriculture as commercial cultivars, ‘Kamphaeng Saen 1’ to ‘Kamphaeng Saen 6’. © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The purpose of this research was to develop such a model to fit the height growth of corn (Zea mays) plant given microbial combination of Ochrobactrum sp.and Bacillus megatirium treatment; besides, to compare the plant absolute growth rate model between plant with microbial and non microbial treatment. A simple sigmoid model was preffered as it is easier to interpret the parameters biologically. The result showed that Logistic model fitted better in describing the height growth compared to Gompertz model, as it yielded coefficient of determination more than 99%. This model showed that the maximum height growth rate happened in about 40 day after planting. Based on the model, it showed that the absolute growth rate tended to be bell-shaped and right-skewed for Logistic and Gompertz, respectively. © 2013, Universitas Brawijaya.","Corn; Gompertz; Height; Logistic; Microbe","Ochrobactrum; Zea mays",,,,,,,,,,"Amorim, L., Filho, A.B., Hau, B., Analysis of progress of sugarcane smut on different cultivars using functions of bouble sigmoid pattern (1993) The American Phytopathological Society, 83 (9), pp. 933-936; Bajpai, P.K., Priya, K., Malik, M., Selection of appropriate growth model for prediction of sugarcane area, production and productivity of India (2012) Sugar Tech.Dot, 7, p. 2012. , Access: May; Hunt, R., Growth analysis, individual plants (2003) Growth and development. people.exeter, p. 2012. , Ac.uk/rh203/EAPS_article.pdf, Access: April; Karadavut, U.C., Palta, K., Kokten, A., Bakoglu, A., Comparative study on some non-linear growth models for describing leaf growth of maize (2010) International Journal of Agriculture and Biology, , http://fspublishers.org, Access:October 2013; Larson, E., (2013) How to determine growth stages of young corn or sorghum, , http://www.mississippi-crops.com/2013/05/07/how-to-determine-growth-stages-of-young-corn-or-sorghum/, Access: No-vember, 2013; Kutner, M.H., Nachtsheim, C.J., Neter, J., (2004) Applied linear statistical models, , Fifth Edition.

One of the conditions from the forest authoritiesfor allowing agroforestry system is that it should maintain forest conditions. Since 1995 the Jangkok watershed has undergone rapid land use change, especially in the forest area. These changes led to a reduction of carbon stocks and thus to emission of CO2. This research aimed to: (1) Measure the carbon stocks in several land use system within the Jangkok watershed, (2) Assess the contribution of agroforestry systems in maintaining carbon stocks and reducing emissions. The assesment was performed based on the RaCSA (Rapid Carbon Stock Appraisal) method using three phases: (1) Classify land use change applying TM5 Landsat Satellite images for the period 1995-2009, (2) Measure carbon stock in the main land uses identified, (3) Quantify the contribution of agroforestry practices. Results showed that (1) The total amount of carbon stock at Jangkok watershed (19,088ha) was 3.69 Mt (193 Mg ha-1); about 23% of this stock found in the agroforestry systems (32% of the area),(2) Gross CO2 emission from the Jangkok watershed was 8.41 Mg ha-1 yr-1, but due to the net gain in agroforestry of 2.55 Mg ha-1 yr-1 the net emission became 5.86 Mg ha-1 yr-1.","Agroforestry; Carbon emission rate; Carbon stocks",,,,,,,,,,,"Cabezas, P.P., Nathaniel, K., Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD): Implications for the carbon market (2008) Environmental defense fund, p. 13; Chave, J., Andalo, C., Brown, S., Cairns, M.A., Chambers, J.Q., Eamus, D., Folster, H., Yamakura, T., Tree allometry and improved estimation of carbon stocks and balance in tropical forest (2005) Oecologia, 145, pp. 87-99; Corbera, E., Estrada, M., Brown, K., Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degra-dation in developing countries: Revisiting the assumptions (2010) Climatic Change, 100, pp. 355-388; Elverfeldt, C.S., (2010) Carbon finance possi-bilities for agriculture, forestry and other land use projects in a small-holder context, p. 23. , NRME Department, FAO; (2004) Adaptation to climate change in agriculture, forestry and fisheries: Perspective, framework and priorities, p. 26. , FAO; Glenda, J., Carbon storage and emissions offset potential in an Africa dry forest, the Arabuko-Sokoke forest, Kenya (2008) Environ Monit Assess., 142, pp. 85-95; Hairiah, K., Arifin, J., Prayogo, C., Widianto, Sunaryo, Prospects coffee-based agroforestry for carbon stocks (2002) Agro-teksos, 12 (2), pp. 145-150. , (in Indonesia); Hairiah, K., Rahayu, S., Berlian, Environmental services of coffee-based agroforestry: Carbon stocks in tree biomass and soil organic matter, case study in Sumberjaya, West Lampung (2006) J.

The characteristics of six land use systems in a total of 18 plots i.e.Primary Forest (PF), Disturbed Forest (DF), Mahogany-Woodlot (MW), Candle-nut-Agroforestry (CA), Multi strata Agroforestry (MA), and Simple-Agroforestry (SA) were analysed in this research. The species diversity level was measured using Shannon-Wiener index, while C-stocks were assessed according to the RaCSA method. Results showed that forest conversion to agricultural land uses reduced the number and density of tree species, average wood density and basal area. The PF represented the highest biodiversity index (3.46), while the other land uses were categorised as medium to low. The largest C-stock was found in PF and in MW, with the average of 550 Mgha-1, while the lowest was in SA (70 Mgha-1), with other land uses around 219 Mgha-1.The quantity of C-stocks was not related to species diversity, but closely related to wood density (R2=0.84), basal area of all sizes of tree (R2=0.86), and the basal area of trees diameter &gt;30 cm (R2=0.71). Based on the number and species density, MA and CA resembled the characteristics of DF and PF. © 2013, Universitas Brawijaya.","Agroforestry; Carbon stocks; Land use; Plant species diversity; Primary forest","Swietenia",,,,,,,,,,"Aerts, R., Honnay, O., Forest restoration, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (2011) BMC ecology, 11 (29), pp. 1-10; Barthlort, W., Mutke, J., Kier, G., BIOMAPS (2013) Biodiversity mapping for pro-tecttion and sustainable use of natural resources, , www.botanik.uni-bonn.de, 1999, Ac-cessed 13 May; Brearly, F.Q., Prajadinata, S., Kidd, P.S., Proctor, J., Suriantata, Structure and floristics of an old secondary forest in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia and a comparison with adjacent primary forest (2004) Elsevier, 195, pp. 385-397; Chapin, F.S., Zavaleta, E.S., Eviner, V.T., Naylor, R.L., Vitousek, P.M., Reynolda, H.L., Hooper, D.U., Diaz, S., Consequences of changing biodiversity (2000) Nature, 405, pp. 234-242; Chave, J., Andalo, C., Brown, S., Cairns, M.A., Chambers, J.Q., Eamus, D., Folster, H., Yamakura, T., Tree allometry and improved estimation of carbon stocks and balance in tropical forest (2005) Oecologia, 145, pp. 87-99; Hairiah, K., Rahayu, S., Berlian, Coffee-based agroforestry community service: Carbon stock in tree biomass and soil organic matter (case study conducted in Sumber-jaya, West Lampung) (in Indonesian) (2006) Agrivita, 28 (3), pp. 298-309; Hairiah, K., Ekadinata, A., Sari, R.R., Rahayu, S., Carbon stock measurement: From land use system to landscape (in Indonesian) (2011) Word Agroforestry Centre, p. 88; Hector, A., Bagchi, R., Biodiversity and ecosystem multi functionality (2007) Nature, 448, pp. 188-191; Indriyanto, Forest Ecology (in Indonesian) (2008) Bumi Aksara, p. 210; Kehlenbeck, K., Maass, B.L., Crop diversity and classification of homegardens in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia (2004) Agroforestry systems, 63, pp. 53-62; Kendom, M., Hairiah, K., Sudarto, Carbon emission estimate at East Casteel watershed based on the change of natural forest cover in Asmat Regency, Papua (in Indonesian) Universitas Brawijaya (2013) Thesis, p. 161; Kessler, M., Kessler, P.J.A., Gradstein, S.R., Bach, K., Schmull, Pitopang, R., Tree diversity in primary forest and different land use systems in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia (2005) Biodiversity and conservation, 14, pp. 547-560; Ketterings, Q.M., Coe, R., van Noordwijk, M., Ambagau, Y., Palm, C.A., Reducing uncertainty in the use of allometric biomass equations for predicting above-ground tree biomass in mixed secondary forests (2001) Elsevier, 146, pp. 199-209; Krisnawati, H., Adinugroho, W.C., Imanudin, R., Allometric monograph for tree biomass estimation in all types of forest ecosystem in Indonesia.

In order to effectively control the disease, detailed information on how the fungus infects seedlings of A. mangium and how the plant responds to the fungal infection is essentially needed. The objectives of this research were to investigate: (1) the infection process of F. oxysporumon seedlings of A. mangium, (2) the defence response of A. mangium seedling to infection by F. oxysporum. The fungal pathogen was identified, followed by performance of pathogenicity test. The infection process was followed by macroscopic observation as well as microscopic observation. The result indicated that fungal spore germination was observed at two-day post inoculation in planta. At four-day post inoculation, hyphae of F. oxysporum had penetrated the collar root of A. mangium seedling via stomata aperture. In addition, fungal hyphae had grown intercellulary into the vascular tissue. Correspondingly, hypersensitive response was also detected at the stomata aperture. However, this defence mechanism is not effective in stopping the fungus since F. oxysporum is a necrotropic pathogen. Moreover, accumulation of lignin, but not callose, was observed.","Acacia mangium; Damping-off; Fusarium oxysporum",,,,,,,,,,,"Achmad, S., Hadi, S., Harran, E.G., Sa'Id, B., Satiawihardja, Kardin, K., Attack mechanism of damping off pathogens of Pinus merkusii seedling (2012) Jurnal Silvikultur Tropika, 3 (1), pp. 57-64. , Abstract in English; Brockmann, B., Smit, R., Tudzynski, P., Characterization of an extracellular b-1,3-glucanase of Claviceps purpurea (1992) Physiology Molecular Plant Pathology, 40, pp. 191-201; Feys, B.J., Moisan, J.L., Mari-Anne, N., Parker, E.J., Direct Interaction between The Arabidopsis Disease Resistance Signaling Proteins, EDS1 and PAD4 (2001) The EMBO Journal, 20, pp. 5400-5411; Hadi, S., Forest Pathology (Patologi Hutan) (2001) Perkembangannya di Indonesia., , (in Indonesia).

Besides inhibiting growth and reducing yield, drought also causes alteration of the shoot and root growth and development. The objective of this study was to evaluate responses of common bean to three durations of drought stress and the bean ability to recover after termination of the stress treatments. Gradual drought stress treatments were imposed by withholding all water sources to the treated plants. Three durations of drought stress imposed were 4, 8, and 12 days. The ability of the stress-treated plants to recover was evaluated at 7 days after termination of each treatment. The result of this study revealed that common bean was able to tolerate and recover from gradual water deficit for up to 8 days; however, prolonged water deficit for 12 days inhibited the growth of above-ground organs in common bean. Despite root regrowth during the recovery period, plants previously treated with 12 days of drought were unable to recover but those treated with shorter drought stress period were able to recover. © 2018, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

This research aimed to describe the plant species diversity in traditional home gardens, identify the species with important value based on ethnobotanical indices, and describe the perception of local people towards agroforestry conservation in Osingnese Villages in Banyuwangi. Data acquisition was performed at Kopen Dukuh, Buluhsari-Kopen Cungking, and Kemiren Villages. Floristic survey was implemented at 75 home gardens. An interview was implemented for each owner. Results showed that Osingnese home gardens consist of numerous plant species. Kopen Dukuh and Buluhsari-Kopen Cungking showed a complex structure which could be considered as a complex agroforestry. Cocos nucifera, Coffea canephora, Coffea liberica, Garcinia mangostana, and Durio zibethinus were the important species in complex agroforestry. Those species composition indicated that home gardens are able to conserve native plants of Malaysian regions, particularly Indonesian flora. Agroforestry knowledge was derived from the older generations and implemented in gardening practices. They also argued that recent agroforestry is an adaptation mechanism of land management. The government did not contribute to educate and empower local people about agroforestry practices. © 2018, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Agricultural drought assessment has been used to monitor agricultural sustainability, particularly in East Java as national agricultural production center. Identification of drought characteristics-correlated with El Niño-Southern Oscillation, and agricultural impact on paddy fields and rice production using VHI (Vegetation Health Index) were conducted. VHI is produced by TCI (Temperature Condition Index) and VCI (Vegetation Condition Index) derived from MODIS satellite data, LST (Land Surface Temperature) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index), respectively. The results showed agricultural drought usually started in June, maximum in October and ended in November. Onset and end time drought tends to follow monsoonal rainfall pattern. El Niño 2015 showed long duration of agricultural drought (i.e. ± 5 months), high severity (i.e. mild-extreme drought; VHI 0-40) and areal extent of drought approx. 197,343 km2, while during La Niña 2010 the areal extent was approx. 28,685 km2 with mild-severe drought (VHI 10-40). Impact of agricultural drought on paddy fields showed wider (smaller) areal extent in sub-round 3 (sub-round 1) from September-December (January-April). Areal extent of drought was negatively correlated with rice production (r=-0.79) which significant in 99 % confidence level. © 2017 Universitas Brawijaya.","El Niño; La Niña; Rice production; Vegetation health index",,,,,,,,,,,"Aldrian, E., Susanto, R.D., Identification of three dominant rainfall regions within Indonesia and their relationship to sea surface temperature (2003) International Journal of Climatology, 23 (12), pp. 1435-1452. , http://doi.org/10.1002/joc.950; Bey, A., Pramudia, A., June, T., Amien, L.I., (2003) Analisis Anomali Iklim Dan Dampaknya Terhadap Ketersediaan Air Di Sentra Produksi Pangan Di Pulau Jawa [The Analysis of Climate and Its Impact on Water Availability in Food Production Centers, Java Island], , http://repository.ipb.ac.id/handle/123456789/5606, Bogor, ID: IPB.

Seventy eight sunflower RILs were grown in greenhouse and 100 sunflower RILs were grown under field condition, and measured some morphological and physiological traits including leaf area at flowering (LAf), net CO2 assimilation rate (A) and transpiration per day at flowering (Ef). WUE, called “potential” WUE (WUEp), was calculated as the ratio of assimilation potential (Ap) to transpiration per day at flowering (Ef) where Ap was derived from the multiplication of A with LAf. The CID was significantly varied among RILs and there was significant negative genetic correlation between CID and WUEp. Heritability of the CID was higher rather than the WUEp which reflected wide genetic variability of CID. The genetic correlation between CID and WUEp and the wide genotypic variability of CID indicated that CID can be proposed as an indicator to determine WUE in sunflower and open a way in understanding the genetic diversity of the RILs which could be used as a basic consideration before applying selection program in sunflower breeding. © 2017 Universitas Brawijaya.","CID; Genotypic variability; Sunflower; WUE",,,,,,,,,,,"Adiredjo, A.L., Navaud, O., Lamaze, T., Grieu, P., Leaf carbon isotope discrimination as an accurate indicator of water-use efficiency in sunflower genotypes subjected to five stable soil water contents (2014) Journal of Agronomy and Crop Science, 200 (6), pp. 416-424. , http://doi.org/10.1111/jac.12079; Adiredjo, A.L., Navaud, O., Muños, S., Langlade, N.B., Lamaze, T., Grieu, P., Genetic control of water use efficiency and leaf carbon isotope discrimination in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) subjected to two drought scenarios (2014) Plos One, 9 (7). , http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0101218; Åkesson, M., Bensch, S., Hasselquist, D., Tarka, M., Hansson, B., Akesson, M., Hansson, B., Estimating heritabilities and genetic correlations: Comparing the “animal model” with parent-offspring regression using data from a natural population (2008) Plos One, 3 (3), p. 1739. , http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0001739; Allinne, C., Maury, P., Sarrafi, A., Grieu, P., Genetic control of physiological traits associated to low temperature growth in sunflower under early sowing conditions (2009) Plant Science, 177 (4), pp. 349-359. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.07.002; Alza, J.O., Fernández-Martínez, J.M., Genetic analysis of yield and related traits in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) in dryland and irrigated environments (1997) Euphytica, 95 (2), pp. 243-251. , http://doi.org/10.1023/A:1003056500991; Anyia, A.O., Slaski, J., Nyachiro, J.M., Archambault, D.J., Juskiw, P., Relationship of carbon isotope discrimination to water use efficiency and productivity of barley under field and greenhouse conditions (2007) Journal of Agronomy and Crop Science, 193, pp. 313-323. , http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-037X.2007.00274.x; Barbour, M.M., Warren, C.R., Farquhar, G.D., Forrester, G., Brown, H., Variability in mesophyll conductance between barley genotypes, and effects on transpiration efficiency and carbon isotope discrimination.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the production performance of Cilembu sweet potatoes in term of production classes and critical limit and to determine discriminating land characteristics classes of yield and total sugar content. This study was conducted in Cilembu sweet potatoes production centers in West Java. Sweet potatoes tuber and soil samples were collected by purposive random sampling during harvest. Cilembu sweet potatoes production classes were defined by decreasing yields criteria in land evaluation. Critical limit production was the lowest yield and total sugar content of raw tuber which harvested in Cilembu village. Discriminating land characteristics were decided by discriminant analysis. Results showed that there was a significant different yield between typical and nontypical areas. Critical limit of yield and total sugar content were 10.5 t ha-1 and 2.32 %, respectively. The discriminating land characteristics of yield classes were soil properties (pH, CEC, P, Ca, Mg, ΔT), and monthly rainfall, whereas for total sugar content classes were effective soil depth, clay, sand and monthly rainfall. These variables are proposed as diagnostic criteria in Cilembu sweet potato land suitability criteria. © 2017 Universitas Brawijaya.","Discriminating land characteristic; Land suitability criteria; Sugar content; Sweet potato; Yield",,,,,,"Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Ministry of Science and Technology","The authors gratefully thank to the DGHE, Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher",,,,"Antisari, L.V., Nobili, M.D., Ferronato, C., Natale, M., Pellegrini, E., Vianello, G., Hydromorphic to subaqueous soils transitions in the central Grado lagoon (Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy) (2016) Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, 173 (2016), pp. 39-48. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2016.02.004; Beegle, D., Chapter 14.

To improve the seed germination, seed priming technique was assessed in this study. Seed of three upland rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties (Leum Pua, ULR038 and Sakon Nakhon1, SKN) were primed with three different seed priming agents; distilled water, CaCl2 and 300-fold diluted wood vinegar. Compared to untreated dry seeds, wood vinegar improved field emergence and improved drought tolerance of the rice seeds better than other priming agents, which 50% for Leum Pua, 20% for ULR038 and 16% for SKN, when watering was delayed for 7 days. All three priming agents increased the field emergence percentage by similar amounts when watering was delayed for 14 days. To understand how priming helped improvement of germination, antioxidation mechanism and sugar metabolism were examined. Level of malondialdehyde was markedly reduced in all three rice varieties in response to priming, which were associated with increased activity of antioxidant enzymes, guaiacol peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase. Wood vinegar also accelerated amylase activity in ULR038 and SKN, but not the sugar content. The results suggest that wood vinegar is a potent priming agent for achieving rapid and uniform seed germination in upland rice. © 2018 Universitas Brawijaya.","Biochemical changes; Drought; Oryza sativa; Plant derived smoke; Seed priming",,,,,,,"This research was supported by the Higher",,,,"Abdallah, E.H., Musa, Y., Mustafa, M., Sjahril, R., Riadi, M., Comparison between hydro and osmo-priming to determine period needed for priming indicator and its effect on germination percentage of aerobic rice cultivars (Oryza sativa L.)

Endophytic fungi has the potency to suppress plant diseases by acting as induced resistant agent. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of endophytic fungi application on incidence of yellow leaf curl disease of chilli pepper. Four isolates of endophytic fungi, i.e. Cercospora nicotianae isolate H5, Curvularia sp. isolate H12, Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 and AC-4.5 were applied as seed treatment and leaf spray on 2 chilli varieties, ‘Biola’ and ‘Luwes’. Observations of incubation period showed that delayed symptom occurred on application of Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 and Curvularia sp. isolate H12. Disease incidence reached 100% in all treatments. Less severe symptom was observed on application of Curvularia sp. isolate H12. Most plants infected by PYLCIV showed obvious symptoms of yellow mosaic, leaf curling and stunting. Plant productivity analysis showed that application of Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 resulted higher fruit weight and this treatment may induce tolerant response of the plants to PYLCIV infection. Initial effort to evaluate endophytic fungi as biocontrol agents for pepper yellow leaf curl disease should be studied further. © 2018 Universitas Brawijaya.","Cercospora nicotianae; Curvularia sp; Endophytic fungi; Fusarium sp; Pepper yellow leaf curl virus",,,,,,,,,,,"Achatz, B., Kogel, K.-H., Franken, P., Waller, F., Piriformospora indica mycorrhization increases grain yield by accelerating early development of barley plants (2010) Plant Signaling and Behavior, 5 (12), pp. 1685-1687. , http://doi.org/10.4161/psb.5.12.14112; Biswas, C., Dey, P., Satpathy, S., Satya, P., Establishment of the fungal entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana as a season long endophyte in jute (Corchorus olitorius) and its rapid detection using SCAR marker (2012) Biocontrol, 57 (4), pp. 565-571. , http://doi.org/10.1007/s10526-011-9424-0; Busby, P.E., Zimmerman, N., Weston, D.J., Jawdy, S.S., Houbraken, J., Newcombe, G., Leaf endophytes and Populus genotype affect severity of damage from the necrotrophic leaf pathogen, Drepanopeziza populi (2013) Ecosphere, 4 (10), p. 125. , http://doi.org/10.1890/ES13-00127.1; Crawford, K.M., Land, J.M., Rudgers, J.A., Fungal endophytes of native grasses decrease insect herbivore preference and performance (2010) Oecologia, 164 (2), pp. 431-444. , http://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-010-1685-2; Fakhro, A., Rade-Linares, D.R., Von Bargen, S., Bandte, M., Büttner, C., Grosch, R., Franken, P., Impact of Piriformospora indica ontomato growth and on interaction with fungal andviral pathogens (2010) Mycorrhiza, 20 (3), pp. 191-200. , http://doi.org/10.1007/s00572-009-0279-5; González-Teuber, M., Jiménez-Alemán, G.H., Boland, W., Foliar endophytic fungi as potentialprotectors from pathogens in myrmecophyticAcacia plants (2014) Communicative and Integrativebiology, 7 (5). , http://doi.org/10.4161/19420889.2014.970500; Hardoim, P.R., Van Overbeek, L.S., Berg, G., Pirttilä, A.M., Compant, S., Campisano, A., Sessitsch, A., The hidden world within plants:Ecological and evolutionary considerations fordefining functioning of microbial endophytes (2015) Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews, 79 (3), pp. 293-320. , http://doi.org/10.1128/MMBR.00050-14; Hipper, C., Brault, V., Ziegler-Graff, V., Revers, F., Viral and cellular factors involved in phloem transport of plant viruses (2013) Frontiers in Plant Science, 4, pp. 1-24. , http://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2013.00154; Hull, R., (2014) Plant Virology, , 5th ed.).

The research was conducted in smallholder oil palm plantations which were located in Jambi Province -Indonesia. Nutrient leaching was determined by measuring nutrient concentration in soil solution bi-weekly and monthly in the frond stacked and fertilized areas; soil water samples were collected by using suction cup lysimeter. The result showed that the application of mineral fertilizer (e.g. NPK) and dolomite resulted higher base saturation, exchangeable Ca, and available P in the fertilized than frond stacked and inter row areas (p ≤ 0.05). Stacking oil palm frond increased the soil macro-porosity, hence decreased leaching of K, Mg, Na, P, and total Al in the frond stacked than in the fertilized areas. The lower leaching losses and the higher soil macroporosity in the frond stacked than in the fertilized areas indicated that either the water did not dilute nutrient in the soil due to bypass flow, or the nutrient release from mineralization did not surpass nutrient demand which is quickly uptaken by palm root. Proper soil management through synchronizing rate of fertilizer application with nutrient output or frequency of fertilizer application may potentially minimize leaching losses. © 2018 Universitas Brawijaya.","Fertilization; Frond stacked; Nutrient leaching; Oil palm; Soil properties",,,,,,"023.04.2.414989/2014

Understorey is an important component of the homegarden community, but not a priority in its management because there is not much information about its benefits. Undestorey has several benefits such as food sources, food crops and medicinal materials. Research aimed to know the diversities of understorey species, the dominant of understorey species and the content of compounds in dominant understorey in the homegarden agroforestry system in Menoreh hill, Kulon Progo District. The study sites were categorized into 3 zones based on elevation, i.e. zone 1 (< 300 m above sea level (asl)), zone 2 (301-600 m asl) and zone 3 (> 600 m asl). This research method used inventory and identification of understorey species, and identification the content of dominant understorey compound by TLC method. The results showed that there were 41 species of understorey, the dominant species in zones 1, 2 and 3 were Curcuma mangga Val. Zone 3 produced the highest diversity. Based on the similarity index, there was a difference between the homegarden groups in zones 1, 2 and 3. Phenols and terpenoids were identified as in C. mangga. © 2018 Universitas Brawijaya.","Active compounds; Agroforestry; Homegarden; Understorey",,,,,,,"The research was funded by DPP Faculty of",,,,"Abebe, T., Sterck, F.J., Wiersum, K.F., Bongers, F., Diversity, composition and density of trees and shrubs in agroforestry homegardens in Southern Ethiopia (2013) Agroforestry Systems, 87 (6), pp. 1283-1293. , http://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-013-9637-6; Aguilar-Støen, M., Moe, S.R., Camargo-Ricalde, S.L., Home gardens sustain crop diversity and improve farm resilience in Candelaria Loxicha, Oaxaca, Mexico (2009) Human Ecology, 37 (1), pp. 55-77. , http://doi.org/10.1007/s10745-008-9197-y; Aires, A., Fernandes, C., Carvalho, R., Bennett, R.N., Saavedra, M.J., Rosa, E.A.S., Seasonal effects on bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity of six economically important Brassica vegetables (2011) Molecules, 16 (8), pp. 6816-6832. , http://doi.org/10.3390/molecules16086816; Asase, A., Tetteh, D.A., The role of complex agroforestry systems in the conservation of forest tree diversity and structure in southeastern Ghana (2010) Agroforestry Systems, 79 (3), pp. 355-368. , http://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-010-9311-1; Atangana, A., Khasa, D., Chang, S., Degrande, A., (2014) Tropical Agroforestry, , http://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-7723-1, Dordrecht:Springer; Chan, E.W.C., Lim, Y.Y., Wong, L.F., Lianto, F.S., Wong, S.K., Lim, K.K., Lim, T.Y., Antioxidant and tyrosinase inhibition properties of leaves and rhizomes of ginger species (2008) Food Chemistry, 109 (3), pp. 477-483. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.02.016; Chen, X.H., Zhuang, C.G., He, Y.F., Wang, L., Han, G.Q., Chen, C., He, H.Q., Photosynthesis, yield, and chemical composition of Tieguanyin tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.)

Soil samples were collected from each plant’s rhizosphere at three different locations of UniSZA Apiary, AGROPOLIS Research Farm and FBIM Teaching Farm at UniSZA, Besut Campus on May and November 2015. Enumeration of total bacteria by standard plate counts found that Acacia’s rhizosphere at AGROPOLIS Research Farm showed the highest CFU g-1 in November 2015 for aerobic (6.14 × 106) and anaerobic (3.97 × 106) bacteria. Acacia’s rhizosphere from UniSZA Apiary showed the highest CFU g-1 value in November 2015 for nitrogen fixing bacteria (aerobic; 1.87 × 106, anaerobic; 1.5 × 106) and phosphate solubilization bacteria (aerobic; 1.4 × 106, anaerobic; 1.41 × 106). The rainy season on November gave a higher bacterial CFU g-1 number (20-44 %) compared to the dry season on May for all different plants and locations. The finding showed that although BRIS soil is the problematic and unfertile soil, it has a large number of bacterial colony that might be beneficial to be exploited for enhancing plant growth and soil fertility. © 2017 Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The objectives of this study were to assess the genetic diversity and the population structure of PN'81 populations and the Wickham clones using 15 EST-SSR loci. Results of the analysis showed that the evaluated SSR primers yielded polymorphic markers. The gSSR 268 primer pairs yielded the most informative markers while HBE 280 primers generated the lowest ones. Results of the genetic diversity analysis supported that the PN'81 population belonged to a single large natural population of rubber trees while the Wickham clones belonged to a different group than that of PN'81. The population structure analysis of the rubber accessions was also in agreement with the results of the genetic diversity analysis. The experiment also indicated that PN'81 populations would be useful for future rubber breeding in Indonesia, especially as the sources of parent clones for rubber tree hybridization programs and rubber tree genetic resource conservation. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The availability of the marker is, however, very limited in durian. This research aimed to develop SSR markers from durian genomic library. Genomic DNA was isolated from durian shoot leaf, whilst SSR motifs were isolated using membrane-based oligonucleotide enrichment hybridization protocol. Annotation made on the library found 527 unique motifs from 354 durian libraries which form 425 loci. The SSR motifs obtained were generally short repeats which reached 89.6 %, whilst longer repeats were found consisted of compound motifs. Eleven loci were selected as representative for further test to prove their informativity. A number of unique allels were successfully amplified from 17 durian genomes. The analysis showed the polymorphic information content (PIC) values ranged from 0.000 to 0.662 with an average of 0.390. The SSR loci also showed their ability to be used for durian diversity analysis as the evident that the loci could be used as genetic markers for assisting further durian breeding program. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

This study was conducted to investigate the consequences of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas on post-harvest quality and shelf life of tomato fruits during the modified atmosphere packaging storage. Tomato fruits of light red maturity stage were harvested at Gangwon province in the Republic of Korea. Fruits were dipped in fungal suspension and, afterward, some of them were sterilized with NaOCl, while others were sterilized with ClO gas. On the final storage day, the 5 ppm ClO2 gas 12 hours treated tomato fruits showed the least carbon dioxide and ethylene, and the utmost oxygen concentration. The least fresh weight loss, prolonged shelf life and the most suppressed fungal incidence were obtained by the 5 ppm ClO2 gas 12 hours treatment. As compared to other treatments, the 5 ppm ClO2 gas 12 hours treatment yielded higher firmness, titratable acidity and vitamin C, and lower soluble solids. Therefore, the 5 ppm ClO2 gas 12 hours treatment may be useful to prevent fungal incidence as well as to retain the postharvest quality and increase the shelf life of tomato fruits. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Our research was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of these useful combinations with the carrying agent for growth promotion, thus lowering white rust incidence in chrysanthemum production. The experiment was carried out at three cooperative farmer sites located in Cipanas, Cianjur, West Java, Indonesia from January to December 2016. The production process was arranged in a paired treatment; a combination of PGPR and antagonist fungi (without supplemental chemical fertilizers and fungicide), furtherly called biofungicide and common farmer practices. The results showed that the application of biofungicide promoted equal plant growth quality as common practices. White rust incidency was lower at biofungicide treatment sites, thus increased the markertable flowers quantity. The production cost was considered more efficient in biofungicide sites, due to cheaper price of biofungicide than chemical fertilizers and fungicide. The increase of marketable stalks and cost efficiency led to an increase of net income of biofungicide based production as also viewed from higher Revenue Cost Ratio (R/C) than common farmer practices. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Currently, a problem encountered in the propagation of rubber planting materials is the availability of ideal soils with optimum nutrition as the planting medium. Peat can be used as a growing medium but it still has weaknesses such as high level of acidity and poor in nutrient content. This study was aimed to assess the performance of rubber budded stump grown on modified potting medium and applied with different forms and rates of fertilizers. The nursery experiment consisted of 17 treatments and arranged in a randomized complete block design. After rubber nursery stage, the performance of the rubber budded stump were also monitored in the field for 10 months. Results showed that mixture of peat and soil with the application of recommended rate of solid or liquid fertilizer produced rubber budded stump with bigger stem diameter and taller plants. The potting medium stimulated early root development which led to higher nutrient uptake. These budded stump also performed better in field, showed higher leaf nutrient concentration after 6 months and produced bigger stem diameter after 10 months. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Root supposed to play an important role on rice tolerance to submergence stress. An experiment which conducted from January to May 2014 in Cikarawang Field Laboratory, Darmaga, Bogor, West Java aimed to study the role of root distribution on rice submergence tolerant. The experiment used Split Plot design replicated three times, with the depth of submergence as main plot and rice variety as subplot. The main plot consisted of water depth of 5 (optimum), 50, 60 and 80 cm from soil surface. The subplot consisted of four rice varieties, namely Ciherang, Inpari 30 (Ciherang Sub1), Indragiri and Margasari. Each plant was planted in a root box (30 cm × 40 cm × 5 cm) which put into container (67 cm × 47 cm × 42 cm) and placed into the pond with water depth as treatment. Submergence started when the plant was 39 Days After Seeding (DAS) for ten days. Observation conducted after the submergence stopped (49 DAS). Result showed that submergence retarded plant growth, root distribution and increase root damage for all rice varieties with the biggest effect on susceptible varieties. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

These viruses are transmitted by green leaf hopper (Nephottetix virescens. Distant), and the interaction between host plant and the viruses were still quite difficult to be fully understood. In order to look at whether there are any differences between the healthy and tungro infected rice, this study was set to examine the character differences between the infected and the healthy plants based on isozyme banding pattern. The infected plants were collected from three districts around Surakarta (Sragen, Sukoharjo, Klaten) followed by Polyacrilamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE) to evaluate the isozyme banding patterns. There were peroxidase, esterase and acid phosphotase isozymes used. The results showed that the real differences of isozyme banding patterns of both healthy and tungro infected plants were discovered. In all cases, the Tungro infected rice had thicker and more band numbers compared to the healthy one. This evident suggested that Tungro infected rice could be detected early using PAGE method. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Laboratory experiment to study nitrogenase activity and IAA production of diazotroph from rice rhizosphere and to assess its effect on the growth of rice seedling has been conducted from September to October 2014 in Agronomy and Horticulture Laboratory Faculty of Agriculture Jenderal Soedirman University, Purwokerto. The exper-iment was arranged as a completely randomized design and consisted of seven treatments and provided with 4 replications. The treatments were the isolates of indegenous diazotroph (T1 = A11003, T2 = A230041, T3 = A24001, T4 = A230022, T5 = A230021, T6 = A230042 and T7 = without inoculation). The nitrogenase activity measured by acetylene reduction assay method and IAA production was measured by HPLC method. Plant height, leaf greeness, leaf area, total dry weight and total root length were determined on 21 days after sowing. The experimental results showed that the isolat A230021 was identified as Rhizobium sp. LM-5 and have the highest nitrogenase activity at 0.07 µM C2H4 ml-1 h-1 and IAA production reached 19.01 ppm.

However, detailed information on the way both respond to agroforestry management is lacking. Rubber and fruit tree agroforestry systems combine planted trees and trees that are tolerated or actively managed that derived from natural vegetation. The research aimed to evaluate plant species diversity, vegetation structure, and C stock in rubber agroforestry system (AF) and secondary forest grown in silty clay and sandy soils in Pulang Pisau Regency, Central Kalimantan province. A number of multistrata agroforestry systems was compared to the secondary (natural) forests (SNF) of the area; these included Fruit-Based Rubber Agroforestry (AFB) of about 100 years of age, Old Rubber Agroforestry (ARO) and Young Rubber Agroforestry (ARY). The highest C stock was found in AFB (415 Mg ha-1), while the average C stocks of other AF and SNF were 217 Mg ha-1. A plant diversity index (H’) was only weakly correlated to aboveground C stocks. Including the farmer-managed agroforests in schemes to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation is relevant, as their carbon stocks match or exceed those of remaining forests in the area. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Infected plants showed severe rot rapidly only in few days. An effort to control the bacteria was conducted by utilizing selected quorum quenching (QQ) inducer bacteria which produce AHL-lactonase by aiiA gene. The aims of this research were to screen and identify of quorum quenching bacteria, and also assayed their biocontrol potential ability against D. dadantii in laboratory. The screening of QQ bacteria was achieved using the anti-QS test, anti-microbial activity, and detection of aiiA gene using specific primer. The determination of the ability against D. dadantii was done using the soft rot assay on potato and orchid. Among thirty one bacteria isolates screened, four isolates (in succession namely B37, BT2, GG3, and GG6) were selected to control D. dadantii. All of these bacteria showed QQ ability to suppress the virulence of D. dadantii infection on orchids, significantly. Based on nucleotide sequences of 16S ribosomal RNA, those of bacteria isolates had the highest identity with Brevibacillus brevis, Bacillus cereus ATCC14579, Bacillus cereus ATCC14579 and Bacillus thuringiensis ATCC 10792. Brevibacillus brevis was reported for the first time as QQ bacteria in this study. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Several studies have shown that the use of carbohydrates as a carbon source plays a significant role in inducing somatic embryo development in certain plant species. This study aimed to establish a somatic embryo maturation protocol for Batu 55 Mandarin (C. reticulata Blanco.) by examining the effect of various types of sugar and concentrations. The results showed that the type and concentration of sugar added to the medium affect the somatic embryo maturation of Batu 55 Mandarin. Galactose and maltose enhance somatic embryo maturation more effectively than does sorbitol. The combination of galactose or maltose with sorbitol was able to improve somatic embryo maturation more effectively than galactose or maltose alone. The combination of galactose and sorbitol enhanced the maturation of somatic embryos more effectively than did change the concentrations of maltose or sorbitol. It can be concluded that sugar type and concentration had effects on citrus somatic embryo development. The combination of sorbitol (36.5 mM) with galactose 73 mM was able to augment citrus somatic embryo maturation more effectively than the other concentrations applied. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Breeding sesame is undertaken to increase production and is possible by radiation induced polygenic characteristic changes with a gamma rays source. The study aims to identify the effectiveness of genetic variability, standardized multiple linear regression, and principal component analysis to determine some important sesame yield components for indirect selection. Eighteen sesame mutant lines (black and white types) were studied for eleven quantitative traits. Two sesame types were irradiated with eight doses (100-800 Gy) of gamma rays individually. Variability studies on seed yield and yield components are important raw material of high productivity for all studied traits. Standardized multiple linear regression analysis is the most effective way to provide information of relationship between seed yield and yield components in sesame mutant lines for indirect selection. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Henn. is one devastated disease that could make significant economic loss in chrysanthemum production. The study of effects of varieties, cutting health and fungicide application on chrysanthemum white rust was established. The treatments were arranged in split-split plot completely randomized design with three replications. Three chrysanthemum varieties i.e. cv. Puma White, Reagent Purple and Town Talk served as main plot. Seedlings with 20 % intensity of white rust infection and symptomless functioned as sub plot, while fungicide application on the transplanted cutting (no fungicide) and dithiocarbamate (Antracol R 75 WP, 2 g L -1 ) application served as sub-sub plot. Result showed genetic background of the cultivars significantly determined the degree of infection of white rust. Reagent Purple exhibited least disease intensities. Fungicide application was less effective in controlling white rust development, yet gave significant impact on the plant height and number of leaves of chrysanthemum plants. Cuttings selection based on the visual observation on the presence or absence of white rust pustules symptom did not gave significant differences on the further development of the disease. The symptomless cuttings were also infected with this fungal disease after the cuttings were planted under plastic house. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

There were two blank plots that have been involved as representatives of indigenous fungal, that prepared as control (non-contaminated soil) and P1 (GP-contaminated soil) while the treatments were represented by two plots. Plot 2 (P2) was introduced with conidia suspension of Trichoderma viride strain FRP3 one time application, and plot 3 (P3) was introduced with conidia suspension of Trichoderma viride FRP3 two time applications. At the end of observation, the CFU of two times application was the highest with CFU of 15.97 x 10 6 gr -1 soil. The CFU of P3 was corresponding to 45% higher than P2 (8.83 x 10 6 gr -1 soil). The CFU of GP-contaminated soil without conidia suspension application had 0.66 x 10 6 gr -1 soils, only 0.7% and 0.4% corresponding to P2 and P3, respectively. Direct indicator of glyphosate degradation was determined using GC analysis. Within 7 days after Trichoderma viride FRP3 was introduced, glyphosate content of treated soil decreased. This fungal strain provided 48% (P2) and 70% (P3) of glyphosate degradation higher than indigenous soil microbial community (P1) within 28 days of application. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The grass compost (GC) was produced by Research Center for Biotechnology-LIPI. Whereas the spent oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) compost (OC) and spent paddy straw mushroom (Volvariella volvacea) compost (PC) were produced by Research Center for Biology-LIPI. Growing media of tomato seedling was a mixture of top soil (TS), rice husk charcoal (HC), grass compost (GC), spent oyster mushroom compost (OC) and spent paddy straw mushroom compost (PC) in the ratio of 1:1 as follows: TS+HC, TS+HC+GC, TS+HC+OC and TS+HC+PC. The experiments were arranged in Completely Randomized Design with three replications. Growth parameters observed i.e. seedling growth, dry weight production and leaf indices. Results showed that growing medium containing spent paddy straw mushroom compost was the best to improve seedlings growth in general. However, the lowest specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR) indices were obtained by the seedlings on the medium without compost. Correlation analysis showed that highest correlations were recorded for the TS+HC+OC medium. The tomato seedling growth was improved on the media containing compost in general. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The experiment aimed to estimate yields, biomass production and carbon dynamics of several management fertilization on maize farming practice on Ultisols has been conducted from March to July 2013 in Tamanbogo Experimental Farm, East Lampung. The experiment was set up as a randomized complete blockdesign, consisted of 6 treatments namely: 5 t ha-1 of cattle manure, 5 t ha-1 of dried sludge manure, and its combination with 200 kg urea ha-1 + 125 kg SP36 ha-1-1 + 50 kg KCl ha-1 (50% of recommended dose of inorganic fertilizers “RDIF”) and 75% of RDIF. The experimental results revealed that application of combined organic with inorganic fertilizers increased the biomass production, carbon fixation, and grain yield significantly. More than 50% of produced biomass and fixed carbon (grain, maize cob, maize husk, stems and leaves) were removed from maize farming. The use of organic fertilizer combined with NPK fertilizer at 50% of RDIF can be applied to increase the biomass production, organic carbon fixation and maize grain yield in sustainable ways. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Ten promising amphibious red rice lines were tested together with their three parents and one national cultivar (Aek Sibundong), during the rainy extended to dry season 2014 (January-June 2014). The ten promising lines were obtained from two population sources, while the three parents were AKBC52, AKBC86, and a local cultivar, i.e. Kala Isi Tolo (KIT). The testing environments were lowland in Mambalan village (West Lombok), medium highland in Mantang village (Central Lombok), and highland in East Sembalun village (East Lombok), and each location consisted of two systems, i.e. flooded and dry (upland) systems. The experiment in each environment was designed according to Randomized Complete Block Design, with three replications and 14 genotypes as the treatments. Adaptation analysis was based on ANOVA using AMMI and Biplot. The results indicated that among the 14 genotypes, G10(F2BC4A52-42) showed the highest yield, with an average of 7.8 t ha-1dry seeds. There was a significant Genotype x Environment interaction on the dry seed yield. Biplot analysis indicated that G2(F2BC4A52-44) and G8(F2BC4A52-37). © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Pod and seed number, and seed weight of individual lines were observed during harvesting time, and CER of randomly selected 32 F2 and 30 F3 lines was measured at initial seed filling stage. The selection of F2 lines based on pod number to generate F3 lines increased the average of seed yield by 39%, and pod number by 77% in F3 lines compared with F2 lines. A close relationships was found between seed weight and pod or seed number per plant. Net CER responded sensitively to a reduction of light in a short-term and showed 78% of F2 lines and all F3 lines with maximum CER (Pmax) ≥20 μmolCO2.m-2.s-1. The ratio of pod number per plant and Pmax varied between lines and were used to group lines resulting in close relationships between Pmax and pod number. It is concluded that the use of pod number and CER (Pmax) as selection criteria offers an alternative approach in soybean breeding for high yield. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

In 2012 and 2013, there were some dying trees of sonokembang along the road of Batu city, and there were some indications that the signs and symptoms might be related to the ambrosia beetle samples from Batu. To clarify the precise condition, identification of beetle samples was needed in this research. Based on survey and sample collections conducted in Batu from the early July 2013 to the end of March 2014, characteristic of damage on trees was observed together with the presence of beetle collected. Identification was based on morphological characters such as posterior elytral declivities and body size of male, and mycangia on female’s pronotum. Based on the morphological characters, there were some special characters which described such as 1) the body size of female adult was bigger than male adult, 2) elytral declivities on male adult was unique, and 2) there was mycangia on pronotum of female adults. Morphological char-acters showed that the ambrosia beetle attacked on sonokembang belonged to Treptoplatypus micrurus Schedl. This ambrosia beetle species seems to be the responsible agent that caused dying trees of sonokembang. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

High Fe content rice lines had been developed to overcome the problem. This study was aimed to explore the effect of genotype (G) and genotype × environment interaction (GEI) on yield of 21 high Fe content rice genotypes under 5 irrigated field environments. The research was conducted at DS 2011 in 2 locations and DS 2012 in 3 locations following randomized complete block design with three replications in each location. Combined analysis of variance showed genotype x environment interaction at 1% probability level, where G and GEI captured totally 88.8% of total variability. There were two Megaenvironments constructed, i.e. Mega-E1 that contained environments of trials in dry season 2011 (E4 and E5) with the winner of G12 (BP9474C-1-1-B) and Mega-E<inf>2</inf> that contained environments of trials in dry season 2012 (E1, E2, and E3) with the winner of G3 (A69-1). E1 (Subang, DS 2012), E2 (Karawang, DS 2012), and E3 (Indramaru, DS 2012) had good discriminativeness and representasiveness for yield trait of high Fe content rice lines. Mean performance and stability of genotypes indicated that G3 (A69-1; average 6.72 t ha-1) was highly stable with high yield. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The objective of the research was to investigate the effect of coconut water and / or tomato juice on the growth of protocorm of V. tricolor Lindl. var suavis from Bali grown in vitro. The experiment was laid out in the factorial design, with two factors (coconut water/CW and tomato juice/TJ), each contained three concentration (CW: 0, 100, and 200 cc L−1; TJ: 0, 100 and 200 g L−1) resulted in nine combination of treatments and replicated four times. The results showed that tomato juice with concentration of 100 gL−1 or 200 gL−1 promotes growth of protocorms of Vanda tricolor Lindl. var. suavis from Bali regardless the presence of coconut water. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

This research aimed to set an interaction model using multivariate analysis via smartPLS to identify environmental factors which simultaneously affects the growth of black rice. The growth of black rice in two irrigated organic paddy field in Malang, Indonesia was observed during planting period from November 2011 to March 2012. In each rice field, the growth was periodically recorded during planting periods: 19-29 days after planting (dap), 41-45 dap, 62-66 dap, 77-81 dap, 90-94 dap and 104-106 dap. Environmental factors such as water quantities, soil conditions, weed communities and cultivation system around the black rice population were also measured. Black rice growth was influenced simultaneously by water quantities, soil, weed communities and cultivating systems with predictive-relevance value reaching 92.83%. Based on the model, water quantities in paddy field is a key factor which directly and indirectly determined the growth and productivity of black rice. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The experiment used a Randomized Complete Block Design with 2 factors and 3 replications. Factor 1 was proportion of inorganic - organic N fertilizer (138 kg N ha-1): 100% Urea, 75% Urea + 25% goat manure, 50% Urea + 50% goat manure, and 25% Urea + 75% goat manure. Factor 2 was number of main branches: 1, 2 and 3 main branches.Results showed that there was no interaction effect between treatment combinations of organic-inorganic sources of N and the number of main branches to all observed variables. Treatment using the combination of 75% Urea + 25% goat manure increased the plant growth and gave the highest fruit yield (49.20 t ha-1) in comparison with combination using other fertilizers and 100% Urea. The lowest was derived from the application of 100% Urea, 35.61 t ha-1. Cultivation of eggplant with 3 main branches has resulted better growth and fruit yield than 1 and 2 main branches, 50.85, 47.91 and 30.79 t ha-1, respectively. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Local Rote is a well-known local groundnut variety in ENT, which is a potential superior variety and parental source due its large seed size and high yielding ability. Information on its resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses is important for its future development. Five groundnut genotypes, Local Rote and check varieties were elucidated to identify drought resistant genotypes. The study was carried out in a split-plot design with three replicates in two locations during dry season 2013. Two irrigation regimes (optimum and stress conditions) were assigned as main plot and 5 groundnut geno-types as sub-plot. Research results revealed significant effect of irrigation by genotype interaction on observed yield and yield compo-nent characters in both locations. Seed yields of most tested genotypes were below their yield potential. Local Rote yielded best over two locations (1.26 t.ha-1 seed yield). Yields of check varieties were below 1.0 t.ha-1. Local Rote was considered tolerant to drought based on STI, GMP, SSI and YL selection indices. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The aim of this study was to assess which environmental factors are positively or negatively correlated with productivity in particular yield of two local varieties of black pepper plant (Natar 1 and Natar 2) in Lampung province. Two observational studies were carried out i.e. phenological development and productivity of black pepper productivity in relation to various environmental factors. Our results showed that productivity of two varieties significantly affected rainfall, light intensity and micro humidity. Dry matter yield was positively correlated with rainfall, both in Natar 1 and Natar 2. It was concluded that among environmental factors affecting productivity of black pepper, rainfall intensity was the most influencing factor with a positive relationship with the productivity. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The study was conducted from January to April 2012 in Blora, Central Java, Indonesia. The experiment was arranged in Randomized Complete Block Design, consisting of four treatments and four replications. There were two types of control treatments i.e. organic fertilizer treatments (statistically analyzed) and conventional fertilizer (not statistically analyzed). The treatments were corn biomass, corn biomass+cow manure (7.5 tons ha-1), corn biomass+cow manure (10 tons ha-1) and cow manure (10 tons ha-1) with square spacing of 20 cm × 20 cm. The organic control treatments were corn biomass+sheep manure (7.5 tons ha- 1) with spacing of 20 cm × 20 cm and corn biomass+cow manure (7.5 tons ha-1) with double-row spacing of 40 cm × 25 cm × 15 cm. For every treatment, the rate of corn biomass was 3 tons ha-1. All organic treatments were also added with 3 tons rice hull ash ha-1. The application of cow manure (10 tons ha-1) with square spacing or corn biomass+cow manure (7.5 tons ha-1) with double-row spacing resulted in better performance than those of other treatments. © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The objectives of the study were to assess the variation in trophic level biomass and to analyze the dynamics of the energy channels on the increasing age of cocoa plantation. The characteristics of soil food web structure in smallholder cocoa plantation aged 4, 5, 7, 10, and 16 years were analyzed. The results showed that only biomass at the third trophic level increased with plantation age, but not for the biomass at the lower trophic levels. Biomass in all energy channels did not increased as well along with plantation age. We concluded that variation in the soil food web structure was more influenced by biotic factors of macro-arthropods group, such as facilitation, recolonization capabilities and accessibility in the soil habitat of smallholder cocoa plantation. © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Damping-off disease is the main problem in its nurseries. Fusarium subglutinans is one of the leading causes of damping-off disease. The knowledge of fungal infections process of tusam seedlings is essential to control damping- off disease effectively.The aim of this research is to understand (1) infection process of F. subglutinans in tusam seedlings and the defence response of seedlings against the infection of F. subglutinans. The methods used in this research were (1) identification of fungal pathogens that causing the disease, (2) pathogenicity test of F. subglutinans, (3) detection the accumulation of lignin, accumulation of callose and hypersensitive reactions by staining of seedling tissue using phloroglucinol, aniline blue and lactophenol trypan blue.The results of this study revealed that spores germination occurred in two days after inoculation. Direct penetration through cell wall and stomata was observed on the third day after inoculation. There was hypersensitive reaction in stomata. Accumulation of callose and lignin appeared on the third day after inoculation. However, defence response of seedlings was not effective, as F. subglutinans is a necrotroph fungus. © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Salinity tolerance of tomato germplasms was evaluated with respect to severity of leaf symptoms, shoot and root dry matter production, shoot Na+, K+, Ca2+ accumulation and their respective ratio. The salinity tolerance scale ranges from 1.00 (most tolerant) to 3.50 (most sensitive). Based on the severity of leaf symptoms caused by the NaCl treatment “BT14 (BARI Tomato 14)” and “BHT5 (BARI Hybrid Tomato 5)” were found the most tolerant germplasms to salinity with score 1.0. Reduction of dry weight was found to be 19% (shoot) and 15% (root) in BT14 and BHT5, 30-76% (shoot) and 27-83% (root) in other germplasms when salinity was added. Higher correlation was found between salinity tolerance scale classes and the reduction of shoot/root dry weight, Na+ concentration, K+/Na+, and Ca2+/Na+ ratios. Thus, “BT14” and “BHT5” can be regarded as a breeding material for development of new tomato varieties for tolerance to salinity. © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The research previously identified two quantitative trait locus (QTL) qIDC3.1 and qIDC2.1 controlling leaf chlorosis in mungbean grown in calcareous soil in 2010 and 2011 using visual score and SPAD measurement in a RIL population derived from KPS2 (susceptible) and NM10-12-1 (resistant). The two QTLs together accounted for 50% of the total leaf chlorosis variation and only qIDC3.1 was confirmed, although heritability estimated for the traits was 91.96%. It detected QTLs associated with days to flowering, plant height, number of pods, number of seeds per pods, and seed yield in the same population grown under the same environment with the aim to identify additional QTLs controlling resistance to calcareous soil in mungbean. Single marker analysis revealed 18 simple sequence repeat markers, while composite interval mapping identified 33 QTLs on six linkage groups (1A, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9) controlling the five agronomic traits. QTL cluster on LG 3 coincided with the position of qIDC3.1, while QTL cluster on LG 2 was not far from qIDC2.1. The results confirmed the importance of qIDC3.1 and qIDC2.1 and revealed four new QTLs for the resistance to calcareous soil. © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Humic acids could be used to improve the growth of rubber planting materials. Humic acid plays a role as a hormone-like substance. This research was aimed to determine the optimal concentration of foliar application of humic acid in order to enhance the growth of rubber tree planting materials. This research was arranged in a completely randomized block design with five treatments and four replicates. The treatments were the concentrations of humic acids, i. e. 0; 250; 500; 750; and 1,000 ppm. Observations were made on rubber tree diameter, plant height, shoot and root biomass, and nutrient content of leaves and the stem. The results showed that foliar application of 1,000 ppm of humic acids could enhance the growth of rubber tree planting materials. Foliar application of 500 – 1,000 ppm of humic acids could increase K content of the stem. The effects of foliar application of humic acids were more apparent in the root part than in the shoot part. © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

In every environment, a Randomized Complete Block Design was used with three replications. The method of Nassar and Huehn, Kang, Fox, and Thennarasu was used to analyze the stability and high yield. Spearman's correlation and Principal Component analysis distinguishes the methods based on two different concepts of stability: the static (biological) and dynamic (agronomic) concepts. The top method was found to be the dynamic stability. Meanwhile, the methods of Si1, Si2, Si3, Si6, Npi1, NPi2, NPi3 and NPi4 were found to be the static stability. Based on the ranking frequency stability of the nonparametric method, the genotypes with the highest frequency of static stability ranking were genotypes IPB002003, IPB002046, IPB009019 and Tit Super, whereas IPB009002 and Tombak were categorized as those of dynamic stability. Genotype IPB120005 and IPB019015 were less adaptable in the multiple environments tested. It shows that the genotypes were specific in certain environments. IPB120005 had high yield and specific location in Boyolali in dry season and IPB019015 genotype was specific in Bogor in wet season.","Chili pepper; Dynamic stablility; High yield; Nonparametric stability",,,,,,,,,,,"Akcura, M., Kaya, Y., Nonparametric stability methods for interpreting genotipe by environment interaction of bread wheat genotypes (Triticum aestivum L.)

The objective of this research was to study the effect of ""komba-komba"" compost and planting time of mungbean intercropped with maize on yield and soil fauna. The research was conducted in research station of Agricultural Faculty, Haluoleo University. The experiment was laid out using split plot design with two factors (""kombakomba"" compost and planting time of mungbean intercropped with maize). The result indicated that the highest net assimilation rate (NAR) of mungbean 5.78 g per cm2 per week was obtained in the komba-komba compost 10 ton per ha with planting time of mungbean at 14 days after planting (DAP) maize whereas NAR of maize 5.50 g per cm2 per week was obtained in the planting time of mungbean at 14 DAP maize. Coleoptera and Hymenoptera (Formicidae) were dominant and Shannon's diversity index ranged between 0.32 and 1.28. LER values tended to increase with the addition of ""kombakomba"" compost in soil and time variation of planting mungbean intercropped with maize. The relation between Shannon's diversity and LER values was variable.","Assimilation; Compost; Intercropping; LER; Planting time; Soil fauna","Coleoptera; Formicidae; Hymenoptera; Zea mays",,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, F., Haraguchi, T., Hirota, O., Rahman, M.A., Growth analysis, and canopy structure in mungbean intercropping (2000) Bult.

The soil erosion can be analyzed using USLE and MUSLE methods. Base on two critical land analyses methods with input soil erosion data analyzed using two methods will result in four combinations of critical land classification procedures. In this research, critical land classification and soil erosion classification were analyzed using GIS.The best method to classify critical land was investigated in this research, where the best classified critical land is the classified critical land result same with the field condition. Percentage of vegetation cover (PVC) is one of the most important input data in the critical land classification analysis using BRLKT method. This data has 50 of 100 total weights. To analyze this PVC classification, NDVI generated from satellite remote sensing data was employed in this research.

The objectives of this research are to create enriched granular-compost (EGC) and to test its effect on nutrient availability, plant growth, and grain yield in intensive farming systems. The research was conducted in two consecutive years (2011-2012), consisting of three steps: production of EGC, incubation and field experiment. Incubation experiment was designed by randomized complete design with 5 treatments (control, 4, 6, 8, and 12 Mg ha-1), andthe design of field experiment was randomized block design with 7 treatments (control, inorganic fertilizer (IF), 25% EGC + 75% IF, 50% EGC + 50% IF, 75% EGC + 25% IF, 100% EGC + 100% IF and 100% EGC). The results showed that application of EGC increased total-N and P-available 12.5% and 33% respectively on the 10th day after incubation. The highest grain yield (6.13 Mg ha-1) was gained from the application of 100% EGC + 100% IF. The productivity of rice is closely related to the number of productive panicles per plant (r = 0.507*) and percent of filled grain (r = 0.685*).","Enriched granular-compost; Grain yield; Nutrient availability",,,,,,,,,,,"Cho, J.Y., Seasonal run off estimation of N and P in a paddy field of Central Korea (2003) Nutrient Cycling in Agroeco-systems, 65, pp. 43-52; Cho, J.Y., Son, J.G., Song, C.H., Hwang, S.A., Lee, Y.M., Jeong, S.Y., Chung, B.Y., Integrated nutrient management for environmental-friendly rice product-ion in salt affected rice paddy fields of Saemngeum reclaimed land of South Korea (2008) Paddy Water Environment J., 6, pp. 263-273; Dobbelaere, S., Vanderleyden, J., Okon, Y., Plant growth promoting effects of diazotrophs in the rhizosphere (2003) Critical Rev.

There were three series experiments conducted in dry season, 2011 and 2012. The research was conducted using nested design and three replications. Nested design was applied in order to get information as careful as possible about the role of treatment, especially the main factor. The first experiment was carried out in the field while the second and third were in the green house.The experiments had two factors, pyraclostrobin application and nitrogen fertilizer. Vegetative growth, flowering and earing age, chlorophyll content, yield, amylose and protein content were evaluated. Application of pyraclostrobin, significantly increased nitrogen fertilizer efficiency. Amylose content and fresh yield were different on nitrogen and pyraclostrobin application. Application of pyraclostrobin 400 ml/ha significantly increased amylose 10.85-18.5%.Both amylose and protein content were increased by nitrogen fertilizer application.

Soil without any inoculation was provided as control. The treatments were arranged in a Completely Randomized Design with four replications. Soil fertility status was based on the concentrations of N, P, K, and organic-C as well as soil pH. Plant performance was determined based on its ability to uptake nutrients (N, P, K, and Ca), its growth and yield. Then, the activity of mycorrhiza was measured based on total population and percentage of root infection. Overall, results of the present study showed that, compared with other treatments, inoculation of mycorrhiza into soil and amended with cattle manure significantly performed higher concentrations of N, P, K, and organic-C. This soil condition caused soybean to absorb significantly higher nutrients, grew well with higher yield compared with plant performance in other treatments. Therefore, results of this study implies that the application of mycorrhiza into soil amended with organic matter is promising to sustain soil productivity under soybean cropping system.","Arbuscular Mycorrhiza; Dryland; Soil fertility; Soybean yield",,,,,,,,,,,"Astiko, W., Wangiyana, P.W., Sastrahidayat, I.R., Tejowulan, R.S., The compatibility of some formulation of VAM fungus P uptake and crop yield grown in various marginal soil in the tropics (2005) ICOM.

The framework of REDD+ is illustrated using examples from scientific literature and the agreements adopted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The institutional challenges related to REDD+ are discussed in the context of how to promote and implement REDD+ activities. Key issues for advancing REDD+ in the future include the establishment of a financial framework, the transferability of results, the risk of double counting, the timing of payments, and the domestic distribution of funds. Because agreements related to REDD+ do not mention transfers or trade of results from REDD+ activities, the transfer of results might give disincentives to developing countries; thus, allowing transfers or trade may actually limit REDD+ activities. Therefore, it seems preferable that the results of reduced emissions and increased removals through REDD+ activities, through publicly financed programs under the UNFCCC and Green Climate Fund (GCF), should be non-transferable. The transferability of results through REDD+ activities is important to consider, especially for different schemes such as the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) and the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), because double counting can occur between countries and between schemes. Although I support advance performance-based payments for the planning and implementation of REDD+ activities, which is a similar concept to that discussed by the GCF, appropriate indicators and transparent methods for monitoring and evaluating performance will be required. © 2019 Universitas Brawijaya.","Deforestation; Developing country; Emission reduction; REDD+; UNFCCC",,,,,,"Kementerian Riset, Teknologi dan Pendidikan Tinggi: 30/E/KPT/2018","Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of The Republic of Indonesia, Decree No: 30/E/KPT/2018.

This was initiated by a study on the effect of temperature and duration of beetroot storage on betacyanin content after determination of a wavelength that giving the maximum absorbance of betacyanin extracts from beetroots. The second study was designed to examine the response of betacyanin and plant growth to nitrogen (N) fertilization. A randomized block design was used to impose the treatment of N fertilizer (Urea) consisting of 0, 0.15, 0.30, 0.45, and 0.60 g N/plant with five replicates. The maximum absorbance of betacyanin extracts from fresh beetroots was attained at the wavelength of 536 nm. Betacyanin content of beetroots increased from 229 ml/l to 639 ml/l during 7 days storage under room temperature (± 22 0 C), and was declined after slight increases when stored at lower temperatures. Nitrogen fertilization with the dosage of 0.6 g N/plant reduced betacyanin content up to 25 % from 351.5 to 257.6 ml/l, while root yield and total dry weight (TDW) increased with the supply of N fertilizer. © 2019, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The investigation of correlation between cocoa responses and VSD attack becomes important information to figure out the effect of decreased productivity as the consequences of the physiological damages. The objective of this research was to describe the pathogen infection and the symptom of VSD through fungal staining method and to asses the changes of some physiological aspects (chlorophyll and gass exchange character) under VSD pathogen infection. This study was conducted in Kaliwining experimental station, ICCRI, Jember, East Java, Indonesia. The result of the study indicated that late infection stage caused chlorophyll degradation, decreasing transpiration rate, and increasing temperature in both tolerant clone (Scavina 6) and susceptible clone (TSH 858). The rate of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and concentration of CO2 in susceptible clone (TSH 858) showed a drastic decrease when infected by VSD pathogen than that of in healthy plants. In resistant clone (Scavina 6), photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance, and concentration of CO2 showed no significant decrease when infected by VSD pathogen compared to that non-infected condition. © 2019, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The aim of this research was to determine the effect of pruning on vegetative and generative growth, and fruit quality of ‘Crystal’ guava. The experiment was conducted from September 2016 to April 2017 at Cikabayan Research Station of Bogor Agricultural University, Dramaga, Bogor, Indonesia (-6.550780, 106.714531). The experiment used completely randomized design with six replications. There were three treatments i.e. a) pruning by leaving 4 pairs of leaves, b) pruning by leaving 8 pairs of leaves, and c) control (without pruning). Pruning was applied after shoot leaves grew fully. The result showed that pruning significantly increased the total number of shoots and generative shoots. Pruned plants produced more flower and fruit than un-pruned ones.

The majority of farmers in this ecosystem are smallholders with limited adoption capacity on introduced technologies and modern agricultural practices. The objectives of this research were (1) to comprehensively capture multidimensional constrains that restrained local farmers in increasing their agricultural productivity; and (2) to identify, assess, and develop substantially-relevant, financially-affordable, and socially-acceptable agricultural technologies and practices for smallholder farmers to increase productivity. This research was organized in three main activities: qualitative research employing Grounded Theory procedure, quantitative questionnaire-guided survey, and a series of laboratory and field experiments. The research results indicated that the main constraints in increasing productivity and cropping intensity on the non-tidal wetland in South Sumatra include (1) unpredictable flooding occurrence and low soil nutrients content (agronomic constraint), (2) low financial and technology adoption capacity of local farmers (economic constraint), and (3) public policy has not significantly escalated farmer’s motivation to increase food production (social and institutional constraint). This research suggests that multidimensional (technical, financial, ecological, and socio-cultural) approaches should be integrated in collective efforts for sustainably intensifying food production on the non-tidal wetland. © 2019, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The sweet basil leaves were obtained from a commercial market in Los Banos, Philippines. The leaves were rinsed by water and then air dried. The dried leaves were ground using a domestic blender and 10 grams of this material was extracted using 100 ml of sterile distilled water (1:10 w/v) and 0.01 ml absolute methanol. The mixture was kept for 48 hours at room temperature. The solution was strained by a Whatman filter paper No. 1, then the extract was stored at 4°C. The effectiveness of sweet basil extract was determined in-vitro by measuring the mycelial growth inhibition of S.rolfsii and in-vivo by the percentage of disease incidence on tomato seedlings. The result showed that sweet basil extract was effective to inhibit the mycelial growth (33.35%). However, the effectiveness of water extract of sweet basil was considered ineffective for reducing disease incidence on the inoculated tomato seedlings, i.e. 46.67%-60%, similar to benomyl after the inoculation. Further investigation is needed to find out an effective formula of O. basilicum leaf extract which is stable and prolonged persistence for controlling S. rolfsii. © 2019, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The chemicals included fungicides for white rust control in chrysanthemum. The combined application of synthetic fungicide with biological agent and botanical fungicide were expected not only to reduce synthetic fungicide application, but also suppressed the white rust attacks. The research was conducted at the Indonesian Ornamental Crops Research Institute (IOCRI). A factorial randomized complete blocked experiment was designed to facilitate combined applications of hexaconazol-50 (SFH-50), antagonist microbe Corynebacterium sp. (Cor-5) and formulated botanical fungicide CEES 50EC (ES-50). The results showed that the combined SFH-50 with Cor-5 and ES-50 merely affected the disease intensity, yet less on white rust incidence, period of disease emergence, plant growth, flower production and quality. All combined applications of SFH-50 with Cor-5 and ES-50 showed lower disease intensity than single SFH-50. Higher suppressions were detected on 1 ml/l SFH-50 + 5 ml/l Cor-5-3 and 1 ml/l SFH-50 + 2 ml/l ES-50-3. The use of antagonist microbe and botanical fungicide singly or in combination with synthetic fungicide could reduce with the higher affectivity than single synthetic fungicide application. © 2019 Universitas Brawijaya.","Antagonist; Biological fungicide; Chrysanthemum; Synthetic fungicide; White rust",,,,,,,"The authors would like to give special gratitude to the Director of Indonesian Ornamental Crops Research Institute (IOCRI) that gave financial and facilities supports in conducting the research.

This research objective was to determine the effect of Trichoderma harzianum and T. virens suspensions to cacao pod rot disease on the field. This research was carried out in Pulo Hagu village, Pidie Regency, Aceh, Indonesia from March to July 2017. The single pattern randomized block design was adopted to evaluate three treatments, i.e. without suspension (control), suspensions of T. Harzianum, and T. virens for eight replications. Each replication consisted of three of experimental units. The result showed that both of Trichoderma species contained only Alkaloid metabolite based on Phytochemical test. On the field, the application of T. harzianum suspension reduced the percentage of fruit infection and disease intensity for 48.57 %, 46.04 % at 12 weeks after application (WAA) respectively. Based on the percentage reduction in the area of the spot between the metabolites T. harzianum suspension and control and T. virens and control are 47.24 % and 27.46 % at 87 WAA respectively. In addition, T. virens suppressed the percentage of infected fruit and the intensity of infected fruit for 40.61 % and 38.02 % at 12 WAA. © 2019, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

This study was aimed to analyze genetic profile of shallot adapted in peatland areas using SSR markers. Twenty-one shallot genotypes were tested in the field and eighteen primers dispersed throughout the genome was applied to analyze genetic diversity of the peatland-adapted shallots. Phenotypic evaluation revealed that shallot yield potential ranged from 6.66 to 14.21 t/ha. Of these, seven shallot clones (11 NA, 1111 TA, 12 NA, 12 NC, 20 NA and 22 N) had good yield potential and comparable with those of five released shallot varieties. Nine out of 12 shallot clones were moderately resistant to Alternaria porii. Clustering analysis showed that shallot genotypes were clustered into two main groups, Clustered I and II which consisted of 13 and 8 genotypes, respectively. The closest genetic relatedness was observed between 8NC and 8NA (0.85), while the farthest ones was between 11NA and Kramat2 (0.51). This result implies that cross combination between 11NA and Kramat2 is valuable and suitable for breeding programs aimed at improving shallot potential yield in the future. © 2019 Universitas Brawijaya.","Allium cepa group Aggregatum; Peatland; Shallot; Simple sequence repeat (SSR)",,,,,,,"The authors would like to thanks Indonesian Agency for Agriculture Research and Development (IAARD) for research grant through KKP3N program 2016.

To date, Indonesia can only provide 5 varieties i.e. Sidikalang, Tapak Tuan, Lhokseumawe, Patchoulina 1 and Patchoulina 2. In order to increase national patchouli production, several efforts needs to be done by providing new superior patchouli lines. This experiment was undertaken to reveal diversity of mutant progenies derived from gamma ray irradiation in patchouli. Six SSR primers were used to determine genetic diversity on MV3 generation of the mutants. Molecular analysis revealed a moderate to high polymorphism based on tested primers, which amplified 73 bands, and resulting of 0.705 PIC value. Dendrogram analysis based on Euclidean dissimilarity showed broad diversity that ranged from 0.23 to 0.82. Phenotypic tree gave clear separation that all mutant clones were clustered into three different group, with Eucledian dissimilarity coefficient ranging from 0.02 to 0.13. This report indicates that Patchouli vegetatively-propagated mutants were able to maintain their variability continuously from their parental lines (M0). Furthermore, our findings offer comprehensive information on breeding strategies of patchouli plants, giving an opportunity to assess important traits at early generation. © 2019 Universitas Brawijaya.","Diversity; Genotyping; Patchouli; Pogostemon",,,,,,"Kementerian Riset Teknologi Dan Pendidikan Tinggi Republik Indonesia: 06/INS 2//PPK/E/E4/ BAP/XI/2017","This study was financially support under INSINAS (IRPI) Scheme by Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia with grant number 06/INS 2//PPK/E/E4/ BAP/XI/2017 through the first author.",,,,"Bernardo, R., On the effectiveness of early generation selection in self-pollinated crops (2003) Crop Science, 43 (3), pp. 1558-1560. , https://doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2003.1558; de Figueiredo, I.C.R., Pinto, C.A.B.P., Ribeiro, G.H.M.R., de Oliveira Lino, L., Lyra, D.H., Moreira, C.M., Efficiency of selection in early generations of potato families with a view toward heat tolerance (2015) Crop Breeding and Applied Biotechnology, 15 (4), pp. 210-217. , http://doi.org/10.1590/1984-70332015v15n4a37; de Pasquale, F., Siragusa, M., Abbate, L., Tusa, N., de Pasquale, C., Alonzo, G., Characterization of five sour orange clones through molecular markers and leaf essential oils analysis (2006) Scientia Horticulturae, 109 (1), pp. 54-59. , https://doi.org/10.1016/J.SCIENTA.2006.03.002; de Vetten, N., Wolters, A.M., Raemakers, K., van der Meer, I., Ter Stege, R., Heeres, E., Visser, R., A transformation method for obtaining marker-free plants of a cross-pollinating and vegetatively propagated crop (2003) Nature Biotechnology, 21, pp. 439-442. , https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt801; Eduardo, I., Chietera, G., Pirona, R., Pacheco, I., Troggio, M., Banchi, E., Pozzi, C., Genetic dissection of aroma volatile compounds from the essential oil of peach fruit: QTL analysis and identification of candidate genes using dense SNP maps (2013) Tree Genetics & Genomes, 9 (1), pp. 189-204. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11295-012-0546-z; (2017) FAOSTAT: Crops and Livestock Products, , http://fao-stat3.fao.org/browse/T/TP/E, Retrieved September 7, 2017; Fu, H.-W., Li, Y.-F., Shu, Q.-Y., A revisit of mutation induction by gamma rays in rice (Oryza sativa L.): Implications of microsatellite markers for quality control (2008) Molecular Breeding, 22 (2), pp. 281-288. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11032-008-9173-7; He, Y., Xiao, H., Deng, C., Xiong, L., Yang, J., Peng, C., The complete chloroplast genome sequences of the medicinal plant Pogostemon cablin (2016) International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 17 (6), p. 820. , http://doi.org/10.3390/ijms17060820; Huang, H.R., Wu, W., Zhang, J.X., Wang, L.J., Yuan, Y.M., Ge, X.J., A genetic delineation of Patchouli (Pogostemon cablin) revealed by specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (2016) Journal of Systematics and Evolution, 54 (5), pp. 491-501. , http://doi.org/10.1111/jse.12195; (2015) Basis Data Statistik Pertanian, , https://aplika-si2.pertanian.go.id/bdsp/id/komoditas; (2017) Basis Data Statistik Pertanian, , https://aplika-si2.pertanian.go.id/bdsp/id/komoditas; Kusuma, H.S., Mahfud, M., The extraction of essential oils from patchouli leaves (Pogostemon cablin Benth) using a microwave air-hydrodistil-lation method as a new green technique (2017) RSC Advances, 7, pp. 1336-1347. , http://doi.org/10.1039/c6ra25894h; Kusuma, J., Ahsan, M.Z., Setiawan, W., Abdullah, K., Tahir, M., SSR-based diversity of domesticated and local cotton (Gossypium Spp.) populations collected in Indonesia (2018) International Journal of Agriculture and Biology, 20 (9), pp. 2019-2024. , https://doi.org/10.17957/IJAB/15.0725; Labra, M., Miele, M., Ledda, B., Grassi, F., Mazzei, M., Sala, F., Morphological characterization, essential oil composition and DNA genotyping of Ocimum basilicum L.

This research aimed to study the potential of S-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) as biological control agents to inhibit FOCe and provide available-S to shallot on Andisols. An experiment in laboratory was conducted to evaluate the capabilty of SOB in oxidizing S in liquid medium and a pot experiment was aimed to evaluate the capability of SOB in providing available-S and inhibiting infection of shallot by FOCe in Andisols. All treatments were arranged by a Completely Randomized Design with three replications. The data were analyzed by F test, followed by Duncan’s Test.The results showed that the capability of oxidizing S in a liquid medium increased after the incubation for six days, with the highest concentration of soluble-S was taken from SOB2 isolate. The isolate provided the highest available-S, while the highest capability of decreasing the disease incidence was taken by SOB3 and SOB1+2+3. SOB3 isolates promoted the highest growth of shallot. So it has a tremendous potential if they are used as an inoculum of bio-fertilizer and biological control agent of BPR of shallot. © 2019, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

İt can grow in an area with altitudinal range from 0 to 1,000 m asl. This study aimed to analyse physiological response and photosynthate distribution which is related to growth performance and tuber yield of West Indian arrowroot at two different altitudes. Four accessions of West Indian arrowroot i.e. Bantul, Krajan, Kemalang, and Begawat were planted at 250 and 1,100 m asl. This study was conducted using split plot design with altitude as the main plot and the accession of West Indian arrowroot as a subplot. The results showed that altitudes significantly affected physiological response, plant height, leaf area per plant, and tuber yield of West Indian arrowroot. The rate of photosynthesis in the highland tended to be higher than that in the lowland, but plant height and tuber yield were lower in highland. These results suggested that the West Indian arrowroot had different pattern on photosynthate distribution between shoot and tuber at different altitudes because of environmental factors. Bantul accession had the lowest tuber yield compared to the others, and showed the low ability of accession Bantul in distributing photosynthate towards tuber. © 2019, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Therefore, the research objective was to determine the impact of concentrations of exogenous brassinolide application on Leaf Area Index (LAI), Leaf Mass Ratio (LMR), Net Assimilation Rate (NAR), Relative Growth Rate (RGR), and Specific Leaf Area (SLA) of fig. Fig resources were propagated using stem cuttings and were transferred into 3:2:1 mixed soil (topsoil:organic matters:sand) media. Two cultivars of fig treated with brassinolide (control, 50, 100 and 200 ml/L) were repeated four times and constructed by Split Plot Randomized Complete Block Design. Changes in the parameter of LAI, LMR, NAR, RGR, and SLA were investigated monthly. There was a significant effect of fig variety alone on LAI, SLA and LMR but it wasn’t affected on NAR and RGR. SLA and LMR were influenced by brassinolide but not on LAI, NAR and RGR. Cultivar IBT showed higher responses to these parameters than cultivar MD after receiving brassinolide treatment. The interaction between brassinolide and variety was significant on LAI, SLA and LMR of fig except in the parameters of NAR and RGR. © 2019 Universitas Brawijaya.","Brassinolide; Leaf area index; Leaf mass ratio;

The data for this study were collected in Paung Laung Reserve Forest, Myanmar. The research developed two different methods for determining required sampling numbers based on changes in the coefficient of variation (CV) with the sampling ratio and sampling size using 37 plots of bamboo. These sampling numbers were derived from the sampling ratio with a CV less than 10 % and the stability of the CV. The error ratios of the two results between measured and estimated bamboo biomass were 6.0 % and 6.9 %. It will be necessary to assess the balance between the estimation accuracy and survey time for carbon stock estimation of bamboo, which is indispensable for an accurate forest carbon accounting in Myanmar. © 2019, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Many cultivars of certain crops also produce pandan-like fragrance/2AP including rice (Oryza sativa L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), mungbean (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek), soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), coconut (Cocos nucifera L.), cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), wax gourd (Benincasa hispida), and taro (Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott). The fragrant crop varieties command higher price than non-fragrant cultivars. Breeding for fragrance is a main goal in breeding programs in these crops. Although genetics studies revealed that the presence of fragrance in crops is monogenic trait and that mutation(s) resulting in null or reduced function of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (BADH2)/ amino aldehyde dehydrogenase (AADH) causes production of 2AP, the level of the fragrance is quantitative in nature.

This study was conducted to identify anatomical changes in the roots of foxtail millet genotypes with different tolerance level to salt stress. Four foxtail millet genotypes, namely ICERI-5 and ICERI-6 (salt-tolerant) and ICERI-4 and ICERI-10 (salt-sensitive), were grown hydroponically for 1 week prior to 60 and 120 mM salt stress treatments. Root anatomical changes were observed on the fifth day after treatments. The results showed that salt stress significantly induced some anatomical changes in the roots of foxtail millet, i.e. increased epidermis and cortex thickness, increased root diameter, and increased number of root hairs. The increase in epidermis thickness, root diameter and number of root hairs due to the salt application were more pronounced in the sensitive genotypes. Number of protoxylem in the tolerant genotypes significantly increased due to salt stress, however salinity significantly decreased the number of protoxylem among the sensitive genotypes. The different anatomical changes under salt stress between the tolerant-and sensitive genotypes indicated that some anatomical attributes of the roots might determine the salt tolerance level of foxtail millet. © 2019, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Changes in market conditions pose a threat for monoculturalism on homegarden and dry field. On the basis of this consideration, it is necessary to do a research on trees health in homegarden and dry field. This study aimed to determine the constituent species in the agroforestry system of Kulon Progo, tree health typology in Kulon Progo, and the type of damages to homegarden and dry field tree species in agroforestry. This research method used inventory of species in the agroforestry system and identification of damage to trees using Forest Health Monitoring (FHM). The result showed that there were three typologies of trees’ health. Those were classified into typology 1, 2 and 3 in Kulon Progo. The types of damage that present at homegarden and dry field in Kulon Progo are the open wound, galls rust, broken branch, leaf spot, excessive branching, gummosis and termite attack. © 2019, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Soil incubation was conducted to evaluate the effect of different moisture condition (75 %, 100 % and 150 %) on water holding capacity and fluctuating conditions between (150 % and 100 % water holding capacity) after application of urea and without urea addition. Ammonium and nitrate released were measured periodically over 70 days of incubation. Net mineralization and nitrification were measured at the end of the incubation period. Potential nitrification rate (PNR) was measured at the start and the end of incubation period. The results showed that the dynamics of NO3-did not show significant change with increased soil moisture without addition of urea. This results indicated nitrification in peat soil needed reactive N supply (urea) regardless of soil moisture conditions. Addition of urea increased the PNR ranging from 27.91 to 55.10 % compared to without urea. Fluctuating moisture condition with urea addition increased PNR by 21.82 % compared with a waterlogged condition. However, increasing soil moisture condition resulted in lower nitrate and PNR which reflect that soil moisture controlled the magnitude of PNR when urea was added. © 2019, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The difference of nitrogen sources will influence the nutrient absorption by roots. This research was conducted in June to September 2018 at field experiment in Batu, East Java, Indonesia. The method used a Randomized Block Design with the first factor was nitrogen sources and the second factor was field capacity as drought levels. The result showed that the proline content was 0.67 µm/g in plant treated by Urea which is higher and following by N-encapsulation at 0.52 µm/g. The proline strongly maintained grain-filling phases until field capacity 25 % at the entire nitrogen source (N-encapsulation, ZA, Urea) are 72.73 g; 69.93 g; and 66.15 g respectively. At 25 % field capacity induced length of roots and had the lowest number of tillers at 30.55 by N-encapsulation and less number of panicles was 19.33 per clump. The N accumulations were maintenance in higher concentration of leaves at 100 % field capacity compared with the other treatments. © 2019, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The peat soil material that used in this study was sapric weathering level. The field research was designed by using a completely randomized design. The treatment in this study was the application of fly ash consisting of six levels (0, 25, 50, 75, 100 and 125 g fly ash per pot), each treatment repeated 4 times. The results showed that the best plant growth and yield of rice were gained from the application of fly ash at the lower dose (25 g pot-1 and 75 g pot-1, respectively). The increase in fly ash dose (100 g pot-1 and 125 g pot-1) did not gave the highest rice yield (9.67% and 0.2% lower than the dose of 75 g pot-1) due to the macronutrients N, P and K as a limiting factor (only as a basic fertilizer). © 2018, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

This study developed allometric equations for estimating Pinang biomass on the basis of stem diameter and height by destructive sampling inagroforestry systems. Aboveground biomass was measured and linked to plant stem diameter at various heights (0.13 and 130 cm above the ground) and plant height. The resultant equation was used for biomass estimates in various agroforestry systems with Pinang trees, with total of 18 plots differentiated in bottom, middle and upper slope positions. As expected for palm trees, plant height is a better predictor (Y = 0.816 H1.42; R2 = 0.89) of biomass than stem diameter, with equal results for diameter measurements at 13 or 130 cm height (Y = 0.0689 D2.59; R2 = 0.74). Best results were for an equation combining diameter and plant height: Y = 0.03883*H*D1.2; R2 = 0.96. Agroforestry systems on the upper slopes had the highest carbon stocks (38.8 Mg ha-1) than the middle and lower slopes (25.9 and 22.5 Mg ha-1, respectively).

The research aims to study the effects of cytokinins and auxins on organ development and plumbagin production from shoot tip cultures. In vitro generated shoot tips were cultured on the semi-solid 1/2 MS medium containing 3.0 % sucrose, 2.0 % gelrite, and 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg L–1 cytokinins (BA, Kn, TDZ) and auxins (IAA, IBA, NAA and 2,4-D) for 12 weeks. The highest number of shoots (12.0 ± 1.2) was formed on the medium containing 1.0 mg L–1 TDZ, which was four-fold higher than in the control. Meanwhile, the highest number of roots per explant (9.4 ± 1.3) and rhizomes per explant (8.1 ± 0.8) were formed on the medium containing 2.0 mg L–1 NAA. The best callus induction (100%) was found on the 0.5–2.0 mg L–1 2,4-D-containing medium. Moreover, the highest plumbagin content (12.04 mg g–1 DW) was detected from shoots regenerated on the 0.1 mg L–1 BA-containing medium, which was approximately two-fold higher than that in the control. The study is efficient for organs induction and enhances plumbagin content from shoot tip explants of D. peltata. © 2018, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The culture cells obtained from the callus, cultured on CS-1 medium containing 3 % sucrose and 2 mg L -1 2,4-D for 4 weeks. The results showed that proliferation cell was signifcantly increased 1-fold in 3 weeks of primary culture in CS-1 conditioned medium (fresh/spent medium ratio 1:1) containing 3 % sucrose, 0.5 % glucose, 0.05 % fructose and 2 mg L -1 2,4-D. This medium was used to screen the cell lines through applying culture filtrate of Xoo. The method was to find a novel cell line which could produce high amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Screening results showed 33 % cell lines were strong ROS-producing, two cell lines were selected and cultured for second round screening. The ratio of strong ROS-producing cell lines was increased up to 67 % in the third round screening. The strong ROS-producing cell lines in third round screening can be further cultured for plant regeneration. The rice cell lines with high ROS production may have potential of resistant cell lines against Xoo. © 2018, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

In Ecuador, fruit fly causes significant losses affecting more than 260 different fruit types. This study was aimed to estimate fruit fly capture effectiveness in orange tree regulated by volatile alimentary attractants to propose an alternative biological control. The experimental unit constituted by a Multilure trap (McPhail plastic wet version) for each vegetable attractant. Five volatile alimentary attractants more one control were compared. Thirty-five fruit fly individuals were captured, corresponding to the species Anastrepha obliqua, A. fraterculus, A. striata, and A. leptozona. The most abundant species was A. obliqua with 14 individuals. The most effective treatment was guava juice covering 40 % of the total captured flies. Maximum MTD rate (flies/trap/day) was not significant, considering it as a low catch rate plague. The results indicated the possibility of using this organic control method for fruit fly. It can become one of the technologies as an environmentally friendly method and in favour of farmers' health. © 2018, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

This study was conducted from July to October 2014 in a type-B overflow tidal swamp at 2°38'40.8""S 104°45'10.0""E, Indonesia. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with 3 replications. Diverse genetic backgrounds, countries and climatic regions of the 29 soybean genotypes were responsible for the difference responses among the genotypes to the environment. All temperate and sub-tropical genotypes were able to produce seeds in the tropical type-B overflow tidal swamp. Adaptability based on seed yield resulted in 2 highly adaptive, 16 adaptive, 5 moderately adaptive and 6 non-adaptive genotypes. Adaptive and highly adaptive genotypes produced 1.56-2.58 t ha-1 of seeds. Karasumame (Naihou), a subtropical genotype, produced the highest seed yield which was 65% higher than Indonesian average soybean productivity and 225% higher than soybean productivity with non-saturated soil culture technology on the tidal swamp. This study concluded that the temperate and subtropical genotypes can be used as germplasm sources for soybean development in the tropical type-B overflow tidal swamp in Indonesia. © 2018, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The World Food Studies (WOFOST) crop simulation model was studied in its application for soybean optimum harvest time and yield gap analysis in East Java, Indonesia. Data inputs were local weather of solar irradiance and daily temperature, with given soybean varieties provided in the WOFOST simulation. The simulation result was validated with the actual data using homogeneity test of regression coefficient. Result showed that differences between simulation and actual yield were insignificant (α=0.05), for each tested locations and soybean varieties. The average potential yield was 1,716 kg ha-1, where the highest was obtained from S-France 904 variety located in Malang Regency. The optimum root mean square error was 49.42 kg ha-1 with correlation coefficient of 0.918. Meanwhile, the optimum harvest time and yield gap have corresponded to the actual data where harvest time was at the shortest in Blitar Regency using N-France 901 and N Spain 903 varieties, while the average yield gap was 33%. In conclusion, WOFOST simulation model has a prospect to be applied further using local soybean varieties followed by validation in the whole East Java region. © 2018, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The study aimed to evaluate the effects of liquid smoke (LS) from coconut shell (CS-LS), pinecone (P-LS), and oil palm branch (OPB-LS) on the incidences of blood disease, induced resistance to Ralstonia syzygii subsp. celebesensis, and plant growth. Two days after banana seedlings were treated with LS, ethylene, auxin, lignin, activities of the enzymes of peroxidase (POD) and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) on the root of the banana seedlings were measured. Then, the seedlings were inoculated by R. syzygii subsp. celebesensis. The plant growth and incidence of blood diseases were observed daily and the 31st day after the application of LS and this bacteria inoculation. The results showed that the CS-LS, P-LS, and OPB-LS at all tested concentration could suppress the incidence of blood diseases up to 100 %, induce resistance of banana seedlings to the R. syzygii subsp. celebesensis with increased levels of ethylene, auxin, lignin, activities of POD and PAL, and plant growth, significantly. Based on the effectiveness of this bacterial control and the ability to promote the growth of banana seedlings test, it is recommended that the most effective treatment is P-LS 0.5 %. © 2018, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The information on the effect of ameliorants and bio-fertilizers on soil P fractions is limited. The study objective was to evaluate the transformation of accumulated P to available forms by adding humic substance (CHS), bio-fertilizers (CBF), phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB), or phosphate solubilizing fungi (PSF) on soil from Brebes. The experiment was conducted in rhizobox that has two compartments, namely inner compartment (rooting area) and outside compartment (non-rooting area). Shallots were planted for 26 days, observed for their growth, and analyzed for their P absorption. Soil samples in rooting and non-rooting area were analyzed for their P fractions after planting. The results indicated that the addition of CHS, CBF, PSB or PSF increased the harvesting of residual soil P through its transformation to a more labile P as high as 0.67% in rooting area. The dynamic of transformation in rooting area gave better information of harvesting P. The capability of harvesting accumulated P was in the order of CBF, CHS, PSF and PSB. For harvesting residual P, addition of humic substance or bio-fertilizers should be made in the rooting area. © 2018, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Alternative controls of this disease, particularly to limit the frequent use of synthetic fungicide, have been conducted. One of which is by applying botanical fungicides. Crude extracts of Ageratum conyzoides, Amaranthus spinosus, and Cyperus rotundus were used to suppress the rust disease intensity on Bima peanut cultivar. A. conyzoides extracts at 2.5% and 5.0% concentrations were the most effective biofungicide to reduce the disease. The disease intensity (29.8 % and 30.2 %) recorded at 10 weeks after planting (WAP) was significantly lower than the untreated crops (41.4 %). Both weed extract applications reduced about 50 % of pustule number compared to untreated crops at 10 WAP. Applications of 2.5 % and 5.0 % of ageratum extracts saved yield loss of 67.5 % and 63.5 %. Caryophyllene was observed in the roots, stems, leaves, and flowers of ageratum extracts in considerable amounts based on GC-MS analysis and may attribute to its significant antifungal activity. Higher total phenolic and flavonoid contents were observed in ageratum extracts than in amaranthus and cyperus extracts. Ageratum extracts at concentrations of 2.5 % to 5 % could be used to control peanut rust disease. © 2018, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

This research aimed to improve the Radiation Use Efficiency of rice by selecting plant canopies based on varieties and number of seeds per hole. Research was conducted from November 2015 to May 2016, in Landak Regency, West Kalimantan. A Split Plot Design with three replications was adopted to evaluate three varieties (Sembada-168, Inpari-30, and local varieties) as main plot, and the number of seedlings per planting hole (one, three, five, and seven seedlings per planting hole) as sub plot. Result showed that there was no interaction between varieties and the number of seedlings per hole to Radiation Use Efficiency (RUE) on rice. RUE on local variety was lower than Sembada-168 and Inpari-30. One seedling per hole had higher RUE than seven seeds with value of 3.36 and 2.17 % respectively. The number of seedlings showed that RUE of one and three seedlings per hole were higher than seven seedlings per hole. © 2018, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Rodent is one of important pests attacking rice both in vegetative and generative phases. The objectives of this research were to study the rat species and population, footprints, symptoms and level of rice damage and rice production by Trap Barrier System (TBS). The study was conducted in Jalur 6 of Muara Telang Banyuasin district, South Sumatera, 2016-2017. The research was carried out in two hectares of rice field with one hectare TBS and one-hectare non-TBS. Observation of rat population was done three times, during vegetative stage (30 days after planting/ dap), reproductive stage (65 daps) and ripening stage (100 daps). One species of rats had been found namely Rattus argentiventer. In non-TBS, rat population was lower. However, in the damage level, the rat population was higher than in TBS. The number of R. argentiventer male captured was more extensive than the female. The number of footprints did not represent the number of rodents caught. The existence of rat footprints was indicating the existence of rat effort to approach the rice plant. The yield of rice was higher in TBS area. © 2018, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

In the end, these potential microorganism should qualifiedly fulfill several requirements before they are formally stated for commercialization and wider implementation. Evaluations on their physico-chemical characteristics and viabililty after certain storage period were needed to ensure the effectiveness of the product during transportation and commercialization process. The research was aimed to evaluate B. subtilis strains B7 and B30 for their physio-chemical characteristic and viability after six months storage and investigate the efficacy of the strains against soft root disease of Phalaenopsis. The results showed that both antagonists had stable perfomances in physico-chemical, viability and efficacy evaluations after six months storage. The existence of active bacteria was demonstrated from the decrease in pH, murky suspensions and foul smelling as indications of fermentative reactions under optimal and minimal nutrients. Both antagonists showed stable viability after storage and effectively inhibited soft rot disease when applied on the infected plants with slightly lesser supression from streptomycin sulphate. © 2018, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Trichoderma isolates were derived from rhizosphere exploration on ginger, banana, pineapple and shallot. The synthetic pesticides used were mancozeb and propineb (fungicides), oxytetracycline and streptomycin sulfate (agrimycin, bactericides), carbofuran (nematicide), and deltamethrin and prefenophos (insecticides: synthetic pyrethroids and chiral organophosphates, respectively). The compatibility test used food poisoning method in a completely randomized design with three replicates. Variables observed were discolouration, sporulation, colony diameter, conidia density, and fungal growth at pesticides treatment. The data were analyzed by F test at 5 % significant level and continued by Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT) when there was a significant difference. The result of the research showed that the most significant decreasing of Trichoderma spp. was found on mancozeb for shallot, ginger, and banana isolates, and propineb for pineapple isolate, respectively, 89.4, 97.7, 93.3, and 95.2 %.

This studies aimed to develop Phal. amabilis micropropagation methods and evaluate the regenerated plantlet fidelity. Media supplemented with Thidiazuron (TDZ) and Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and medium pH adjustment effects to induce protocorm-like bodies (PLBs) from leaf explants and proliferate secondary PLBs were investigated. Clonal fidelity among regenerated plantlets was evaluated using eighteen SNAP marker loci. The results showed that the ½ MS medium supplemented with 3 mg L-1 TDZ and 0.5 g L-1 PVP was the best for PLB induction while the ½ MS medium supplemented with 0.5 mg L-1 TDZ was the best for PLB proliferation. For PLB induction, the media pH was adjusted into pH=7 for efficient PLB regeneration. Based on the assessment using 18 SNAP marker loci, four variant alleles in three loci (11.8%) out of a total 34 plantlets were detected. The mutation frequency at the evaluated SNAP marker loci was 2.5 x 103 (0.25%). Changes in SNP alleles may not always result in phenotype changes and allele variant occurrences may not affect phenotype fidelity of micro-propagated Phal. amabilis plantlets. Therefore, further studies about the phenotype fidelity among plantlets are necessary. © 2018, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Formulations were made from T. vogelii and P. aduncum (1:5) in emulsifiable concentrate (EC) and wettable powder (WP) form. Both formulations have strong insecticidal activity against C. pavonana. This research used a randomized completed design in different temperature treatments. Insecticidal activity of formulations after storage was tested against C. pavonana. The treatments were done using deep leaf method in 5 concentrations and 5 replications. The results showed that LC95 value of EC formulation after storage at condition: below 4°C, room temperature, and 40°C were 0.19%, 0.34% and 0.21% respectively. Based on LC95 value of EC formulation from each treatment, indicated that EC formulation after storage could hold insecticidal activity as good as insecticidal activity before storage due to LC95 value after storage relatively lower than LC95 value before storage (0.35%). In the contrary, WP formulation activity was significantly decreased in all treatments compared to WP formulation activity before storage based on LC95 value. © 2018, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Lombok Island is suggested to be a potential wheat growing area. To investigate the feasibility of wheat production on Lombok and the adaptation of wheat to the current cropping systems, field experiments were carried out at six sowing times in 2010 and three sowing times in 2011 at three different sites up to 1000 meters above sea level (m asl) to represent low, medium and high elevation areas. Eight Australian and two Indonesian wheat varieties were selected to represent a range in maturity types. Six sowing dates in 2010 were arranged two weeks apart, from 19 April to 27 June, and three sowing time in 2011 were from 20 May to 19 June. Plant development was rapid at this continuously high temperature environment with flowering occurring 40-70 days after sowing (DAS). Wheat productivity was influenced by elevation and sowing date, at lowland, yields were about 1 t ha-1 or less, whereas at 500 m asl and above ranged from 2-3 t ha-1. Mid-season varieties were higher yielding than earlier or later flowering varieties. The optimum sowing time was from mid-May to early-June. © 2018, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Better assessment on the diversity of the collected accessions will come up with better result of the cultivar development. This study aimed at analyzing the genetic diversity of 27 tomato accessions by morphological and molecular markers. Twenty seven accessions collected from various regions of Indonesia were planted in the field and evaluated for their morphological traits, and RAPD analyzed for their molecular markers. The UPGMA clustering analyzes, elaborating the combination of morphological and molecular data, indicated that the tomato accessions could be grouped into 5 major groups with 70 % genetic similarity levels. Current study indicated that although many accessions came from different locations, they congregated into the same group. Cherry, Kudamati 1 and Lombok 3 were the farthest genetic distant accessions to the others. Those three genotypes will be the most valuable accessions, when they were crossed with other accessions, for designing a prospective breeding program in the future. © 2017 Universitas Brawijaya.","Genetic diversity; Morphology; RAPD marker; Tomato; UPGMA",,,,,,"Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China

Landscape structure is often formed as a consequence of the fragmentation of semi-natural habitat, which can negatively affect species richness and abundance of insects. This study was aimed to study the effect of complexity and structure of landscape on the diversity, abundance and traits of flower-visiting insects in cucumber fields. This study was conducted in cucumber fields surrounded by other agricultural crops, shrubs, semi-natural habitat and housing area, in Bogor, Cianjur and Sukabumi regencies, West Java, Indonesia. In a total of 16 agricultural areas, complexity and parameter of landscape especially class area (CA), number of patches (NumP), mean patch size (MPS), total edge (TE), and mean shape index (MSI) of seminatural habitats were measured. Sampling of flower-visiting insects was conducted using scan sampling methods. The result showed that landscape complexity affected species richness (but not abundance and trait) of flower-visiting insects both for mobile and less-mobile insects. Flower-visiting insects also responded differently to landscape structure. Species richness, abundance and variation of body size of mobile insects were affected by structure of semi-natural habitat. © 2017 Universitas Brawijaya.","Flower-visiting insects; Landscape; Morphological trait; Species richness",,,,,,,,,,,"Alba-Tercedor, J., El-Alami, M., Description of the nymphs and eggs of Acentrella almohades sp.

Based on consumption as Thai traditional dessert, fruit characters at ripening stage are very important to improve the muskmelon cultivar. Understanding the genetic control of fruit traits is the key to a successful for crop improvement. Research aimed to determine the genetic effects, number of genes and heritability of fruit characters in muskmelon. The results have shown that both additive and dominant effects governed for fruit weight, fruit length, fruit width and fruit thickness with the number of gene as 40.26, 1.55, 10.70 and 11.10 genes, respectively. Simple phenotypic correlation coefficients shown, had a significant positive correlation among the four fruit traits. Due to the quantitative inheritance of fruit characters, quantitative traits loci (QTL) mapping of those traits were necessary to identify all controlling genes of fruit traits in further muskmelon improvement. © 2017 Universitas Brawijaya.","Discriminating land characteristic; Land suitability criteria; Sugar content; Sweet potato; Yield",,,,,,"Khon Kaen University, KKU

Using two independent sets of measurements on the same trees, the errors in the measurement of diameter at breast height and tree height were quantified, and the uncertainty of individual tree biomass estimation caused by errors in measurement was calculated. For both allometric models, the uncertainties of the individual tree biomass estimation caused by the use of a specific allometric model were also calculated. Finally, the overall uncertainty of individual tree biomass by combining the two uncertainties was calculated. The allometric model including tree height was 6 % more accurate than that excluding tree height when the uncertainty caused by allometric models became the only consideration. However, in terms of the uncertainty caused by measurement, the allometric model excluding tree height was three times more accurate than allometric model including tree height. As a result, the allometric model excluding tree height was 5 % more accurate than the allometric model including tree height when both causes of uncertainty, the allometric model and measurement errors were considered. In conclusion, errors in tree height measurement have the potential to increase the error of aboveground biomass estimation. © 2017 Universitas Brawijaya.","Error propagation; Individual tree biomass; Measurement error; Tree height; Tropics",,,,,,,,,,,"Basuki, T.M., van Laake, P.E., Skidmore, A.K., Hussin, Y.A., Allometric equations for estimating the above-ground biomass in tropical lowland Dipterocarp forests (2009) Forest Ecology and Management, 257 (8), pp. 1684-1694. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.01.027; Berger, A., Gschwantner, T., McRoberts, R.E., Schadauer, K., Effects of measurement errors on individual tree stem volume estimates for the Austrian national forest inventory (2014) Forest Science, 60 (1), pp. 14-24. , http://doi.org/10.5849/forsci.12-164; Böttcher, H., Eisbrenner, K., Fritz, S., Kindermann, G., Kraxner, F., McCallum, I., Obersteiner, M., An assessment of monitoring requirements and costs of “Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (2009) Carbon Balance and Management, 4 (1), p. 7. , http://doi.org/10.1186/1750-0680-4-7; Canadell, J.G., Le Quere, C., Raupach, M.R., Field, C.B., Buitenhuis, E.T., Ciais, P., Marland, G., Contributions to accelerating atmospheric CO2 growth from economic activity, carbon intensity, and efficiency of natural sinks (2007) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104 (47), pp. 18866-18870. , http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0702737104; Chave, J., Alo, C., Brown, S., Cairns, M.A., Chambers, J.Q., Eamus, D., Yamakura, T., Tree allometry and improved estimation of carbon stocks and balance in tropical forests (2005) Oecologia, 145 (1), pp. 87-99. , http://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-005-0100-x; Chave, J., Condit, R., Aguilar, S., Hernandez, A., Lao, S., Perez, R., Error propagation and scaling for tropical forest biomass estimates (2004) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 359 (1443), pp. 409-420. , http://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2003.1425; Chave, J., Coomes, D., Jansen, S., Lewis, S.L., Swenson, N.G., Zanne, A.E., Towards a worldwide wood economics spectrum (2009) Ecology Letters, 12 (4), pp. 351-366. , http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01285.x; Corbera, E., Schroeder, H., Governing and implementing REDD+ (2011) Environmental Science and Policy, 14 (2), pp. 89-99. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2010.11.002; Elzinga, C., Shearer, R.C., Elzinga, G., Observer variation in tree diameter measurements (2005) Western Journal of Applied Forestry, 20 (2), pp. 134-137. , https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_exp_forests/coram/rmrs_2005_elzinga_c001.pdf; Englhart, S., Jubanski, J., Siegert, F., Quantifying dynamics in tropical peat swamp forest biomass with multi-temporal LiDAR datasets (2013) Remote Sensing, 5 (5), pp. 2368-2388. , http://doi.org/10.3390/rs5052368; Fayolle, A., Doucet, J.L., Gillet, J.F., Bourland, N., Lejeune, P., Tree allometry in Central Africa: Testing the validity of pantropical multispecies allometric equations for estimating biomass and carbon stocks (2013) Forest Ecology and Management, 305, pp. 29-37. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.05.036; Feldpausch, T.R., Lloyd, J., Lewis, S.L., Brienen, R.J.W., Gloor, M., Mendoza, A.M., Phillips, O.L., Tree height integrated into pantropical forest biomass estimates (2012) Biogeosciences, 9 (8), pp. 3381-3403. , http://doi.org/10.5194/bg-9-3381-2012; Gibbs, H.K., Brown, S., Niles, J.O., Foley, J.A., Monitoring and estimating tropical forest carbon stocks: Making REDD a reality (2007) Environmental Research Letters, 2 (4), p. 45023. , http://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/2/4/045023; Hozumi, K., Yoda, K., Kokawa, S., Kira, T., Production ecology of tropical rain forests in southwestern Cambodia: I.

It can substitute of chrysanthemum. The novelty of cultivar and superiority of characteristic of gerbera are necessary in the floriculture markets. New cultivars can be created through hybridization between cultivars. This study aimed to find out the phenotypic performances of gerbera hybrids of Local Bali x Rubby Red. The research was conducted in Indonesian Ornamental Crops Research Institute, West Java, Indonesia from January 2014 to September 2015. Eight progenies of F1 hybrids and their parents (Local Bali and Rubby Red) were used as materials. In the hybridization process Local Bali and Rubby Red were used as female and male parents respectively. Genetic variabilities of Gerbera were achieved through this hybridization. Gerbera progeny no. 20.009 had the longest inflorescence diameter, the biggest outer sepal and the highest number of sepals compared to the others. The flower vase life of this progeny was not significantly difference to the male parent.

The objectives of this research were to analyze of endophytic bacteria (Lysinibacillus sphaericus/L.sphaericus) and salicylic acid as the inducers of rice resistance against X. oryzae pv. oryzae. This study used three-factorial incompletely randomized designs to study the effect of endophytic bacteria and salicylic acid on three varieties of rice. The results of the study showed that endophytic bacteria and salicylic acid induced rice resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae. This endophytic bacterium was also able to increase the plant height (AUPHGC), the number of tillers (AUNTGC), and the number of productive tillers. The application of salicylic acid at the concentrations of 10 mM was able to suppress the BLB disease and increased the number of tillers and 1000-grain weight. The result of study showed that the endophytic bacteria and salicylic acid could induce resistance of rice varities against BLB disease and increased the number of productive tillers. © 2017 Universitas Brawijaya.","Induced resistance; Lysinibacillus sphaericus; Salicylic acid; X. oryzae pv.

The objective of this research was to determine genetic variability, heritability, and path analysis of M1V3 cassava mutants’ characters. This research was conducted at Bogor Agricultural University Experimental Field Research from May 2014 to May 2015. This research used 32 mutants from five cassava parent lines which were Malang-4 and Adira-4 (national varieties), UJ-5 (Introduction variety from Thailand), and two local genotypes from Halmahera which were Jame-jame and Ratim. The results showed that gamma ray irradiation increased variability from five cassava genotypes. Characters that had high heritability were length of leaf lobe, lengthof petiole, stem diameter, and the height of plant. The path correlation analysis showed that number of tubers, number of economic tuber (&gt; 20 cm), height to first branchingand stem diameter had direct correlation with tuber mass per plant. The characters can be used for the selection of M1V4 generation. © 2017 Universitas Brawijaya.","Character; Heritability; Path analysis; Selection",,,,,,,"Thank you to The Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia, for the funding of this research though INSINAS (Insentif Riset Sistem Inovasi Nasional) scheme at 2015.

Cuttings from superior genotype were collected and treated with (in ppm w/w): 0, 2000 IBA, 4000 IBA, 2000 NAA, 4000 NAA, 1000 IBA+1000 NAA, 2000 IBA+2000 NAA. To record the timing and percentage of rooting, cuttings were treated with (in ppm w/w) 1000 IBA+1000 NAA or without auxin as control. The results revealed that application of auxin was significantly enhanced root formation as shown by the significant increases in rooting percentage and number of roots. NAA at 2000 or 4000 ppm was the most effective auxin to promote root formation (100 %, 17.8-25.5 roots per cuttings), followed by NAA+IBA (100 %, 16.8-9.8 roots per cuttings) and the least effective was IBA alone (79-100 %, 3.2-7.1 roots per cutting). The best treatment for rooting and shoot sprouting were (in ppm) 1000 IBA+1000 NAA, since it produced higher root length, better root morphology and higher shoot sprouting. It was also found that a combination of IBA+NAA each at 1000 ppm not only enhanced root percentage, but also shortened the time for root formation. © 2017 Universitas Brawijaya.","Auxin talcum powder; Concentration; Indole-butyric acid; Myrtaceae; Naphthaleneacetic acid",,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Egypt, MHE","The authors would like to thank Directorate General of Higher Education, Ministry of National Education for funding this research through the Graduate Study Grant (Hibah Pasca Sarjana) The University of Lampung 2016.",,,,"Abu-Zahra, T.R., Al-Shadaideh, A.N., Abubaker, S.M., Qrunfleh, I.M., Influence of auxin concentrations on different ornamental plants rooting (2013) International Journal of Botany, 9 (2), pp. 96-99. , http://doi.org/10.3923/ijb.2013.96.99; Benti, T., Effect of potted media mixtures on rooting ability of stem cuttings of F1 arabica coffee hybrid (2014) Greener Journal of Plant Breeding and Crop Science, 2 (3), pp. 062-066. , http://gjournals.org/GJPBCS/PDF/2014/May/040714178%20Benti.pdf; Costa, E.M., Loss, A., Pereira, H.P.N., Almeida, J.F., Rooting of Bougainvillea spectabilis Willd.

Verdcourt) genotype improving is the low of purity. The research on genetic purification of Bambara groundnut had finished in twice single seed descent. The objective of this research was to find out the uniformity gain level within lines each other after single seed descent applied twice. This research was conducted in Agriculture Research Station, Universitas Brawijaya, from 2014 to 2016. There were 20 selected local lines evaluated twice with single seed descent method. On the first and second evaluation, it was applied on previous 19 local lines and 1 check genotype. Similarity coefficient was analyzed with cluster analysis of qualitative characters within lines. Variability within line was described on quantitative characters. The local lines had different response on single seed descent selection. These differences depended on genetic of qualitative characters. On the first single seed descent, it got similarity coefficient of 0.704-0.832. On the second one, it got similarity coefficient of 0.804-1.00. Increasing of similarity coefficient from 0.10-0.168 will improve purification of local lines 15.76-20.19 %. Two circles of single seed descent selection were capable to purify local lines.

Although the pharmaceutical and/or toxic properties of C. militaris has attracted attention as a promising resource for finding bioactive compounds, only a few substances including cordycepin have been reported so far. In the previous report heterologous expression of LaeA, a global regulator for secondary metabolites production in fungi, has been succeeded in C. militaris. The LaeA-engineered transformants are proved to produce new and/or elevated production of secondary metabolites, as detected by HPLC analysis. In order to further characterize the secondary metabolites that were being significantly produced by LaeA transformant, HPLC profiling and structure elucidation by proton NMR were conducted in two target compounds, designated as compound 1 and compound 2. Compound 1 possessed the highly similar characters to insect toxin beauvericin in UV spectrum, molecular weight, and retention time in HPLC analysis. Proton NMR analysis revealed that compound 1 had the same proton signals as beauvericin. © 2017 Universitas Brawijaya.","Genetic engineering; LaeA; Transformation system",,,,,,,,,,,"Chiang, Y.-M., Lee, K.-H., Sanchez, J.F., Keller, N.P., Wang, C.C.C., Unlocking fungal cryptic natural products (2009) Natural Product Communications, 4 (11), pp. 1505-1510. , https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3101174/; Isaka, M., Kittakoop, P., Kirtikara, K., Hywel-Jones, N.L., Thebtaranonth, Y., Bioactive substances from insect pathogenic fungi (2005) Accounts of Chemical Research, 38 (10), pp. 813-823. , http://doi.org/10.1021/ar040247r; Isaka, M., Rugseree, N., Maithip, P., Kongsaeree, P., Prabpai, S., Thebtaranonth, Y., Hirsutellones A-E, antimycobacterial alkaloids from the insect pathogenic fungus Hirsutella nivea BCC 2594 (2005) Tetrahedron, 61, pp. 5583-5588. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2005.03.099; Isaka, M., Tanticharoen, M., Kongsaeree, P., Thebtaranonth, Y., Structures of cordypyridones A−D, antimalarial N -hydroxy- and N -methoxy-2-pyridones from the insect pathogenic fungus Cordyceps nipponica (2001) The Journal of Organic Chemistry, 66 (14), pp. 4803-4808. , http://doi.org/10.1021/jo0100906; Keller, N., Bok, J., Chung, D., Perrin, R.M., Shwab, E.K., LaeA, a global regulator of Aspergillus toxins (2006) Medical Mycology, 44, pp. 83-85. , http://doi.org/10.1080/13693780600835773; Lee, H., Kim, Y.J., Kim, H.W., Lee, D.H., Sung, M.-K., Park, T., Induction of apoptosis by Cordyceps militaris through activation of caspase-3 in leukemia HL-60 cells (2006) Biological & Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 29 (4), pp. 670-674. , http://doi.org/10.1248/bpb.29.670; Lee, S.-Y., Kinoshita, H., Ihara, F., Igarashi, Y., Nihira, T., Identification of novel derivative of helvolic acid from Metarhizium anisopliae grown in medium with insect component (2008) Journal of Bioscience and Bioengineering, 105 (5), pp. 476-480. , http://doi.org/10.1263/jbb.105.476; López-Berges, M.S., Hera, C., Sulyok, M., Schäfer, K., Capilla, J., Guarro, J., Di Pietro, A., The velvet complex governs mycotoxin production and virulence of Fusarium oxysporum on plant and mammalian hosts (2013) Molecular Microbiology, 87 (1), pp. 49-65. , http://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.12082; Luangsa-Ard, J.J., Berkaew, P., Ridkaew, R., Hywel-Jones, N.L., Isaka, M., A beauvericin hot spot in the genus Isaria (2009) Mycological Research, 113, pp. 1389-1395. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.mycres.2009.08.017; Ng, T.B., Wang, H.X., Pharmacological actions of Cordyceps, a prized folk medicine (2005) Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, 57 (12), pp. 1509-1519. , http://doi.org/10.1211/jpp.57.12.0001; Ownley, B.H., Gwinn, K.D., Vega, F.E., Endophytic fungal entomopathogens with activity against plant pathogens: Ecology and evolution (2009) The Ecology of Fungal Entomopathogens, pp. 113-128. , http://doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-3966-8_9, H.

On coffee, bees act to support a pollination that is shown by the number of harvested berries. This research aimed to evaluate the use of pyraclostrobin on flowering stage and insect pollinators on Arabica Coffee. Experiment was conducted in Kalisat Coffee Farm, Jampit, Bondowoso, ca. 1600 meters after sea level from October 2013 to April 2014. Randomized Block Design was adopted in this experiment. Three doses of pyraclostrobin and control were used as treatments such as 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 cc L-1 of pyraclostrobin, and repeated three times. Percentage of fallen flower, fruiting stage, fruit production, frequency of bee`s visitation, and bee`s behavior was observed as variables in this experiment. Results showed that 1) percentage of fallen flowers was reduced by applying pyraclostrobin at 1.5 and 2.0 cc L-1 up to 50 % compared to control, 2) flowering rate was faster than control at 1.5 and 2.0 cc L-1 of pyraclostrobin, 3) application of 1.5 – 2.0 cc L-1 of pyraclostrobin increased the number of young fruits and pinheads, and 4) pollinators preferred to visit flowers of coffee trees which sprayed by pyraclostrobin than control treatment especially Apis mellifera. © 2017 Universitas Brawijaya.","Apis indica; Apis mellifera; Arabica coffee; Fallen flower; Pollinator",,,,,,,,,,,"Barrios, B., Pena, S.R., Salas, A., Koptur, S., Butterflies visit more frequently, but bees are better pollinators: The importance of mouthpart dimensions in effective pollen removal and deposition (2016) Aob PLANTS, 8, pp. 1-10. , https://doi.org/10.1093/aobpla/plw001; Boreux, V., Kushalappa, C.G., Vaast, P., Ghazoul, J., Interactive effects among ecosystem services and management practices on crop production: Pollination in coffee agroforestry systems (2013) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 110 (21), pp. 8387-8392. , http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1210590110; Camargo, R.B., Weber, R., Júnior, W.J., Ono, E.O., Rodrigues, J.D., Cytokinin, pyraclostrobin and putrescine: Influence in the development of grape vitis labrusca cultivar Niagara Rosada (2015) American International Journal of Biology, 3 (31), pp. 19-31. , http://doi.org/10.15640/aijb.v3n1a2; Crespi, B.J., Yanega, D., The definition of eusociality (1995) Behavioral Ecology, 6 (1), pp. 109-115. , https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/6.1.109; Damatta, F.M., Ramalho, J.D.C., Impacts of drought and temperature stress on coffee physiology and production: A review (2006) Brazilian Journal of Plant Physiology, 18 (1), pp. 55-81. , http://doi.org/10.1590/S1677-04202006000100006; Damatta, F.M., Ronchi, C.P., Maestri, M., Barros, R.S., Ecophysiology of coffee growth and production (2007) Brazilian Journal of Plant Physiology, 19 (4), pp. 485-510. , http://doi.org/10.1590/S1677-04202007000400014; De Stefano, L.A., Stepanov, I.I., Abramson, C.I., The first order transfer function in the analysis of agrochemical data in honey bees (Apis mellifera L.): Proboscis extension reflex (PER) studies (2014) Insects, 5 (1), pp. 167-198. , https://doi.org/10.3390/insects5010167; (2015) FAO Statictical Pocketbook Coffee 2015, , http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4985e.pdf, Rome, IT: FAO; Gemmill-Herren, B., Allara, M., Koomen, I., van der Valk, H., Roubik, D.W., Chapter 1: An agroecosystem approach to protecting pollinators from pesticides (2012) In Pollinator Safety in Agriculture, pp. 1-14. , http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3800e/i3800e01.pdf; Hardiansyah, A.N., Sulistyaningsih, E., Putra, E.T.S., Effects of Pyraclostrobin on Growth and Yield of Curly Red Chili (Capsicum Annum L.)

This study elucidated chemical compounds and antifungal activity of Eucalyptus urophylla leaves oil. Effectiveness of E. urophylla leaves oil were evaluated as antifungal against pathogenic fungi of A. niger and F. oxysporum. Eucalyptus urophylla oil was obtained by hydrodistillation method from fresh leaves of E. urophylla. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was used to analyze the chemical compounds of E. urophylla oil. Antifungal activity of E. urophylla oil was tested with in-vitro assay against A. niger and F. oxysporum strains with five levels of oil concentration (1 mg ml-1; 5 mg ml-1; 10 mg ml-1; 15 mg ml-1; 20 mg ml-1). GC-MS analysis showed the most abundant compounds of E. urophylla oil were 1,8-cineole (66.31 %), α-pinene (16.92 %), α-terpinyl acetate (6.00 %) and γ-terpinene (5.13 %). Antifungal assay showed inhibitory effects of E. urophylla against F. oxysporum with IC50 = 1.61 mg ml-1 and A. niger with IC50 = 13.56 mg ml-1. Antifungal activity of E. urophylla oil in this study was probably due to the presence of 1,8-cineole. Results indicated the possibility of E. urophylla as antifungal against F. oxysporum and A. niger. © 2017 Universitas Brawijaya.","Antifungal activity; Aspergillus Niger; Eucalyptus urophylla oil; Fusarium oxysporum",,,,,,,,,,,"Avasthi, S., Gautam, A.K., Bhadauria, R., Antifungal activity of plant products against Aspergillus niger: A potential application in the control of a spoilage fungus (2010) Biological Forum — an International Journal, 2 (1), pp. 53-55. , http://www.researchtrend.net/bfij/tas21/12%20SHUBHI.pdf; Baptista, E.B., Zimmermann-Franco, D.C., Lataliza, A.A.B., Raposo, N.R.B., Chemical composition and antifungal activity of essential oil from Eucalyptus smithii against dermatophytes (2015) Revista Da Sociedade Brasileira De Medicina Tropical, 48 (6), pp. 746-752. , http://doi.org/10.1590/0037-8682-0188-2015; Cheng, S.S., Huang, C.G., Chen, Y.J., Yu, J.J., Chen, W.J., Chang, S.T., Chemical compositions and larvicidal activities of leaf essential oils from two eucalyptus species (2009) Bioresource Technology, 100 (1), pp. 452-456. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.02.038; Cooksley, V.G., (1996) Aromatherapy: A Lifetime Guide to Healing with Essential Oils, , Upper Saddle River, NJ, USA: Prentice Hall Press; Cumagun, C.J.R., Aguirre, J.A., Relevante, C.A., Balatero, C.H., Pathogenicity and aggressiveness of Fusarium oxysporum Schl.

Three replicates of three hydro-priming times (0, 24 and 48 h) were used on three cultivars. Seeds were germinated in a growth chamber at 25 °C, 65 % RH, or sown in pots in a controlled temperature glasshouse for the emergence and aerenchyma studies. Aerenchyma formation in root cortical tissues was determined from microscopic images of hand-cut sections at 5 and 50 mm behind the tips of 60-70 mm long nodal roots. The results showed that hydro-priming for both 24 and 48 h significantly hastened germination and emergence. Water seed-priming increased plant height from 20 mm to 40 mm 4 days after sowing. Flooding for 7 days significantly enhanced aerenchyma formation at 50 mm behind the root tips. The results showed that hydropriming for 48 h was the best seed invigoration treatment for shortening the mean emergence time. It hopefully provides seeds an opportunity to escape from the negative effect of flooding on seedling establishment. © 2017 Universitas Brawijaya.","Emergence; Germination; Hydro-priming; Oryza sativa",,,,,,,,,,,"Abdallah, E.H., Musa, Y., Mustafa, M., Sjahril, R., Riadi, M., Comparison between hydroand osmo-priming to determine period needed for priming indicator and its effect on germination percentage of aerobic rice cultivars (Oryza sativa L.)

The research was conducted in the laboratory of PT. Trigatra Rajasa, Mango plantation in Ketowan, Arjasa, Situbondo, East Java, Indonesia from February to September 2015. The development and survivorship rate were done through observation of life span of S. dorsalis from egg to pupa. Analysis of Variance and Duncan Multiple Range Test (p = 0.05) with 5 replications were applied to ensure the significant differences among the treatments. The result showed that development and survivorship of Scirtothrips dorsalis were supported by mango flushes and flower as well as some weeds such as Leucania leucochepala, Ipomoea triloba, Achalypha indica, Desmanthus leptophyllus and Azadirachta indica as source of food. Achalypha indica was the most suitable host with development time (12.82 ± 0.21 days) and survivorship (33 %). Weed Tridax procumbent, Momordica charantia and Mimosa pudica were unable to provide the living requirement for immature developmental stage of S. dorsalis. © 2017 Universitas Brawijaya.","Development; Mango; Scirtothrips dorsalis; Survivorship; Weeds",,,,,,,,,,,"Affandidela Rosa Medina, C., Age structure and sex ratio of thrip Scirtothrips dorsalis hood (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) associating with mango agroecosystem in East Java, Indonesia (2013) AGRIVITA Journal of Agricultural Science, 35 (3), pp. 227-236. , http://doi.org/10.17503/Agrivita-2013-35-3-p227-236; Akköprü, E.P., Atlıhan, R., Okut, H., Chi, H., Demographic assessment of plant cultivar resistance to insect pests: A case study of the dusky-veined walnut aphid (Hemiptera: Callaphididae) on five walnut cultivars (2015) Journal of Economic Entomology, 108 (2), pp. 378-387. , http://doi.org/10.1093/jee/tov011; Arcioni, E., What’s in a name?

Under these circumstances, several environmental conditions might not be as conducive as in highland and deviate the plant from the original characters and potential yield. Fifteen promising variants derived from an unconventional breeding program were evaluated at two different elevations; 1100 and 250 m above sea level (asl) at Cianjur-West Java, Indonesia during hot season from April to September 2016. The experiment was designed as progenital selection to seek the adaptive genotypes on the targeted sites. The results showed that varietal differences existed among the tested clones when grown under highland and lowland. At lowland (250 m asl), all clones showed growth retardation expressed by the reduction of flower qualities with different degrees among genotypes. In standard group, only 2015-9 and 2015-15 that produced unchanged flower color, with acceptable plant height standard for cut flower. While in spray type, all tested clones produced flower with degraded floret color. © 2018 Universitas Brawijaya.","Characteristic; Chrysanthemum; Clone; Evaluation; Lowland",,,,,,"Agricultural Research Development Agency","The authors would like to express their thank and high appreciation to the Director of The Indonesian Agency for Agricultural Research and Development (IAARD), through Centre for Horticultural Research and Development (ICHORD), Indonesian Ornamental Crops Research Institute (IOCRI) that financed, gave suggestions, criticisms in the planning and implementation of research project.

The lowest fresh weight loss, fungal incidence and microbial activity were observed in whole plant treated tomatoes. In addition, the longest shelf life 24 days and the highest firmness were maintained by whole plant Si treated tomatoes. A higher vitamin C content was found in the whole Si treated tomato plants compared to Si leaf or no treated tomatoes.

The three-week-old protocorms of D. phalaenopsis were genetically transformed with T-DNA carrying 35S:: GAL4:: AtRKD4:: GR through A. tumefaciens strain EHA 105.The cultures were maintained in VW medium with 10 mg L-1 Hygromycin. Due to the existence of glucocorticoid response element (GR) in the T-DNA construct, the transformed protocorms were transferred into VW medium with the addition of 15 μM Dexamethasonein 6 weeks after transformation to activate the transgene. A total of 12% protocorms has been confirmed for Hyg+ by using PCR. The expression of embryo gene AtRKD4 was confirmed by cDNA analysis using AtRKD4 specific primers and Actin primers as a positive control experiment. The expression level of AtRKD4 in 2.5-month-old D. phalaenopsis transformant shoots was 7 times higher than non-transformant plants, and increased to 86 times higher in 8-months,that much higher than that of non-transformant. These results provide an improved method for genetic transformation of D. Phalaenopsis and will (eventually) increase production efficiency in the future. © 2018 Universitas Brawijaya.","AtRKD4; Dendrobium phalaenopsis; Embryo; Glucocorticoid; Micropropagation Somatic",,,,,,"007/SP2H/LT/DRPM/V/2017

Establishment of protoplast technology could produce triploid seedles citrus and new citrus genetic combination. The aim of this research was to establish protoplast isolation, protoplast fusion between pummelo ‘Nambangan’ (Citrus maxima) and keprok ‘Garut’ (C. reticulata), and its protoplast culture. Protoplasts were isolated from leaves of in vitro seedlings of pummelo ‘Nambangan’ and embryogenic callus of keprok ‘Garut’ with two different compositions of enzymes. The results showed that optimum enzymes compositions for cells mesophyl wall degradation were consisted of 0.5% Onozuka cellulase RS10, 0.5% Macerozyme R10 and 0.1% Pectolyase Y23. Optimum enzymes composition for callus embryogenic cells wall degradation were 0.5% Onozuka cellulase RS10 added with 0.5% Macerozyme R10. Protoplast fusion was conducted with PEG-mediated. Protoplast mixture were incubated in 40% PEG for 8-10 min and after that could be observed 40.6% of unfused protoplasts, 4.6% of homofused mesophyl protoplasts, 28.2% of homofused callus protoplasts, 7.8% of heterofused and 9.6% of multifused protoplasts from mesophyl and callus.

Identification and introduction of resistance genes into elite rice lines has become possible by the use of molecular markers. KD2-1 line is an isogenic line of KDML105 carrying four resistance genes on chromosome 2, 3, 8 and 12 from IR64 variety. The objective of this research was to transfer blast disease resistant genes from KD2-1 line into RD15 variety by using phenotypic and genotypic selections by the aid of markers. In this study, the four resistance genes were transferred from KD2-1 rice line into a blast susceptible rice variety, RD15. The study resulted in the breeding of four elite rice lines with four resistance genes by phenotypic and foreground selection. The genome-wide SSR marker analysis of the lines showed more than 86.5% background genome recovery of RD15. Pathogenicity assays of the four selected lines exhibited a resistant reaction to all 13 isolates, with agronomic and yield performance, and cooking and eating quality characteristics similar to that of RD15. The phenotypic-genotypic (foreground and background) simultaneous selection strategy is very useful to introduce multiple resistance genes in rice as it is a fast and economical way for identification of anticipated recombinant lines with desired genes. © 2018 Universitas Brawijaya.","Genome recovery; Jasmine rice; Marker-assisted selection; Pyricularia oryzae",,,,,,,,,,,"Abedi, F., Babaeiyan, N., Moumeni, A., Performance of different rice genotypes against blast pathogen through linked molecular markers (2012) Journal of Crop Science and Biotechnology, 15 (2), pp. 79-84. , http://doi.org/10.1007/s12892-011-0098-z; Hasan, M.M., Rafii, M.Y., Ismail, M.R., Mahmood, M., Rahim, H.A., Alam, M.A., Latif, M.A., Marker-assisted backcrossing: A useful method for rice improvement (2015) Biotechnology and Biotechnological Equipment, 29 (2), pp. 237-254. , http://doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2014.995920; Hayashi, K., Yoshida, H., Ashikawa, I., Development of PCR-based allele-specific and InDel marker sets for nine rice blast resistance genes (2006) Theoretical and Applied Genetics, 113 (2), pp. 251-260; Jayawardana, W.A.D., Jayasekera, G.A.U., Wijesundera, R.L.C., Dissanayake, D.M.N., Thephenotypic screening of rice varieties for blastresistance towards developing DNA markerslinked to resistance genes (2013) Paper Presentedat Proceedings of 69Th Annual Sessions of Srilanka Association for Advancement of Science, , Part1.

Related to H. antonii, this research aimed to identify the arthropods diversity, population and attack intensity of H. antonii in three different managements of cocoa plantations i.e. Kedaton, Banjarsari and Nogosari, Jember district, East Java, Indonesia from February 2014 to February 2015. The arthropod collection was done by visually, sweep net, yellow pan, malaise and pitfall traps. Arthropods diversity and similarity were analyzed by Margalef species richness index (R), Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H’), Evenness index (E), Simpson dominance index (C) and Sorensen Similarity index (SS). The different number of arthropod, population and attack intensity of H. antonii between plantations were examined by Wilcoxon test. The research showed that the highest species richness, diversity and evenness index values was in Nogosari and it was in a stable condition. About 10 orders, 35 families and 41 species of arthropods in Nogosari, it was higher than two other cocoa plantations. Nogosari was different from Kedaton and Banjarsari based on Sorensen Similarity Index with 78.26 and 77.78% respectively. In addition, population dynamic and attack intensity of H. antonii in the three cocoa plantations were different in a year. © 2018 Universitas Brawijaya.","Arthropod diversity; Cocoa agroecosystem; Helopeltis antonii; Population dynamic",,,,,,,"dissertation for doctoral program at Faculty of Agriculture of Universitas Brawijaya.

It is an alternative source of non-caloric sweetener due to the sweet steviol glycosides contained in the leaves. As an introduced species in Malaysia, it is important to elucidate the genetic variabilities and relatedness among stevia accessions in order to broaden the genetic basis for future stevia breeding. This study described morphological and chemical variations and investigates genetic relationships among stevia accessions derived from across Malaysia and Paraguay using inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers. HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) analysis also revealed high variability with stevioside content between 4.54% (Taman Pertanian) to 20.36% (Bangi) and rebaudioside A content varied between 0.3% (Nilai) to 2.04% (MNQ). From 32 ISSR markers, a total of 332 bands were scored, of which 264 (78%) were polymorphic. The dendrogram from UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) cluster analysis separated 17 stevia accessions into 3 main groups. Rawang and Nilai were found to be closely related. The wide genetic variabilities among stevia accessions are a promising indicator towards the development of new stevia varieties. This valuable information will be able to assist parental selection in future stevia breeding programmes. © 2018 Universitas Brawijaya.","Genetic variabilities; ISSR marker; Morphology; Stevia rebaudiana; Steviol glycosides",,,,,,,,,,,"Abdullateef, R.A., Osman, M., Influence of genetic variation on morphological diversity in accessions of Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni (2011) International Journal of Biology, 3 (3), pp. 66-72. , http://doi.org/10.5539/ijb.v3n3p66; Anami, E.T., Poletine, J.P., Gonçalves-Vidigal, M.C., Vidigal Filho, P.S., Lacanallo, G.F., Kvitschal, M.V., Gonela, A., Characterization and genetic divergence in Stevia rebaudiana (Bert.)

Batsch): ‘Ikeda’, ‘Akatsuki’ (white-fleshed) and ‘Tenshin Suimitsuto’ (red-fleshed) were used to study the effect of sucrose and auxin on the pigmentation of mesocarp. In the first experiment, mesocarp discs of ‘Ikeda’ and ‘Tenshin Suimitsuto’ were incubated on solidified MS medium containing sucrose, 1-naphtalene acetic acid (NAA), and their combination. A treatmentof 10μM NAA increased the total of anthocyanin content in ‘Ikeda’. In ‘Tenshin Suimitsuto’, a treatment of 100 mM sucrose increased the total of anthocyanin content. In the second experiment, mesocarpdiscs of ‘Akatsuki’ and ‘Tenshin Suimitsuto’ were employed to examine the effect of 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acetic acid (TIBA). The mesocarpdiscs were incubated on solidified MS medium containing NAA or combination of NAA and TIBA. A single TIBA treatment was applied in ‘Tenshin Suimitsuto’. TIBA treatment significantly (P<0.05) reduced the total anthocyanin content in both cultivars. The total phenolic content was decreased by TIBA treatment in both cultivars. A treatment of single TIBA (200 mM) significantly (P<0.05) inhibited anthocyanin, flavonoid and phenolic accumulation in ‘Tenshin Suimitsuto’. Present study shows that sucrose and auxin might regulate anthocyaninsynthesis, as well as phenolic compounds, in the flesh of peach fruit. © 2018 Universitas Brawijaya.","Anthocyanin; NAA; Peach; Pigmentation; TIBA",,,,,,,,,,,"Cantín, C.M., Moreno, M.A., Gogorcena, Y., Evaluation of the antioxidant capacity, phenolic compounds, and vitamin C content of different peach and nectarine [Prunus persica (L.) batsch] breeding progenies (2009) Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 57 (11), pp. 4586-4592. , http://doi.org/10.1021/jf900385a; Carvalho, R.F., Quecini, V., Peres, L.E.P., Hormonal modulation of photomorphogenesis-controlled anthocyanin accumulation in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.

Soils were sampled at 0-20 cm soil depth from 4 different slope positions (upper, middle, lower slope, and the bottom or flat area). The parameters analyzed were soil texture, SOM, bulk density, total pore, hydraulic conductivity, soil water potential (physical characteristics) as well as soil pH, CEC, Al-exchangeable, basic cations (Ca, Mg, K), N, and P (chemical characteristics). The results showed that the bottom area had better soil physicochemical properties than the others. SOM increased by 33%, total pore by 19%, void ratio by 47%, plant available water (PAW) by 28%, soil pH-H2O by 41%, CEC by 171%, total-N by 170%, and P-potential by 114%, in contrast, soil BD and exchangeable-Al were lower (20% and 96%, respectively) in the bottom than in the sloping land. The middle slope had the poorest soil physico-chemical properties after 26 years of forest conversion into oil palm plantation. All sites had clay texture, the clay content increased (R2=0.93) by lowering slope position, and so did SOM content (R2=0.86), soil CEC (R2=0.93), and soil total-N values (R2=0.76). © 2018 Universitas Brawijaya.","Oil palm plantation;

Profound study is needed to be able to find out the responses of Pegagan to various treatments in order to increase centelloside content. It was also previously reported that the highest asiaticoside content was found at the lowland pegagan, Pantai Labu. Current study on planted lowland pegagan of Deli Serdang with 2.38% of asiaticoside content was aimed to know the response of the plants to phosphorus fertilizing, elicitorand harvesting time related to biomass production from leaves, petioles, roots and tendrils. Phosphorus fertilizer was applied in four levels: 0, 18, 36 and 54 kg P2O5.ha-1, which affected centelloside synthesis, and elicitor of methyl jasmonate was given at three levels: 0, 100, 200 μM, while harvesting time was set up at 56, 70 and 84 days after planting (DAP). Data showed that the best combination for biomass production was obtained when there was no elicitor and harvesting was done at 84 DAP. The best combination between methyl jasmonate hormone and harvesting period in both fresh weight of leaves and petioles as well as roots was obtained when there was no hormone and harvesting time was 84 days old. © 2018 Universitas Brawijaya.","Centella asiatica; Harvesting; Methyl jasmonate; Phosphorous; Production",,,,,,,,,,,"Bermawie, N., Purwiyantimardiana, S., Variation in morphological characteristics, yield and quality of asiatic pennywort (Centella asiatica (L.)

In this study, different conditions have been set up to optimize transient GFP (Green Fluorescence Protein) expression in potato cv. Granola. Leaves of potato were infiltrated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 harboring pK7FWGF2 vector with a nuclear-targeted GFP by simple pressure. GFP signals allowed simple evaluation of transformation efficiency which were indicated by GFP expression in nucleus of leaf cells in infiltrated areas. The results showed that leaf position, co-cultivation time, optical density and the presence of acetosyringone significantly affected the transformation efficiency. The fourth terminal leaves from four-week old plants were the optimum age for transformation. Furthermore, the highest transient transformation efficiency was obtained upon 48 h post-infiltration at an OD600 = 0.8, and the presence of 200 μM acetosyringone. In conclusion, the developed protocol will be useful to study gene function as well as to generate stable transformation of this potato cultivar. © 2018 Universitas Brawijaya.","Agroinfiltration; Green fluorescence protein; Nuclear localization signal; Potato; Transient expression",,,,,,"Oktatási és Kulturális Minisztérium, OKM","Higher Education, Ministry of Education and Culture, Republic of Indonesia for providing financial support.",,,,"Abelenda, J.A., Navarro, C., Prat, S., From the model to the crop: Genes controlling tuber formation in potato (2011) Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 22 (2), pp. 287-292. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2010.11.013; Banerjee, A.K., Prat, S., Hannapel, D.J., Efficient production of transgenic potato (S. tuberosum L.

From the screening of 20 total primers, five primers (OPA 20, OPB 5, OPB 6, OPB 8, and OPC 19) producing polymorphic bands in RAPD analysis were selected. Different-shaped samples of sapodilla randomly collected from Bantul, Gunungkidul, Kulonprogo, Sleman and Yogyakarta city were used in this research. The analysis of molecular data was performed by using NTSys pc-2.02 and GenAlex 6.1 program. The clustering indicated that the accessions tend to group by their locations. However, there was no corelation between DNA marker and the fruit shape. The first group comprised samples from Yogyakarta city (Keraton Yogyakarta), Bantul and Kulonprogo while the second group consisted of samples from Sleman and Gunungkidul with genetic similarity of 53% and 37% respectively. The genetic diversity was high (PLP = 98.85% of 87 loci and H=0.280±0.14) comprising the genetic diversity within population (53%) which was greater than genetic diversity between populations (47%). Having the highest genetic diversity, Gunungkidul should be potential for conservation and selection of sapodilla in DIY. © 2018 Universitas Brawijaya.","Diversity; Fruit shape; Polymorphic; RAPD; Sapodilla",,,,,,,,,,,"De Aukar, A.P.A., De Lemos, E.G.M., Oliveira, J.C., Genetic variations among passion fruit species using rapd markers (2002) Revista Brasileira De Fruticultura, 24 (3), pp. 738-740. , http://doi.org/10.1590/S0100-29452002000300044; Bayazit, S., Imrak, B., Küden, A., Kemal Güngör, M., RAPD analysis of genetic relatedness among selected quince (Cydonia oblonga Miil.) accessions from different parts of Turkey (2011) Horticultural Science, 38 (4), pp. 134-141. , https://www.agriculturejournals.cz/publicFiles/50455.pdf; Chanda, S.V., Nagani, K.V., Antioxidant capacity of Manilkara zapota L.

The integrated application of organic and inorganic amendment on crops could effectively gain high yield of production. After application of treatments, variables such as pressure head, water content, hydraulic capacity, hydraulic conductivity, and diffusivity are important to determine and observe its effect on soil physical properties using RETC model. This study was conducted to investigate the influence of organic and inorganic amendments on Rasau soil series (Entisols). The comparison was made on the effect of organic amendments (Biogreen–BG and treated POME Sludge-TPS), and NPK fertilizer, and on maize yield which two of the treatments are the combination of organic and inorganic amendments (BG+NPK and TPS+NPK). The soil water holding capacity for NPK+TPS treatment was the highest compared to the control treatment. Hydraulic conductivity (Ks) was shown higher in NPK+BG treatment compared to the other treatments. In addition, the soil physical properties measurement in each treatment improved the soil hydraulic capacity uptake and moisture content. The combination of organic and inorganic fertilizer has shown a significant result in improving soil hydraulic properties compared to the NPK and control treatment. © 2018 Universitas Brawijaya.","Amendment; Hydraulic properties; Organic and Inorganic; Rasau soil series; RETC model",,,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, O.H., Sumalatha, G., Muhamad, A.M.N., Use of zeolite in maize (Zea mays) cultivation on nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus uptake and use efficiency (2010) International Journal of the Physical Sciences, 5 (15), pp. 2393-2401. , http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/IJPS/article-abstract/C82FCD134142; Ali, M.H., Talukder, M.S.U., Increasing water productivity in crop production-A synthesis (2008) Agricultural Water Management, 95 (11), pp. 1201-1213. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2008.06.008; Alvarez-Acosta, C., Lascano, R.J., Stroosnijder, L., Test of the rosetta pedotransfer function for saturated hydraulic conductivity (2012) Open Journal of Soil Science, 2 (3), pp. 203-212. , http://doi.org/10.4236/ojss.2012.23025; Anda, M., Kurnia, U., Restoring properties of artificially degraded ultisols and oxisols and the effect on crop yields under tropical conditions (2010) Communications in Soil Science and Plant Analysis, 41 (5), pp. 553-570. , http://doi.org/10.1080/00103620903531144; Anjanappa, M., Venkatesh, J., Kumara, B.S., Influence of organic, inorganic and bio fertilizers on flowering, yield and yield attributes of cucumber (Cv.

A study had been conducted to determine the phenolic, flavonoid, antioxidant activities and phytochemical compounds of C. nutans in different locations. C. nutans were harvested from eight locations and the leaves were extracted with 80 % methanol by maceration process. Then, the phytochemical screening using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), 2,2 diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) assay method, total phenolic content by Folin-Ciocalteu’s assay method and total flavonoid content by aluminium chloride (AlCl3) were carried out. The C. nutans extracts showed higher antioxidant activities than phenolic and flavonoid content. The neutral pH sandy clay soil from location KKK (Kuala Ketil, Kedah, Malaysia) had higher antioxidant activities (58.0 %), phenolic (44.1 mg GA.100 g-1) and flavonoid content (30.8 mg QE.100 g-1) compared to other locations. The GC-MS analysis showed the presence of phytochemicals constituents of 20 compounds. The results revealed that environmental factors (light intensity, temperature and soil characteristics) of eight locations were responsible for variations of phenolic, flavonoids, antioxidants and GC-MS analysis in C. nutans. The findings of this study will provide baseline data for future breeding programs for commercial cultivation. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The researches were divided into two stages. First stage was a calibration for model on field from June to September 2015. Second stage was the application of the model. The required data models included climatic, soil and crop’s genetic data. There were relationship between the obtained data in field and the simulation from CropSyst© model which was indicated by 0.679 of Efficiency Index (EF) value. This meant that the CropSyst© model was well used. In case of Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE), it was shown at 2.68 %. RRMSE value described that there was a 2.68% error prediction between simulation and actual production. In conclusion, CropSyst© can be used to predict the suitable planting time for soybean and as the result, the suitable planting time for soybean on the dry land is the end of rainy season (2nd June 2015). Tanggamus variety is the most resistant variety based on slow planting time, because the decreased percentage of production was lower (8.3%) than Wilis (26.3%) and Anjasmoro (43.0%). © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

It was a 2 × 6 factorial experiment comprising factors of mycorrhizal inoculation (M) with AM fungal inoculum (M1) and without AM fungal inoculum (M0), and of plant genotypes (G) with Gf (a cowpea inbred line), Gm (a mung bean inbred line), Gh1, Gh2, Gh3 and Gh4 (the 1st, 2sd, 3rd and 4th generation of cowpea hybrids, derived from cross-breeding Gf × Gm as female and male parents, respectively), and arranged in a completely randomized design with 9 replicated pots, where plants were grown up for 14, 28 and 42 days before harvested serially. Responses of cowpea genotypes to colonization and contribution of mycorrrhizal symbiosis varied greatly. The intensity of plant roots colonized by mycorrhizal fungi was highest on Gf, and it was descent on the cowpea hybrids following their generation order. On the other hand, the highest in plant growth response to mycorrhizal function was on G, followed by Gh1 and Gh2. These results indicatedm that the cross-breed of cowpea and mung bean lines has generated cowpea hybrids that tend to benefit less from mycorrhizal symbiosis for their growth. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The research was aimed to evaluate the susceptibility of several maize genotypes including local variety to the maize weevil. Six genotypes i.e. SJA, G10-12-20, G10-1-3, G10-1-7, G10-1-20 and G10-1-17 and Tosari as local variety were used. No-choice assay under laboratory condition with observed variables was laid an egg and F1 progeny number, the median time of development and weight loss of infested kernel. The susceptibility index was assessed using Dobie’s susceptibility index. Results showed that the number of eggs laid by five females and infested samples weight loss were not significantly different between six maize genotypes as well as local variety. In contrast, the number of F1 progeny emerged was significantly different. Based on the susceptibility index, the maize genotype of G10-1-3 and G10-1-17 were resistant to the weevil. While other maize genotypes and local variety were considered as moderate resistant. Based on analysis of chemical and physical characteristic revealed that maize genotypes with higher of the total phenolic compound and physical hardness tend to resist from weevil damaged. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The oviposition deterrent resulted from eggs deposition is valuable information that can be manipulated for managing its population. The objective of this research was to determine the presence of oviposition deterrent resulted by female Bactrocera carambolae on mango. Extraction of oviposition deterrent was conducted by maceration method. The preference test was performed using two arms olfactometer, meanwhile the oviposition deterrent test was conducted by exposed gravid females to fruit that already smeared with extracts. The result revealed that gravid females of B. carambolae were attracted to methanol extract of 1 day after egg deposition, whereas the methanol extract of 3 and 5 days after egg deposition repelled gravid females. Oviposition deterrent test indicated that methanol extract at category 3 and 5 acted as a deterrent. The preference of gravid females of B. carambolae to different category of infested fruit extracts was probably influenced by the chemicals modification on mango after oviposition. This result suggested that the female B. carambolae do not deposit oviposition deterrent. The phenomenon of deterrence was probably as a result of chemical changes in fruit as a consequence of eggs infestation. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Breeding varieties specifically for their resistance to BLB disease is therefore an efficient and cost-effective strategy. However, the resistance gene for BLB can be race and non-race specific, meaning it is often overcome by the pathogen. The identification of new sources of resistance genes for Xoo is crucial in rice breeding programmes. In this study, six rice varieties were assessed using six Xoo isolates in multiple screening conditions. The GGE biplot analysis considers both genotype (G) and genotype environment (GE) interaction effects and demonstrates GE interaction. The first two principal components (PCs) accounted for 95.46% of the total GE variation in the data. Based on lesion length and stability performance, Phaladum was the most ideal genotype against all Xoo isolates in the four screening conditions. The results relayed that Phaladum indigenous rice varieties could be considered as new sources of bacterial leaf blight resistance in Thailand. In the future, the BLB resistance gene in this variety will be identified in regard to mode of inheritance and used as parental line in rice breeding programmes for resistance to BLB. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

In vitro propagation enables a large scale production of high quality seedlings of A. adreanum quickly. The aim of this experiment was to overcome some problems in the in vitro propagation of A. adreanum, such as contamination, lack of plantlets vigor and low rate of survival in the acclimatization. In vitro propagation of A. adreanum was conducted via organogenesis from leaf explant. Explant sterilization using desogerm, antioxidant, alcohol, rifampicin, and NaOCl was the best because they reduced browning and contamination until 0 %. Organogenesis of A. adreanum was successfully initiated using MS medium added with 2,4-D and BAP at 1 mg L-1, which produced 74 shoots per explant. Shoots were best maturated in MS medium with a half strength of macro minerals added with 1 mg L-1 paclobutrazol. Survival rate increased by 7 and 14 days hardening treatment using double layer medium in the light culture room. Survival rate reached 89.3 % at 8 weeks after acclimatization. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Fresh MO leaves were kept frozen in ice gels pack until laboratory analysis. Four methods applied: RAPD marker for measuring DNA concentration and purification; Kjeldhal and HPLC for analysing proximate and amino acid (AA) composition; and IVGP. MO’s four distinct morphology found: green, red, reddish green and aromatic green. RAPD result analysis was 68.8-74.7 %, it means those MO had a close genetic similarity. The morphological differences are also related to leaves chemical composition variation. The highest protein and AAs content were found in aromatic green MO. Total IVGP at 96 hours reached 95.9, 99.3, 111, 115 mL per 500 mg DM in aromatic green, green, reddish green, red MO, respectively and statistically among those was highly significant difference (P<0.01). However, DM and OM digestibility did not differ significantly and estimated ME contents were similar suggesting MO leaves had sufficient fermentable nitrogen amount required to ensure rumen microbes normal activities. Conclusively, those MO has a close genetic relationship but the aromatic green MO more beneficial due its higher content of crude protein and AAs. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Part of the reasons were because of the used of unrealiable markers. This study was conducted to evaluate genetic diversity of Indonesian physic nut germplasm using four types of molecular markers (RAPD, ISSR, SSR and SCAR markers). Twenty four J. curcas accessions planted in Pakuwon, Sukabumi, with various phenotypes were evaluated. Twenty eight SSR marker loci yielded monomorphic allele pattern and indicated that the evaluated accessions probably were all genetically homogeneous for the respective loci. Eight RAPD and 4 ISSR primers out of the total 31 tested primers produced scoreable markers and some (i.e. UBC 873, OPG 17, OPP 03 and OPQ 11 primers) generated polymorphics markers. Genetic similarity coefficiens among evaluated accessions ranged from 0.6 to 1.0 with a population mean of 0.9 indicating low diversity and narrow genetic background among accessions in all populations. Therefore, breeding program utilizing such population would only result in low genetic gain. Based on the evaluated SCAR markers, all accessions belonged to the non-toxic Mexican type of physic nut. This information is important inputs for designing future physic nut breeding strategies in Indonesia. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The controlled cross-pollination in sweetpotato faces issues due to its cross-incompatibility and self-incompatibility characteristics. Currently, the in-compatibility level in sweetpotato is investigated based on the fruit set percentage. However, this criterion lacks the ability in accurately predicting the number of new clones. Therefore, it is essential to study new parameters to create a better inves-tigation of incompatibility in sweetpotato. The materials used in this research consisted of eight sweetpotato clones as female and four sweet-potato clones as male parents. Cross-pollinations were done reciprocally. The experiment was conducted at Indonesian Legume and Tuber Crops Research Institute from April to December 2014. The result showed that totally 5,188 times crossing produced about 25% fruit sets and 10% normal seedlings. The use of normal seedlings percentage as a new parameter in evaluating cross-pollination has apparently seemed to be more effective than the fruit sets percentage method because numbers of new clones could be known accurately. This research revealed that the normal seedling could be used as a new parameter in determining the incompatibility level in sweetpotato controlled cross-pollination. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The cultivars characterized in this study were Intapalum, Sritong, Prakaitong, Khantee and Srichompoo. The comparison of five sweet tamarind cultivars were carried out using ANOVA and DMRT with 0.05 of significant levels. The relationship between morphological characteristics was calculated by the Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Phylogenetic analysis used NTSYSpc ver. 2.1 to generate a dendro-gram of fruit characters. The quantitative characters (pod weight, pod diameter, and pod length) were significantly different. The biggest fruit was Sritong and the smallest was Khantee. Significant differences were shown on two qualitative characters such as pod shape and flesh color, while there were no significant difference on the seed shape, seed color and skin color. There were positive correlations among all quantitative pod characters of the samples. Pod weight was significantly correlated with pod diameter, however pod length and pod diameter were not significantly correlated.

The goals of this research were to determine the impact of four wild plants on three cash corps, focusing on the diversity and abundance of insect pollinators, and to test the efficacy of this scheme using farmland on the northern slope of Mount Slamet. This research was done using a split block design, with the three cash crops as blocks (strawberry [Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne], chili pepper [Capsicum spp.], and tomatoes [Solanum lycopersicum L.]) and four wild plant species as treatments (Cleome rutidosperma, Borreria laevicaulis, Euphorbia heterophylla, and Tridax procumbens) at different precentages (0, 5, 10, and 15 %) of cash crop plant density. The results show that growing wild plants with cash crops enhanced the abundance and diversity of insect pollinators. Moreover, the addition of wild plant species to the crops at four densities had significantly different effects on insect pollinators in terms of abundance and diversity. The com-bination of 15 % C. rutidospermae and tomatoes had the largest population of insect pollinators. From the experiments it concluded that an AES could be implemented in farmland on the northern slope of Mount Slamet. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Two Indo-nesian varieties (‘Argomulyo’ and ‘Burang-rang’) and three Madagascar varieties (‘FT10’, ‘OC11' and ‘Malady’) were grown under soil tillage and no soil tillage in Antananarivo Avarandrano, Madagascar. The planting date was from June to November 2014 in which the season was dry season with average temperature ranging 14-19 °C. Results showed that there was no variety × tillage interaction on the observed characters. Tillage system was significantly different on plant height, number of pods plant-1, grain size, and grain yield. The differences among varieties were found on vegetative and generative phases, plant height, number of branches and pods plant-1, grain size, and grain yield. Cold temperature suppressed growth and development of vegetative and generative phases causing agronomical characters decreased. However, soybean plants were still able to grow and develop indicating that soybean can be grown under no tillage system with cold temperature. Indonesian varieties (‘Argomulyo’ and ‘Burangrang’) showed equal grain yield to Madagascar Varieties (‘FT10’ and ‘OC11’), suggesting that ‘Argomulyo’ and ‘Burangrang’ were adaptable in Madagascar dry season with cold temperature. © 2017, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

This research discloses methodology for inhibiting rainfall, the evidence of coal combustion fly ash utilization, the adverse consequences on agriculture, and the adverse health implications on biota, including humans. The harm to agriculture comes primarily from aluminum addition to soil, changing soil pH and changing historic weather patterns. Aluminum in a chemically mobile form, not only harms plants, but is toxic to most biota, including humans. The micron and submicron particulates are used for weather modification contain heavy metals and radioactive elements which pose potentially grave human health threats including, but not limited to, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory diseases and reduced male fertility. Understanding that methodology and its adverse consequences by the agricultural community is crucial to identify and stop covert operations aimed at damaging the agricultural economy of a sovereign nation. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The research was conducted at Muneng Experiment Farm in Probolinggo from March to May 2013. Two factors consisted of five mungbean genotypes (MMC679-2C-GT-2, MMC647dGT-2, MMC554d-GT-2, MMC601f-GT-1 and Vima-1) and three levels of plant population (200,000, 333,333 and 500,000 plants ha -1 ) were evaluated at two soil fertility managements (with and without fertilization). The treatments were arranged in split plot design and replicated three times. All growth parameters observed were higher in more fertile soil. The increasing plant population triggered plants to grow taller, but reduced chlorophyll content index (CCI), number of trifoliate leaf per plant (LN), leaf area per plant (LA), total dry matter per plant (TDM), number of pods and seed weight, and nutrient uptake of individual plant. Grain yield production per unit area was not significantly different because of plant population compensation. All genotypes tested were suitable to be planted on population of 200,000 and 333,333 plants ha -1 . With proper fertilization and population management, the genetic potential can be expressed by 3.5 t ha -1 for MMC554d-GT-2, 2.4 t ha -1 for MMC601f-GT-1 and Vima-1, 2.2 t ha -1 for MMC679-2C-GT-2, and 2.3 t ha -1 MMC647d-GT-2. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

A two factors greenhouse experiment was designed according to Split Plot design with three replications. The first factor was soil types of specific and target location. The second factor was application of exogenous osmoprotectants, i.e. without osmoprotectant, 10 mM proline, 20 mM proline, 10 mM sorbitol, 20 mM sorbitol, 10 mM sucrose and 20 mM sucrose. Observed data included soil physical and chemical properties, rice vegetative and reproductive growth and physiological characters, and rice aroma quality. Collected data were subjected to analysis of variance, followed by an Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) post hoc and a simple correlation tests. Results indicated that grain yield per pot was higher on soil from target location than on soil from specific location, but concentration of proline and 2AP, and the aroma scores were in the opposite direction. Besides more effective in increasing grain yield, the osmoprotectants proline and sucrose, each at 10 mM, were also better in maintaining rice aroma quality compared tosorbitol osmoprotectants, and aroma score showed a significantly positive correlation with 2AP concentration. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

This research was carried out to find a variety that has active glyceryl trioleate with the highest content and to investigate the effect of nitrogen to the active ingredients of glyceryl trioleate in Coix lacryma-jobi L. and its effect in Coix lacryma-jobi L. treatment. The standard regressive curve equation of glyceryl trioleate obtained by using HPLC was: Y = (7.106) X- 495293, R² = 0.9997. The average reproducible experiment result of glyceryl trioleate is 0.097, RSD (relative standard deviation) is 1.95%; recovery rate is 97.69% and RSD is 0.89%. The experiment measured the glyceryl trioleate content of 14 varieties of Coix lacryma-jobi L using Qianyin #1 (C14). The result showed that fertilizer combination N10F2 (4:1:2:3) produced the highest glyceryl trioleate content in Coix lacryma-jobi L. Thus, nitrogen that applied in the fertilizer for 150kg ha-1 and the ratio of pre plant application including seedbed application, tillering application and earing application were optimized at 4:1:2:3 ratio. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The objective of this research was to identify the species of the most pathogenic fungi to Tetranychus kanzawai Kishida using RAPD-PCR. The internal transcribed spacer of 5.8s rDNA (ITS-5.8s rDNA) sequence of these fungal isolates were amplified using two sets of universal primers for ITS and then analyzed.

Marssonina leaf blotch has not been widely known and the problems are associated with the incidence of the epidemic so they need to be studied. Research aimed to investigate the biological aspect of Marssonina leaf blotch, the resistance of apple varieties and the alternative host of Marssonina coronaria, and the interactions between Marssonina leaf blotch and weather factors. The research was conducted in laboratory, greenhouse and on apple orchard respectively. There are three results in this research. First, fruit bodies (apothecia) are not produced by fungus, but only conidia (imperfect form) are. Second, based on bioassay, pathogen survives only on the apple. Finally, there are three formula can be used to predict the leaf blotch disease, such as:1) Y=-37.91+19.98X6 (population of spores in the air),2) Y = -438.13 + 25.71X1 (temperature) -3.05X2 (humidity) + 41.07X3 (wind speed) -2.07X4 (sunlight) + 19.25X5 (rainfall), and 3) Y = -43.86-1.61 22.60 X5 (rainfall) + X6 (population of spores). © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Soil amendment with Ca and Mg would improve growth and development of the sweet corn cultivars, as well as differentiating environments in selecting for adaptive cultivars. Aglime, dolomite, Portland cement, and a mixture of 3 aglime: 2 dolomite (w/w) were applied on LASS Yellow-Round (Y-R), LASS Yellow-wrinkle (Y-w), Bicolor and LAS Yellow-wrinkle (Y-w). The results indicated that the kinds of Ca and the doses apllication were capable to differentiate the sweet corn cultivars. Aglime 400 kg ha-1 was the best treatment to modify plant environment as selection factor followed by cement 400, dolomite 200 and aglime-dolomite mixture 400 kg ha-1. They improved the growth of the cultivars as well. The characters of interest of the cultivar had complied with those of commercial standard, except for plant height, ear diameter, and kernel-rows ear-1. However, since the genetic variation and broad- sense heritability values for those characters were essentially zero, the subsequent improvement would require genes from the outside populations. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Base substitution value, genetic distance and grouping of 15 mango accessions based on accessions in chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) among 15 mango accessions were assessed. The samples were originated from Mango Germplasm, Cukur Gondang Research Station of Indonesian Tropical Fruits Research Institute, Pasuruan, East Java. Sequencing of Chloroplast DNA was used to obtain nucleotide sequence data. Paired specific primer rpl20 F rps12 R and atp F rbcL R were used for amplification of non-coding area of mango DNA chloroplast and sequencing processes as well. All data were analyzed using Software MEGA 6. The result showed that total numbers and nucleotide base sequences varied among all accessions. All accessions were grouped in five different clusters that might be used as source of parental breeding. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Samples were collected to analyze the variation of soil nutrients in three cropping seasons: season-1 (March-April, 2013), season-2 (August-September, 2013) and season-3 (January-February, 2014). In each season 10 samples, 6 from conventionally cultivated soil (CCS) and 4 from organic fertilized soil (OFS), were collected from 10 randomly selected sampling points. The study observed acidic soil pH in all three cropping seasons, while soil pH was decreasing gradually with fertilizer application. The results of the study clearly depicted that all the soil nutrient contents and OM decreased with the application of fertilizers in different cropping seasons except Zn and Fe. The OFS contains relatively higher amount of OM and essential nutrients than CCS except Fe and Zn. The study shows that the continuous application of fertilizer in agricultural lands reduces soil fertility evolving nutrient deficiency in the soil; resulting in reduced crop productivity. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

This research was done using The WaNuLCAS (Water, Nutrient and Light Capture in Agroforestry System) model to determine the best land and water management under several scenario combinations of two factors. The first factor was rubber plant spacing arrangement system, which consisted of three levels, i.e. single row (3×7 m), single row (3×6 m) and double row (2×6×14 m). The second factor was water management treatment, which consisted of four levels, i.e. without irrigation and drainage, irrigation in dry season, drainage in wet season, and irrigation and drainage in dry and wet season respectively. The results showed that drainage treatment could enhance rubber plantation productivity. Moreover, rubber plantations which were using single row (3×7 m), single row (3×6 m) and double row (2×6×14 m) had no significant difference on latex production per hectare. © 2016, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Modification of growing environment and the use of tolerant variety are feasible alternatives. The experiment was conducted with several objectives (1) to identify growth and yield of black soybean at depths of water table, (2) to identify growth and yield of black soybean as effected by application of ameliorants, (3) to identify growth and yield of black soybean, (4) to identify interaction between depth of water table, type of ameliorant, and black soybean variety. It also used mineral soils with watershed B type of tidal land in South Sumatera on May to August 2014. Factors investigated were depth of water table (10 and 20 cm), (Tanggamus – as control, Cikuray, Ceneng) and ameliorant type (river water, peaty mineral soil water, and high-tide water). These factors were arranged in a Split-plot Design. The results demonstrated that, for growing black soybean, soils with water table depth of 20 cm was better than those of 10 cm, peaty mineral soil water ameliorant was better than river water or high-tide water ameliorant, Ceneng produced higher yield, but not to those of Cikuray. There was no interaction between surface water depth, ameliorant and variety. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The data analysis involved one way ANOVA followed by Duncan’s 5%. The results showed that the wood sawdust can be used as growing medium, and the addition of plantation wastes can increase the yields and the quality of white oyster mushroom. The addition of cocoa and coffee wastes with a ratio 25% was the optimum ratio treatment which increased the number of fruiting bodies, caps diameter, production weight, Biologycal Eficiency Ratio (BER) and protein, fats, carbohydrates and fiber content in white oyster mushrooms.

This field research objectives was to find out the corn crop cultivation in August 2014 which entered dry season. The iinstallation of subsurface drainage that previously had functioned as water discharge was converted into water retention. The research results showed that corn had grown well during peak dry season period (October) in which water table was at –50 cm below soil surface, whereas water table depth was dropped to –70 cm below soil surface in land without subsurface drainage. This condition implied that installation of subsurface drainage at dry season had function as water retention, not as water discharge. Therefore, network function was inverted from water discharge into water retention. It had impact on the development of optimum water surface that flow in capillary mode to fulfill the crop’s water requirement. Corn production obtained was 6.4 t ha-1. This condition was very promising though still below the maximum national production. The aapplications of subsurface drainage was still not optimumum due to the supply of water from the main system was not the same because of the soil physical properties diversity and topography differences. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Twenty-four experimental hybrid rice varieties which have been developed were tested in lowland rice fields in Sukamandi (West Java) and Batang (Central Java) during the dry season and the rainy season of 2012. Randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications was used in each location. The results showed that grains yields were affected by locations, seasons, and genotypes. The genotypes x locations x seasons interaction effect was significant; therefore, the best hybrid was different for each location and season. A7/PK36 hybrid has the best performance in Batang during the dry season, while A7/PK40 and A7/PK32 are the best hybrids in the rainy season. In Sukamandi, nine hybrids were identified as better yielder than that of the check cultivar in the dry season, but not so in the rainy season. Using the correlation and path analysis, we found that the number of panicles per hill and the number of filled grains per panicle could be used as selection criteria for yield in hybrid rice. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Field observations in West Java Indonesia was conducted in order to find the typical mottle symptoms that was a suspect caused by a virus disease. Identification of the virus was respectively conducted by performing ELISA test with four anti sera and characterizations held by bioassay, observing of virion particles, detecting of nucleic acid by RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing. Total of 403 samples were collected from plants with or no virus-like symptoms. Among those all tested, 83% were found to be infected by Carnation mottle virus (CarMV), but negatively against Carnation ringspot virus (CRSV), Carnation laten virus (CLV), and Carnation vein mottle virus (CVMV) antisera. By mechanical inoculation, the virus was able to infect systemically Cenopodium quinoa and locally infect on others. However on Phalaenopsis sp and Gomprena globosa, there was symptompless found.

Urea-humic acid applications at certain dosage are believed to increase rice growth and production. This study was aimed to examine the effect of urea and urea-humic acid to the amount and form of N-available, N uptake, plant growth, and the production of rice. Five dosage levels of urea-humic acid were applied for rice on Vertisols. Results of the research showed that the urea-humic acid fertilizer could increase the content of N-NH<inf>4</inf>+ soil at 28 days and N-NO<inf>3</inf>− soil at 42 days. The urea-humic acid could improve plant height, number of tillers, and total dry weight. The highest rice production is achieved by 100% humic acid-urea, especially on parameters of dry weight effectively harvested and effectively milled, with 5.56 tons and 4.61 tons per hectare respectively. Correlation between soil N-NO<inf>3</inf>− level with soil N-NH<inf>4</inf>+ level was significant at p = 0.05 (r = 0.871). Efficiency of urea-humic acid fertilizer at 100% recommended dosage (200 kg urea-humic acid) to the dry weight of effectively harvested crop with dry weight of effectively milled crop was 22% compared to the recommended urea fertilizer (200 kg ha−1). © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

One of the ways is through the process of adaptation and selection of wheat genotypes which planted in lowlands. This research was conducted in the district of Semarang and Demak in the period of 2011 until 2014. The purpose of this research was to investigate the performance of wheat genotypes grown in the tropical lowlands in searching the candidates for adaptive varieties of tropical lowland. Thirteen wheat genotypes that tested in the lowlands were ‘LAJ3302/2*M088’, ‘Altar’, ‘Selayar’, ‘Oasis’, ’HP1744’, ‘RABE’, ’H-21’, ‘G-21’, ‘G-18’, ‘Menemen’, ‘Barisbey’, ‘Alibey’, ‘Dewata’. The experimental design used was Randomised Block Design, treated separately with 13 genotypes, each genotype repeated 3 times. The data were analyzed using Analysis of variance, Correlation, HSD 5% level and Stress Susceptibility Index. The results of this research were the genotypes LAJ3302/2*M088, Oasis and Selayar has been considered as candidate of wheat varieties which adaptive in tropical lowland because this genotypes are more tolerant than the other genotypes in lowland environment. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Wilczek) is a socio-economically important legume crop of Asia. Varieties with large seed size and early maturity are preferred in commercial production. This study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling seed weight and days to flowering in mungbean. The mapping population comprises 155 F<inf>2</inf>-derived lines from a cross between Kamphaeng Saen 1 (large-seeded and early flowering) and V4718 (small-seeded and late flowering). The F<inf>2</inf> population was analyzed with 67 simple sequence repeat markers. The F2:3 families were evaluated for 100-seed weigh and days to flowering in two years, 2008 (one season) and 2011 (two seasons). Composite interval mapping identified six QTLs for 100-seed weight and 5 QTLs for days to flowering. Three genomic regions harbored QTLs for both seed weight and days to flowering, revealing association between the two traits. Comparison of QTLs for both traits found in this study with those reported in azuki bean [Vigna angularis (Willd.) Ohwi & Ohashi] and rice bean [Vigna umbellata (Thunb.)

Synthetic insecticide is not effective to control thrips and produce residual effect on crops. Insecticidal residue is dangerous for human, natural enemies and environment widely. Therefore, it is necessary to find an alternative thrips pest control on strawberries, through integrated pest manage-ment (IPM) implementation. Research was aimed to determine the effect of IPM technology for Thrips sp. on strawberry plantation. Research was conducted on strawberry plantation by comparing IPM and conventional plots, in Kusuma Agrowisata Batu from April to July 2009. Variables were used such as the number of larvae, adult population and damage intensity caused by Thrips sp., and fruit production. Data was analyzed by t-test on 5%. The results showed that the average larva and adult population of Thrips sp. on IPM plot were higher than conventional plot, 1.12 and 0.50 for larva and 0.87 and 0.27 for adults respectively. The damage intensity of strawberry crops on IPM plot was higher than conventional plot, 11.69 and 5.98% respectively. Based on average fruit production, IPM plot was higher than conventional plot, 48.32 g and 39.24 g respectively. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Seventeen sweet potato cultivars were planted in Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications applied at two locations, Malang and Blitar. Each cultivar planted in plot measures 2.5 m x 5 m in Malang and 3.0 m x 5 m in Blitar, and each consists of four rows with a spacing of 25 cm in rows. All cultivars gave a dose of 250 kg NPK fertilizer (15-15-15)/ha twice, one-third of dose given at planting and the remainder in a month after planting. Plants were harvested at four months after planting. Fresh weight and dry weight of storage root, fresh weight and dry weight of vines, harvest index, and the ratio R/V are determined. There was different performance of 17 cultivars planted at two locations. Cultivars planted in Malang were classified into four types, namely forage, which consists of three cultivars among 17 cultivars, low dual-purpose (3 cultivars), high dual-purpose (7 cultivars), and low root production (4 cultivars); while cultivars planted in Blitar turned into the forage type. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Sterilized explants were cultured on initiation medium (MS with 1mg L-1 BA) for 4 weeks, then subjected to media MS with 2.5, 5.0, or 7.5 mg L-1 BA. Numbers of shoot buds, shoots and propagules were recorded after 4 consecutive passages with 4 weeks intervals. Rooted plantlets were acclimatized in three different media, then treated with or without NPK (32:10:10) fertilizer solution once a week. After 2 months, the survival and growth of plantlets were recorded. Cultures of banana ‘Ambon Kuning’ showed higher regenerative capacity compared to ‘Raja Bulu’, producing higher numbers of shoot buds, shoots and propagules. The best medium for propagule proliferation of both banana cultivars was MS+5 mg L-1 BA, producing 40.7 propagules for ‘Ambon Kuning’, and 12.3 propagules for ‘Raja Bulu’ per explant. In all acclimatization media tested, 100% of plantlet survival was achieved. The best plantlet growth was found in sand: compost (1:1,v/v) with application of NPK solutions. The in vitro-derived plants were planted in the field and produced fruits of high quality. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Genetic parameters of a population, such as additive genetic variance and variance due to dominance which can be estimated using North Carolina Design I, were used to decide a breeding method to be applied. The objectives of this research were to estimate the genetic variance component of important quantitative traits in an equilibrium corn population and to decide the best method to develop the population. The research was conducted at Agricultural Station of Agriculture Faculty, Gadjah Mada University, in 2012 which was carried out in two steps: to develop half-sib and full-sib families and to evaluate both families in randomized complete block design with three replications. The data was subjected to analysis of variance, and was followed by estimation of genetic variances. The additive variance of ear length and ear diameter of the corn population was greater than dominance variance. In contrary to kernel weight/ear, the dominance variance was greater than additive variance. So based on kernel weight/ear, the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium corn population can be developed through inbreeding to form a hybrid variety. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

It was conducted in green house, from April to August 2013. The study involved two activities. The first activity for evaluating a salinity stress, consisted of four levels of soil salinity (EC): 0.9; 4; 7; 10 dS m-1 and eleven genotypes. The second one to obtain information about changes in physiological and morphological characteristics of soybean affected by salinity stress. The second activity consisted of two soil salinity levels (EC): 1.52 dS m-1 and 8.58 dS m-1. The results showed that at salinity 10 dS m-1, all varieties/genotypes were not able to survive until the age of 43 days after sowing (DAS). At salinity 4 dS m-1, total plant dry weight of most genotypes soybean decreased by 48.14%, while the salinity of 7 dS m-1 total plant dry weight of all soybean decreased by 64.89%. Concentration of K and Na in soybean leaves were higher than those in soybean root tissue. The content of K and Na in leaves and roots of most soybean genotypes increased as soil salinity increased from 1.52 to 8.58 dS m-1, except for genotype G11. © 2015, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Research was conducted from 2012 to 2013 in Tamanbogo Experimental Farm. Results showed that the total weight of feed consumed in the rainy and the dry season achieved the recommendation of 10% of the body weight of cattle. The average production of manure and urine was 11.25 kg head-1 day-1 with the biogas production of 3 m3 day-1 sufficient for cooking and lighting for 5 members of family daily. The by-product of biogas production was 8 kg day-1 of sludge and 127 L day-1 of slurry. The grain yield of P27 with application of dried sludge accompanied with 50% of NPK fertilizer recommendation dose gave the highest yield of P27 (4.45 t ha-1) with a profit Rp. 3,466,000 ha-1 and B/C of 1.5. © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The new promising clones have been bred through crossing among selected clones in Pagilaran tea plantation. The experiment aimed to select high yield and stable clone. Nine clones were grown in Kayulandak (1300 m asl) and Andongsili (1100 m asl) in Randomized Completely Block Design with three replications. The data of fresh weight per plot in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012 were recorded. Eberhart and Russell (1966) and GGE Biplot analysis method was applied for data analyzing. The result showed that all of clones were stable over years in each location except for PGL1 and PGL3 in Andongsili and PGL15 in Kayulandak based on Eberhart and Russell analysis. Significant regression coefficient (1.18) of PGL3 implied that PGL3 was high in yield and responsive. GGE biplot analysis indicated no ideal genotype for each location. PGL10, PGL3, PGL4 and PGL 12 were recommended for Kayulandak, while PGL3 and PGL12 clones were suitable for Andongsili. Both analysis of Eberhart and Russell and GGE biplot showed PGL3 and PGL12 as ideal clone, while PGL10, PGL4, and PGL 15 clone were desireable clones. © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

The objective of current research was to determine the effect of coal fly ash-chicken manure mixture application on P use efficiency by corn (Zea mays L.) on Ultisols. The research was arranged according to Factorial Completely Randomized Design with three replicates. The treatments tested were the rates of FA-CM mixture (w/w of 1:1) which consisted of 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 tons ha-1, and P fertilizer rates that consisted of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 times of P requirement to achieve 0.2 μg P mL-1 in soil solution (equivalent to 0, 87, 174, 261 and 348 kg P2O5 ha-1). Results of current research showed that P use efficiency by corn on Ultisols had been increased through the addition of FA-CM in combination with P fertilization at the rate of 87 kg P2O5 ha-1. The optimum rate of FA-CM in combination with P fertilizer at the rate of 87 kg P2O5 ha-1 was 28.60 tons ha-1, with P uptake efficiency of 42.41% and agronomic P efficiency of 82.53 mg shoot dry weight/mg P from fertilizer. © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Path coefficient can define coefficient correlation directly and indirectly to gain information about nature relationship between yield component and protein content to grain yield. Research material consisted of 61 selected plants from G39×Ciherang and 66 selected plants from Mentik Wangi×G39 at F4 generation. Plants were planted in Banyumas in May 2011. Number of panicles per plant, panicle length, 1000 g of grain weight, percentage of filled grain per panicle, protein content, and grain yield were correlated by using Pearson correlation and were followed by path coefficient. Number of panicles per plant, panicle length, 1000 g of grain weight, percentage filled grain per panicle, and protein content were used as dependent variable, while grain yield was used as independent variable. The result showed that protein content in both populations was not correlated with all yield components. The numbers of panicles, followed by panicle length, had highest positive direct effect to yield. The number of panicle was a positive mediator variable to yield from another variable. © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Allelopathic properties of itchgrass as representative from different group were determined in bioassay test, the aqueous extract of itchgrass from Chaehom-Lampang area has a strong allelopathic ability on growth of Echino-chloa crus-galli, Bidens pilosa and Lactuca sativa than the other group. Molecular analysis was strongly supported in morphological clustering with bioassay test, specific morphological traits were soft trichomes, dark purple stems and roots which can be used for the preliminary classification of allelopathic ability. This suggests that itchgrass classification by morphological traits is related to the analysis of the genetic relationship of itchgrass with AFLP analysis, that allowing the assessment of bio-diversity of itchgrass and their allelopathic potentials. © 2014, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

Twenty peanut genotypes including two check varieties (Jerapah and Talam 1) were evaluated on dolomite-ameliorated and non ameliorated soil. In the greenhouse, the treatments were laid out in factorial design with four replications, while in the field using strip plot design with three replications. Assessment of tolerance was using Stressed Tolerance Index (STI) according to Fernandez (1992). Results showed that dolomite application at dose equivalent to 0.5 x exchangeable Al was optimal in improving peanut growth, peanut yield and its components grown on acidic soil. Individually, IC87123/86680-93-B-75-55- 1 genotype had highest STI in the greenhouse, but lower in the field. In contrast, GH3 (G/92088/92088- 02-B-2-8-1) and GH 4 (G/92088/92088-02-B-2-8-2) genotypes had low STI in the greenhouse, but high in the field with average yield of 2.47 t ha-1 and 2.62 t ha-1 of dry pods and potential yield of 4.05 t ha-1 and 3.73 t ha-1 of dry pods, respectively. Check varieties (Jerapah and Talam-1) had low STI in greenhouses as well as in the field. There were concluded that peanut genotype of G/92088//92088-02-B-2-8-1 and G/92088//920 88- 02-B-2-8-2 were adaptable and tolerance to acidic dry land, and adaptation and tolerance of peanuts on acidic soil condition were probably controlled by the buffering mechanisms.","Acidic soil; Peanut; Tolerance",,,,,,,,,,,"Ackura, M., Partigoc, F., Kaya, Y., Evaluation of drought stress tolerance based on selection indices in Turkish bread wheat landraces (2011) J. of Animal & Plant Sci., 21 (9), pp. 700-709; Fernandez, G.C.J., Effective selection criteria for assessing plant stress tolerance.

The data were collected using purposive sampling in rubber agroforestry (RA) and secondary forest (SF). The evaluation of species diversity was measured by species richness, Importance Value Index, and Diversity Index. The results indicated SF had high species diversity, while the diversity level of RA was high in Tb Hiran village. The other two villages had RA in moderate diversity level, and the average of basal area in SF was higher than that of RA. Habitat similarity was characterised by the similar composition and structure of vegetation of both RA and SF in Tb Hiran and Tb Kalemei only. The SF in Tb Liting village was similar to RA, but it differs with SF in Tb Hiran and Tb Kalemei villages. The potential of supporting trees for rattan in RA was quite high based on its high species density and the presence of trees with high to extremely high wood density as found in SF. © 2013, Universitas Brawijaya.","Diversity of climbing trees; Rattan; Rubber agroforestry; Secondary forest","Calamus rotang",,,,,,,,,,"Anonymous, (2006) Potential inventory of rattan (in indonesian), , bookI.

It is expected that this combination is able to continuously protect plants from pathogen interference. The research was carried out in type C tidal swamp in Banjar regency of South Kalimantan, from March to November 2011, temperature 29-32oC, and pH 4.0-5.5. The method used was Split Plot design. Biocontrol preparation for both types of endophytic was applied in seeds in 7 days after planting (DAP). Observation on high intensity and plant diseases of planting stage on tidal swamps (taradak, ampak and lacak) was conducted. The results showed that there was a reduction of disease ranging from 58.70 to 87.29%. The application of combination of two biocontrol agents (T. viride PS-2.1 + P. fluorescent PS-4.8), (Fusarium non-pathogenic PS-1.5 + P. fluorescent PS-4.8) and (T. viride PS-2.1+ FNP PS-1.5) isolate gave the best inhibition result, reduced disease intensity, and increased plant height. The result of soil analysis before and after application of endophytic showed that there was an increase in soil fertility with the element addition of N, P, K and pH. © 2013, Universitas Brawijaya.","Endophytic combination; Paddy; Stem rot; Tidal swamp","Fusarium; Rhizoctonia",,,,,,,,,,"Alabouvette, C., Lemanceuau, P., Steinberg, C., Recent advances in the biological control of Fusarium wilt (1993) Pestic.

The study was carried out in four locations and was laid out in a Randomized Block Design consisting of 10 sweet potato genotypes as treatments and two replicates. Obtained data were subjected to combined analysis of variance to determine GxE interaction, followed by stability analysis based on joint regression model of Eberhart and Russell. Research results revealed that genotypes, locations and genotype by location interaction posed significant effect on the observed variables. Most of the evaluated clones were unstable for vegetative growth characters but were stable for tuber yield and yield components. The local clone LB-01 produced the highest mean tuber yield over all locations, averaging at 4.15 kg.plant-1 (~ 46.11 t.ha-1). Two local clones, i.e. ON-06 and LB-01, and the check cultivar Kidal were the most stable clones for tuber yield and yield components across diverse environments.","Growth; Location; Stability; Sweet potato; Yield",,,,,,,,,,,"Adriyaswar, M., Jusuf, M., Evaluation of yield potential of several sweet potato clones and varieties on Gadut Andosol Soil, Bukittinggi (1994) Summary of National Seminar, Research Institute of Food Crops, Sukarami, 4, pp. 139-144. , (in Indonesia); Ashari, S., Basuki, N., Ardiarini, N.R., Growth and yield characters of several sweet potato clones in two locations (1997) Agrivita, 19 (1), pp. 1-5. , (in Indonesia); Bovell-Benjamin, A.C., Sweet Potato: A review of its past, present, and future role in human nutrition (2007) Advances In Food and Nutrition Research, 52, pp. 1-48. , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17425943; Cahyono, B., Juanda, D., (2000) Cultivation and Agribusiness Analysis of Sweet Potato, p. 92. , Kanisius Publishing Inc.

An innovation was made by using the local phosphate deposits with low reactivity processed further to improve their effectiveness for sugarcane. The objective of this study was to investigate the growth, yield and quality of sugarcane as affected by bio-superphosphate (Bio-SP) application on a highly weathered tropical soil. A nine-month field experiment was conducted at Jatitujuh Sugar Mill area, West Java, Indonesia, comparing between sugarcane fertilized with Bio-SP to replace conventional single superphosphate (SP-36) and that fertilized with SP-36. Urea and MOP (Muriate of Potash) were applied at similar dosages as recommended by division of Jatitujuh Sugar Mill Agronomy Research. Bio-SP was formulated by reacting a Central Java Rock Phosphate with liquid culture supernatant (LCS) and phosphoric acid characterized by 33% total soluble P2O5, 23.1, and 10.7 % citric acid and water-soluble P2O5, respectively. The results indicated that Bio-SP at 50% dosage of SP-36 was as effective as the SP-36 in supporting sugarcane growth and improved yield up to 8% as crystal sugar. Further consequence of this finding is that the application of Bio-SP reduced 9.2% of fertilizer cost for sugarcane.","Fertilizer efficiency; Highly weathered soils; Microbial enrichment","Saccharum; Saccharum officinarum",,,,,,,,,,"Alam, S., Khalil, S., Ayub, N., Rashid, M., In vitro Solubilization of inorganic phosphate by phosphate solubilizing microorganisms (PSM) from maize rhizosphere (2002) Int.

Following treatment to replicated plots in standard experimental design, data were collected at harvest for yield quantity and quality. Ginseng plants treated both pre-harvest and a combination of pre- and post-harvest showed market grade increases of 33.3% and 40.0%, respectively. Point of sale gross return for this crop is dependent upon tuber quality, and from these data the economics of these treatments were calculated. Based on stand adjusted yields and quality values, a combination of pre- and post-harvest treatment increased gross income by 57.4%. The second crop showed similar trends in positive responses. In the two blueberry varieties studied, Emerald treated plants showed 96% statistical increase in yield, while Jewel showed 31% increase. At the time of treatment, each variety was in a different stage of flowering. The Emerald variety was in the flowering stage, and Jewel was predominately in the fruiting stage. Both treated cultivars however demonstrated increased yield quantity and quality.

This research was conducted on up-land of sugarcane plantation in Tegalweru village, Dau district, Malang regency. This study tested ten treatments consisting of three treatments using AS fertilizer, six treatments using AS substitute fertilizers that used combination of Urea, Gypsum, and biocompost and one control (no fertilizer). This research used randomized complete block design with three replications. The results showed that the plant growth between the treatment used AS fertilizer and AS substitute was not significantly different. However, the treatment used 400 kg Urea per ha+938 kg Gypsum per ha tended to have the best plant growth and the highest N uptake. For the treatments using AS substitute fertilizer, the higher the application rate was, the higher the soil N and S contents were. The treatments used AS fertilizer due to lower soil pH than AS substitute fertilizer. Based on this research, it can be concluded that the use of alternative fertilizers as a substitute of the AS fertilizer is recommended to reduce an adverse impact on soil fertility.","AS fertilizer; AS substitute fertilizer; Nutrient content; Soil chemical properties; Sugarcane",,,,,,,,,,,"(2007) Sugarcane Cultivition, , www.LSUAgCentre.com, Anonymous. accessed 17 February, 2007; Barry, G.A., Rayment, G.E., Jeffrey, A.J., Price, A.M., Changes in cane soil properties from applications of sugarmill by-products (2001) Proc.

Infected plants showed wilt symptoms occasionally accompanied by leaf blight. This study aims to characterize the causal agent of bacterial wilt and leaf blight of maize observed in Kediri. Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic bacteria were isolated from the diseased tissues. All bacterial strains (KD1A, KB2A, KD1, KD4, KB1) gave positive result both in the hypersensitive response and pathogennicity assays. However, only KD1 and KB1 strains could be re-isolated from the diseased tissues. Based on several physiological and biochemical assays, the bacteria resembled Pantoea agglomerans. Moreover, the strains showed negative result on PCR amplification using HRP1d and HRP3r, a primer pair specific for detection of P. stewartii subsp. stewartii. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence of KD1 and KB1 showed highest homology at 88% and 90%, respectively to P. agglomerans strain DSM 3493 (NR 0419781). The homology values were too low to conclude that the bacteria were similar to P. agglomerans.

This study investigated the effect of irrigation interval and incorporation of clay together with organic matter to sandy soil on soil organic C, N, and K and growth of J. curcas. The rates of clay and organic matter incorporated to top sandy soil were 5% clay + 0.8% organic matter and 10% clay + 1.6% organic matter. Two irrigation intervals tested were 10 day and 20 day. The results found that incorporation of 10% clay + 1.6% organic matter to sandy soil increased soil organic C, total N and exchangeable K which in turn increased the number of leaves and number of lateral branches of J curcas, while irrigation intervals had no effect on all parameters observed.","C organic; Clay; Irrigation interval; Jatropha curcas; Nitrogen; Organic matter; Plant growth; Potassium",,,,,,,,,,,"Abu-Zahra, T.R., Tahboub, A.B., Effect of organic matter sources on chemical properties of the soil and tield of strawberry under organic farming conditions (2008) World Applied Sciences Journal, 5 (3), pp. 383-388; Agarwal, D., Agarwal, A.K., Performance and emissions characteris-tics of Jatropha oil (preheated and blends) in a direct injection compression ignition engine (2007) Applied Thermal Engi-neering, 27, pp. 2314-2323; Ajiboye, G.A., Ogunwale, J.A., Potassium Distribution in the Sand, Silt and Clay Separates of Soils Developed over Talc at Ejiba, Kogi State, Nigeria (2008) World Journal of Agricultural Sciences, 4 (6), pp. 709-716; Akbarian, M.M., Modafebehzadia, N., Bagheripour, M.A., Study of fertilizer (NPK) effects on yield and triglycerids in Jatropha (Jatropha curcas) (2010) Plant Ecophysiology, 2, pp. 169-172; Behera, S.K., Srivastava, P., Tripathi, R., Singh, J.P., Singh, N., Evaluation of plant performance of Jatropha curcas L. underdifferent agro-practices for optimizing biomass-A case study (2010) Biomass and Bioenergy, 34, pp. 30-41; Cleveland, C.C., Reed, S.C., Townsend, A.R., Nutrient Regulation Of Organic Matter Decomposition in A Tropical Rain Forest (2006) Ecology, 87 (2), pp. 492-503; Chantigny, M.H., Angers, D.A., Prévost, D., Vézina, L.-P., Chalifour, F.-P., Soil aggregation and fungal and bacterial biomass underannual and perennial cropping systems (1997) Soil Sci.

In this study, several assays were conducted, including antagonistics assays on agar plate, characterization of the type of antibiosis produced by antagonists and pot experiment in controlling leaf blight disease (Pantoea sp.) using by Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. The results showed that all bacterial strains of Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. have potential in inhibiting the growth of Pantoea sp. by showing the clear zone on the agar plate. The antibiosis types are bactericide or bacteriostatic. On pot experiment all bacterial strains showed the reduction of the disease incidence at the same level compared to streptomycin suphate. All bacterial strains as well as bactericide reduced the disease incidence at 18-24% compared to control (aquades treatment only).

This research aimed to determine the pathotype grouping and the distribution of Xoo isolates of South and Southeast Sulawesi. In order to obtain the information, 61 Xoo isolates of South Sulawesi and 29 isolates of Southeast Sulawesi were evaluated for their pathotype grouping against 5 diffential varieties. Research results showed that in South Sulawesi there were 2 pathotype groups, namely pathotype IV (32.79%) and pathotype VIII(67.21%). Pathotype VIII was widely distributed over the Western and Central areas of South Sulawesi, whereas pathotype IV was widely distributed over the Southern area. In Southeast Sulawesi, it was found 5 pathotypes, namely pathotypes IV (27.58%), VI (10.34%), VIII (13.79%), IX (20.68%), and X (27.58%), with a limited and scattered distribution pattern on several areas.
