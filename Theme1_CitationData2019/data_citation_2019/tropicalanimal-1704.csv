Powdering method of earthworm was done by using formic acid addition. The study was carried out (1) to evaluate the essential amino acid profile of earthworm and earthworm meal, (2) to calculate the value of essential amino acid index (EAAI) of both materials. A modified EAAI equation was developed from the essential amino acid profile of earthworm and earthworm meal. The result showed that essential amino acid of earthworm was dominated by histidine (0.63% of dry matter basis), meanwhile the earthworm meal was dominated by isoleucine (1.98% of dry matter basis). The non essential amino acid of earthworm and earthworm meal was dominated by glutamic acid (1.52% and 3.60% of dry matter basis respectively). The value of essential amino acid index obtained from earthworm meal was higher (58.67%) than those from earthworm (21.23%). It is concluded that powdering method of earthworm by using formic acid addition had higher amino acid balance than earthworm. © 2009 Diponegoro University.

A total of 100 mixed-sexes Lohman chicks were used in the experiment set up with completely randomized design of 5 different doses of turmeric extract given orally start from day-15 to day-35. The chicks given no turmeric extract were used as a control (T0), whereas T1, T2, T3 and T4 were the chicks given turmeric extract of 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg/kg-live BW, respectively. Hemoglobin values of broilers given turmeric extract 800 mg/kg-live BW was significantly higher (p<0.05) at week-3 and week-4, but not at week-5, compared to broilers given turmeric extract with lower doses or control group. Turmeric extract did not affect significantly (p>0.05) the concentration of erythrocytes, the levels of hematocrit as well as FCR and abdominal fat content of broiler. Turmeric extract seemed to be able to improve the digestion and metabolism (of fat) resulted in enhanced production of hemoglobin in broilers. The hypolipidemic effect of turmeric that could hamper its potential to promote the growth of broilers per se might explain why turmeric could not improve the feed efficiency of broiler. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

Gunung Salju, Amban, Manokwari, Papua Barat, Indonesia","The aim of this research was to evaluate the nutrient degradability, in vitro methane (CH4) production of several agricultural and food industry by-products in relation to their chemical composition. Twenty-one samples of 7 feedstuffs from agricultural and food industry by-products consisted of corn straw, potato straw, rice straw, cocoa pod, sago waste, rice bran, soybean curd residue were evaluated by an in vitro gas production and nutrient degradability. The feedstuffs varied greatly in their crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and non-fiber carbohydrate (NFC) contents. Crude protein ranged from 1.5 to 21.8%, NDF from 31.6 to 71.1% and NFC from 1.5 to 50.8%. Among the seven feedstuffs, soybean curd residue had the highest CP content, on the other hand it had the lowest NDF content. Dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) degradability were highest (P&lt;0.01) in soybean curd residue among the feedstuffs. The CH4 production was significantly higher (P&lt;0.01) in rice straw, cocoa pod and corn straw as compared to sago waste. There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.60; P&lt;0.01) between NDF concentration and CH4 production. However, the total gas productions was negatively correlated (r = -0.75; P&lt;0.01) with NDF content. The CH4 production of feedstuff is influenced by NDF content. © 2009 Journal of the Indonesian Tropical Animal Agriculture.

To anticipate this uncomfortable conditions will be given feed supplement (FS) as source of antioxidants (AOX). FS contain mixture pineapple rind meal and antioxidant minerals (AOXM) each 25 ppm Zn and 10 ppm Cu. This experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of feed supplements as antioxidant source on milk quality of dairy goats. Sixteen Etawah dairy goats in the second lactation were used in the experiment that conducted using randomized block design with 4 treatments and 4 replicates. The treatments were R0 (grass + concentrate), R1 (R0 + FS containing 0.04 % AOX), R2 (R0 + FS containing 0.06% AOX), R3 (R0 + FS containing 0.08 % AOX). The data collected were analyzed using Anova. The result of phytochemicals analysis indicated that feed supplement contained flavonoid, polyphenols, sesqiuterpen, mopnoterpen, steroids, quinones and saponins. The results of study showed that there were difference (p<0.05) among treatments on blood and milk cholesterol and milk lactose, but there were no difference (P>0.05) on milk yield, milk fat, milk protein and milk antioxidant. The conclusion of this study was the feed supplements containing 0.08 AOX produced the best response to milk quality of dairy goats. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

GH exert its effect on growth and metabolism by interacting with a specific receptor on the surface of the target cells. Growth hormone receptor (GHR) has been suggested as candidate gene for traits related to meat production in Bovidae. The objectives of this study were to identify polymorphism of GH and GHR genes in buffalo. The 452 DNA samples buffalo were collected from five populations in Indonesia (Siborong-Borong-Medan (65), Lebak-Banten (29), Pandeglang- Banten (180), Semarang-Central Java, and Mataram-West Nusa Tenggara (103)). A gene fragment of the GH|AluI gene at 432 bp located on exon 3 and GHR|AluI gene at 298 bp on exon 10 were successfully amplified by using the techniques of a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and genotyped by PCR-RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) then -SSCP (single strand conformation polymorphism). The results showed no polymorphisms were detected in these genes. All buffaloes tested had LL genotype for locus GH|AluI and AA genotype for locus GHR|AluI. © 2010 De Gruyter Open Ltd.

Experimental animals were 280 unsex crossbred native chickens and powder and extract of dahlia tuber as source of inulin, which were started to be fed on day 22. The present experiment was assigned in a completely randomized design with 7 treatments and 4 replications (10 birds each). The treatments were: T0 (basal diet/BD), T1 (BD+0.4% powder form), T2 (BD+0.8% powder form), T3 (BD+1.2% powder form), T4 (BD+0.39% extract form), T5 (BD+0.78% extract form), and T6 (BD+1.17% extract form). Parameters measured were the number of Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Escherichia coli, intestinal potential hydrogen (pH) (duodenal, jejunal and ileal), rate of passage and daily body weight gain (DBWG). Data were subjected to ANOVA and followed by Duncan and polynomial orthogonal test. The results indicated that feeding inulin derived from dahlia tuber powder and extract form significantly (P<0.05) increased LAB population and DBWG, but decreased Escherichia coli number and intestinal pH, and slow the rate of passage. In conclusion, feeding inulin of dahlia tuber powder was optimum at 0.9% but that of extract is linier until 1.17%. © 2014 Diponegoro University.

LAB was isolated from GIT of broiler and native chickens on selective medium (MRS+0.2% CaCO3). Screening method based on microbiological and biochemical characteristics, antibacterial properties, growth on various temperature, aeration, and agitation, antibiotic sensitivity, and viability on acid pH, gastric juice and bile salt. Thirty nine of LAB isolates was selected from native chicken and 18 isolates from broiler chicken. The selected LAB inhibited Escherichia coli FNCC 0091 growth and grown on 30, 39 and 45°C of temperature, aerobic, anaerobic and agitation conditions. Biochemical identification using API 50 CHL kit revealed that I72 from native chicken ileum as Lactobacillus salivarius and Db9 from broiler chicken duodenum as Pediococcus pentosaceus. All LAB were resistant to Erythromicin, Penicillin G and Streptomycin as tested antibiotics. Both of them have non significantly different of viability on acid pH (1, 2 and 3), gastric juice pH 2 and bile salt which were 91.78% for L. salivarius I72 and 94.48% for P. pentosaceus Db9 (P&lt;0.05). Based on characteristics, both the selected LAB have potentiality as chicken probiotic candidates. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

A total of 168 birds of 21 days old crossbred kampong chickens were randomly allocated into 6 treatments with four replications per treatment. The present experiment was assigned in a completely randomized design with 2 x 3 factorial scheme. The first factor was levels of dahlia tuber powder, namely 0.8% (A1) and 1.2% (A2), and the second factor was levels of Lactobacillus sp., namely none (B0), 1.2 mL (108 cfu/mL/B1) and 2.4 mL (108 cfu/mL/B2). The parameters measured were antioxidant activity, meat calcium and protein mass. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and followed by Duncan multiple range test (P<0.05) when the treatment indicated significant effect. The supplementation of dahlia tuber powder and Lactobacillus sp. significantly (P<0.05) increased antioxidant activity and protein mass of meat. However, calcium mass of meat was not significantly affected by treatments. In conclusion, feeding dahlia tuber powder at the level of 1.2% combined with Lactobacillus sp. at 1.2 mL (108 cfu/mL), can be categorized as the best combination based on the increase in antioxidant activity and meat protein mass.","Crossbred kampong chicken meat; Inulin of dahlia tuber; Lactobacillus sp.",,,,,,,,"Abbas, A.K., Lichtman, A.H., (2009) Basic Imunology: Function and Disorder of the Immune System, , Saunder Elsevier, Philadelphia; (1995) Official Methode of Analytical of Assosiation Official Agriculture Chemistry, , AOAC.

Biological preservations can be conducted by adding antimicrobial substances, such as bacteriocin produced by lactic acid bacteria and has been characterized as biopreservatives. The aims of this research were to evaluate antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin produced by indigenous lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus plantarum 2C12 isolated from local beef and to study the quality of beef meatball with 0.3% bacteriocin as biopreservative at different storage times (0, 3, and 6 days) in cold temperature (4°C), compared to 0.3% nitrite and control (without preservative). The results showed that bacteriocin from L. plantarum 2C12 could inhibit pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella Typhimurium. Bacteriocin was effective as well as nitrite as biopreservatives of meatballs by inhibiting the growth of total microbes and E. coli. The addition of bacteriocin did not lead the physical and nutritional changes in the meatballs. The quality of meatball with bacteriocin treatment conformed with Indonesia National Standard of meatball. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

This paper aimed to determine the level of adoption within the South Sulawesi layer smallholders of a range of standard biosecurity measures. Sidenreng Rappang (Sidrap) regency was chosen as a location of the research, because it was famous as a central of layer smallholders. Total sample was 60 respondents. The sample was chosen through random sampling from two districts which were the most populous of layer smallholders, namely Baranti and Maritengae. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and depth-interview. The data were tabulated and analysed using a simple method of scoring with regard to their biosecurity status. The status of biosecurity was used to know the level of biosecurity adoption. Biosecurity status was obtained based on the adoption of biosecurity measures which consisted of 9 stages: farm inputs, traffic onto farms, distance from sources of pathogens to shed, exposure of farm, biosecurity at farm boundary, biosecurity between farm boundary and shed, biosecurity at the shed door, traffic into the shed and susceptibility of the flock. Using adoption index, this research revealed that biosecurity adoption of layer smallholders in South Sulawesi was classified into a ""partial adopter"". © 2011 Diponegoro University.

PCR-RFLP and sequencing methods were used to detect the polymorphism and nucleotide sequence at Alu-I locus of GH gene. The result showed that Bali cattle from Bali island has one genotype (LL genotype), whereas Bali cattle originating from Lombok island has two genotypes, namely LL and VV genotypes, respectively. The L and V allele frequencies from Bali and Lombok islands were 1.00 and 0.00; 0.99 and 0.01, respectively. The sequencing result of Bali cattle LL genotype showed an AGCT sequence of enzyme Alu-I restriction site.

Blood samples were collected from 28 individual cattle and 12 microsatellite primers as recommended by FAO were used to identify the genetic characterization of the SO cattle population. Data of carcass productivity were collected from 506 individual cattle that slaughtered in Karawaci abattoir, Banten, Indonesia. The heterozygosity values of microsatellite loci ranged from 0.143 to 1.000 (mean 0.536). The highest PIC values was 0.814 (locus TGLA122), while the lowest was 0.280 (locus BM1818). Cattle in range of 351-475 kg slaughter weight was most slaughtered in year 2013 and 2014 with carcass percentage ranged from 52.89% to 53.43%. The highest carcass percentage (56.34%) was obtained from cattle in range of 626-650 kg slaughter weight while the lowest (51.42%) was obtained from cattle in range of 250-275 kg slaughter weight. The results of genetic characterization showed that all microsatellite locus were highly polymorphic and highly informative for detecting the level of genetic diversity in the SO cattle population. The results of carcass productivity showed that the SO cattle has excellent potential as beef cattle compare with other local breeds cattle in Indonesia. © 2015 Diponegoro University.

Sixty female quails were assigned into a completely randomized design with four treatments (levels of turmeric powder i.e., 0; 13.5; 27; and 54 mg/quail/day) and each treatment used 15 quails. The treatment was conducted for 60 days. Parameters measured were proximate analysis and the quality of the first layed eggs. At the end of the experiment, serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, abdominal and pectoral fat weights, and feed consumption were measured. Chemical analysis showed that turmeric powder contained 7.97% curcumin. Supplementation of turmeric powder lowered serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, egg fat and protein contents, haugh unit and yolk index, but did not affect feed intake, abdominal and pectoral fat weights, egg weight, eggshell weight, eggshell thickness, and egg shell index. However, quails supplemented with turmeric powder showed a variation in egg laying delay ranging from 1 to 16 days. Quails supplemented with 54 mg/d turmeric powder had the highest follicles hierarchy. It was concluded that supplementation of turmeric powder with the level of 54 mg/quail/day decreased lipid content of the egg and improved the other egg quality parameters. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

The purpose of this research was to provide information on the undegraded protein supplementation to increase milk production and composition in dairy cows. The research was conducted for 3 months in Boyolali-Central Java. The study used 20 lactation cows (<3 months of lactation), aged 3 to 3.5 years with body weight from 350 to 400 kg. The cows were then randomly divided into 2 groups of ten based on their body weight, milk production, lactation period and age. The first group (control) and the second group (treated), both were fed diet based on NRC (1987). The second group was added undegraded protein (UDP) of 30 g/l milk that mixed by concentrate. The observed variables were dry matter intake (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), milk production and milk composition including fat, protein and solid non fat (SNF). Data obtained were examined by t-test. The results showed that intake of DM, OM, and the NDF of treated and control groups were not different (9.57; 8.49; 4.98 vs 9.44; 8.38; 5.40 kg/cow/d, respectively); however, protein intake of treated group was higher (P<0.01) than that of the control group (1097 vs. 1210g/cow/d). Milk production of cows receiving UDP supplementation tended to be higher than that in the control group (+ 1:45 kg/cow/d). Although they tended to be lower in fat (4.13 vs. 3.88%), protein (2.45 vs. 2.27%) and SNF (7.26 vs. 6.94%), but protein and fat production were higher for cows receiving UDP supplementation (366 each; 214 vs. 330; 196g/cow/d). It can be concluded that UDP supplementation increased milk, fat production and milk protein but it tended to reduce the level of fat, protein and SNF milk. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

Goats had average of body weight of 18 kg and aged at 18 months. Animals were housed in metabolic cages and were alloted to a completely randomized design receiving three experimental diets with sugarcane bagasse portions of 15, 25, and 35% (dry matter basis), respectively. After eight weeks of adjustment period to experimental diets and environment, each group of treatment was subjected to ten days of digestion trial, and followed by collection of rumen liquid samples. Parameters observed were feed digestibility, nitrogen retention, ruminal feed fermentation, and excretion of urinary allantoin to estimate microbial protein synthesis. Data were tested using one way analysis of variance, and followed by Duncan's mulitiple range test. Dry matter and protein intakes lowered (P<0.05) as the increasing of sugarcane bagasse in diets. Protein digestibility and retention were unaffected by the treatment of bagasse portion. The dietary treatment did not change ruminal ammonia, total VFA, acetate, propionate, and butyrate concentrations. Microbial nitrogen synthesis and efficiency of microbial nitrogen synthesis were unaffected by the dietary treatment. © 2014 Diponegoro University.

The rate of reproduction and productivity of the dam were estimated using Amir and Knipscheer methods and were statistically analyzed using General Linear Model. The results showed that the total birth and weaning weight of Boer goats were higher (P<0.05) than that of Kacang goats, while litter size of Boer goats were higher (P<0.05) than that of Kacang goats. The pre-weaning mortality of Boer goat 15.1 ± 6.02% was lower than that of Kacang. The kidding interval of Boer goats was higher (P<0.05) than that of Kacang. Parity of dam had significant effect on all production traits (P<0.05) except for pre-weaning mortality. Dam reproduction rate of Boer (1.81) was higher than that of Kacang (1.78), while productivity of Boer goat (37.12 kg/head/year) was higher than that of Kacang (18.12). It can be concluded that the reproductivity of Boer and Kacang goats were similar, however the productivity of Boer goat had better than Kacang. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

Rumen fluid was taken from fistulated Ongole crossbreed cattle. The treatments consisted of control treatments (Napier grass with monensin and Napier grass without waru leaf (0% saponin level) and waru leaf supplementation treatments as much as 11, 22, 33, and 44 mg of feed (in dry matter basis) or equal to 5, 10, 15, and 20% saponin level added to feed substrate of Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum). The result showed that protozoa numbers and total gas production were significantly reduced (P<0.05) in line with the increasing of saponin level compared to 0% saponin level, while NH3, VFA concentration and pH after 48 h fermentation were not affected by the treatment. VFA concentration increased by waru leaf up to 10% saponin level then decreased at level 15 and 20%. Ratio of acetate to propionate (A/P) and non glucogenic ratio (NGR) decreased at 5, 10, and 15% saponin level, but increased at level 20%. It could be concluded that waru leaf supplementation at 10% saponin level of feed was the optimum level which gave positive effect on rumen feed fermentation. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

The thirteen groups were subsequent of broiler chickens that were fed diet containing commercial feed supplement as a control (P1), 10 g/kg SAE and 1% LO (P2); 10 g/kg SAE and 1% LO plus 60 mg vitamin E (P3), 10 g/kg SAE and 2% LO (P4), 10 g/kg SAE and 2% LO plus 60 mg vitamin E (P5), 10 g/kg SAE and 3% LO (P6), 10 g/kg SAE and 3% LO plus 60 mg vitamin E (P7), 18 g/kg SAE and 1% LO (P8), 18 g/kg SAE and 1% LO plus 60 mg vitamin E (P9), 18 g/kg SAE and 2% LO (P10), were 18 g/kg SAE and 2% LO plus 60 mg vitamin E (P11), 18 g/kg SAE and 3% LO (P12), and 18 g/kg SAE and 3% LO plus 60 mg vitamin E (P13). The data were analyzed by analysis of variance and if it were significant, it were then determined by Duncan's Multiple Range test. The present results showed that supplementation of SAE and LO significantly affected (P<0.05) fat deposition in abdomen and leg, but it had no effect on neck fat deposition and Fatty Liver Score. Supplementation of SAE and LO had significantly reduced (P<0.05) cholesterol content and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) in leg meat, but it significantly increased (P<0.05) vitamin A and vitamin E and it had no effect on fat in leg meat. Supplementation of SAE and LO proved to change fatty acid composition in leg meat. The treatment highly significant increased ecosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid DHA (P<0.01), arachidonic acid and stearic acid (P<0.05), but it significantly reduced linolenic acid (P<0.05).

Isolation and selection bacteria from buffalo and horse gastrointestinal tract and elephant dung could be found bacteria that have superiority to degrade lignin, xylan, and cellulose. Those animals were chosen because they were herbivores that consume low quality crude fiber as their main energy sources. Lignocellulose degrading bacteria were isolated by Hungate selective media, by using lignin (tannic acid), xylan, and cellulose as selective substrates. The morphological identification used an enrichment media by measuring color, colony size, diffusion zone, clear zone, and biochemical identification using production of ligninase, xylanase, and cellulase enzymes. The best lignocellulose degrading bacteria then was determined by the morphological and biochemical character. This study showed that lignocellulose degrading bacteria could be found in gastrointestinal tract of buffalo and horse, and elephant dung. Highest number colony was found in samples from buffalo's colon (376), followed by horse's cecum (203), elephant's dung (46), buffalo's cecum (23), buffalo's rumen (9) and horse's colon (7). The highest isolates activity of lignolytic, xylanolytic, and cellulolytic were reached by buffalo's cecum (7.64), horse's cecum (6.27), and buffalo's colon (2.48). Meanwhile the highest enzymes productivities were: buffalo's cecum (0.0400 μmol), horse's cecum (1.3912 μmol) and buffalo's colon (0.1971 μmol). Based on morphologycal character and biochemical test, it could be concluded that lignolytic from buffalo's cecum, xylanolytic from horse's cecum, and cellulolytic from buffalo's colon were the superior isolates and they were 99% analyzed as Enterococcus casseliflavus/gallinarum species. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

The mineral feed formula, as treatments, composed of limestone in combination with freshwater oyster shell in five different percent ratios: 100:0; 75:25; 50:50; 25:75 and 0:100. The minerals were mixed in the level of 6 % into basal diet composed mainly corn, rice bran and concentrates. The five experimental diets were then fed to 150 laying hens. They were divided into 5 groups; each group was subdivided into 3 replicates groups containing 10 hens. Parameters measured included: feed intake, egg production, FCR, eggshell quality, Ca and P retention, tibia bone mineralization. Results showed the nutritive values of limestone of Bukit Kamang as mineral source of laying hen diet were found not significantly different from those of oysters shell. The hens fed with diet supplemented with Bukit Kamang's limestone tended to give better laying performances than those of supplemented with fresh water oyster shell. The laying performances, egg shell quality and Ca and P retentions did not significantly improved, when limestone was mixed by oyster shell. © 2009 Journal of the Indonesian Tropical Animal Agriculture.

A total of 18 microsatellite loci have been used for genotyping Indonesian sheep. Total sheep blood 200 samples were extracted from garut sheep of fighting and meat types, purbalingga sheep, batur sheep and jember sheep populations by using a salting out method. Microsatellite loci data were analyzed using POPGENE 3.2 software. Based on this study obtained 180 alleles from 17 microsatellite loci, while average number of alleles was 6.10 alleles (6 to 18 alleles) from five Indonesian sheep populations (garut sheep of fighting type, garut sheep of meat type, purbalingga sheep, batur sheep and jember sheep population). The average of observed heterozygosity (Ho) and expected heterozygosity (He) values were 0.5749 and 0.6896, respectively, while the genetic differentiation for inbreeding among population (FIS), within population (FIT) and average genetic differentiation (FST) were 0.1006, 0.1647 and 0.0712, respectively. Genetic distance and genetic tree showed that Indonesian sheep population was distinct from garut sheep of fighting and meat types, purbalingga sheep, batur sheep and jember sheep population. Based on this results were needed a strategy for conservation and breeding programs in each Indonesian sheep population. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

Longissimus dorsi of beef immersed on Kenari shell liquid smoke on the level of dilution 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x, and 5x during 15 minutes with five replicates following Randomized Complete Design. The results showed that the higher level of dilution of liquid smoke kenari shell caused the physical, chemical and sensory properties which get closer to the quality of the control samples. The level of dilution affected almost all the properties, except the water and protein content. It was concluded that the lower levels of dilution caused the more affected into the physical, chemical and sensory properties of beef, except the water and protein content. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

A total of 470 samples of normal mature bull from several breeds were used for population study and 127 bulls from National and Regional AI centre of Indonesia for association study. To amplify, a PCR-RFLP method was used and digested with Pst1 restriction enzyme. The allele frequency of the A and B in Bali cattle were (0.000) and (1.000), respectively. The absence of other allele A suggested that the Bali cattle was monomorphic, while Brahman, FH, Simmental and Limousine were polymorphic. The highest observed heterozygosity were found in Limousine (0.318) and the highest expected heterozygosity were in Simmental (0.420). The higher incident of percentage of sperm abnormalities were found in Simmental, Limousin, Brahman compared to Bali and FH. Among all types of sperm abnormalities, the abaxial and microcephalus were found in highest number. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

The study was committed to a completely randomized design, with 5 treatments, i.e.: T0 (unmarinated beef, as a control), T1, T2, T3, and T4 that beef were marinated in garlic juice for 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes, respectively, at room temperature (25°C). Each treatment consisted of 4 replications. Examination upon experimental parameters was conducted after marinated (and control) beef was stored for 8 hours at room temperature. Total bacteria, total coliform and water holding capacity of beef were significantly (P<0.05) affected by marination with garlic juice. Conversely, cooking loss was not significantly affected (P>0.05) by the treatments. As a conclusion, marination of beef with garlic juice could reduce total bacteria, total coliform, and water holding capacity, but could not reduce cooking loss. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

The results of this study showed that the ADG, DMI, CP and TDN intake, and FCR were not significantly different (p> 0.05). The ADG of Java and OC bulls were 0.58 kg and 0.78 kg, respectively. The averages of DMI, CP and TDN intake were 6.59 kg (2.09% of BW), 0.81 kg and 4.34 kg for Java bulls whereas for OC bulls were 6.42 kg (2.11% of BW), 0.78 kg, and 4.20 kg, respectively. The FCR of Java bulls was 11.49 and those of OC bulls was 9.21. It can be concluded that Java and OC bulls raised intensively and fed concentrate and rice straw had the similar performance. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

Data on reproduction performance were collected from Breeding Centre of Bali Cattle in Denpasar-Bali. Reproductive traits studied were age at first calving (AFC), calving interval (CI) and pregnancy rate (PR). To observe the effect of non genetic factors on the reproductive traits, a mixed model was used because all of the traits studied were measured repeatedly in individuals. The overall means for AFC, CI, PR and preweaning mortality were 43.86±0.70 months, 360.93±4.47 days, 88.44±1.91% and 7.58±1.07%, respectively. The results showed that AFC and PR were significantly (P<0.01) influenced by dam year of birth but mating system had no significant (P>0.05) effect. With regard to CI, dam year of birth and parity affected CI while mating system had no significantly affect (P>0.05) on CI. The preweaning mortality was only affected by the age of dam significantly (P<0.01). The average of reproductive performance and preweaning mortality in Bali Cattle were not depended remarkably on the mating system being practiced. It might be concluded that an improvement in Bali cattle reproductive traits is possible through improving management systems and utilisation of controlled breeding techniques. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

Semen was collected from 5 Timor deer using electroejaculator. Immediately after collection the semen was evaluated macroscopic and microscopically. After initial evaluation, the semen was divided into three tubes and extended with Tris egg yolk with three different glycerol concentrations, which were 10% (TGEY10); 12% (TGEY12) and 14% (TGEY14). The sperm motility, viability, acrosome intact and membrane intact were evaluated in raw semen, after equilibration and after thawing. The results showed that there were no differences (p&gt;0.05) on the sperm motility, viability as well as sperm acrosome intact. Sperm membrane intact in TGEY10 (52.50±5.89%) and TGEY14 (51.50±4.12 %) were higher (p&lt;0.05) than in TGEY12 (49.00±6.58).

The study was conducted from September to December 2008 in Semarang Regency, Central Java, using survey method. Three districts were purposively chosen based on the largest population of dairy cattle in the Semarang Regency. Of the three districts selected, six villages were chosen based on the largest population of dairy cattle. The respondents were chosen randomly using simple random, hence the sample size in this study was 90. Data were gathered through primary and secondary data. The data were analyzed descriptively and statistically. The analysis of LQ (Location Quotient) was used to analyze the potency of dairy cattle agribusiness development, while the multiple regression model was used to determine the factors affecting the potency of dairy cattle agribusiness development, with the following regression equation: Y = a + b1x1 + b2x2 + b3x3 + b4x4 + b5x5 b7x7 b6x6 + + + e, whereas Y = is the production of milk, and x1 to X7, respectively, are x1 (age), x2 (education), x3 (Number of family members), x4 (number of lactating cows), x5 (amount of feed, forage), x6 (amount of feed concentrate) and X7 (calving interval). The results showed that the potency of dairy cattle agribusiness development in Semarang Regency is potential (LQ&gt; 1) with the value of 4.67 and LQ Population GDP = 1.71. This study indicated that socio, economic and demographic resources are important factors that can help develop and improve dairy cattle farming. Meanwhile, there were significant relationships between 7 independent factors and the potency of dairy cattle agribusiness development, with the following regression equation: Y = -6.082 + 0.032 x1 + 0.223 x2 + 0.717 x3 + 9.221 x4 + 0.067 x5 x6 + 0.486 - 0.323 X7 + e. Moreover, the value of R2 = 0.886, it is indicated that 88.6% of the variation in the the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variable, only 11.40% can be explained by other variables. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

The objective of this study was to assess different CPAs on stallion semen cryopreservation. Skim milk (SM) and Dimitropoulos (DV) were the extenders used in this study; each was added by glycerol (Gly), combination of ethylene glycol-glycerol (EG+Gly) or dimethilformamide (DMF). Each semen sample was evaluated and divided equally into six tubes; semen in the three tubes was diluted 1:1 with (SM), while in the remaining tubes the semen was diluted 1:1 by DV. After being diluted, all tubes were centrifuged at 1006xg for 10 minutes. The supernatan discarded, the pellet was rediluted by SM trehalosa or DV trehalose, and added by G, EG+Gly, or DMF to reach the final sperm concentration of 200x106/ml. The extended semen was individually packed in 0.3 ml minitube, equilibrated at 4°C for 2 hours, frozen in liquid nitrogen vapor for 10 minutes, and then was stored in liquid nitrogen container at -196°C. After 24 hours, the semen was thawed at 37°C for 30 second. There were no significantly different (p&gt;0.05) on the percentages of motile and viable sperm in SMT (21.7% and 43.4%, respectively) compared with those extended with DV T extender (26.9% and 50.8%, respectively). DMF demonstrated better results as CPA compared to the others; and DVTDMF combination had the best protection during cryopreservation in this study. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

A performance test was conducted using 25 males and 25 females of Sumba Ongole (SO) cattle. The performance test were conducted in three periods (2014, 2015 and 2016) for about 535 days. Descriptive statistics ws used to analyze data of body weight. Cattle with age between 300 to 600 days were used for evaluation. Result showed that heritability value of yearling weight (YW365) was 0.77±0.68 as a high category. The highest breeding value of YW365 were 66.05 kg (male) and 41.89 kg (female). The average of corrected final weight (CFW) weight were 172.55±34.22 kg (male) and 159.80±37.73 kg (female).

Forty eight layer chickens aged 72 weeks (strain Dekalb Warren) were distributed into six treatment groups. One group of laying hens was fed diets without Sauropus androgynus leaf extract (SALE) as the control, and another five groups were fed diet supplemented to 9 g SALE, 18 g SALE, 27 g SALE, 36 g SALE, and 45 g SALE/kg diet, respectively. Completely randomized design was used in the present study. The experimental results showed that SALE supplementation had no effect on egg production, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, egg weight, yolk weight, albumen weight, shell egg, egg index, eggshell thickness, and yolk index (P>0.05), but significantly affected Haugh Unit, albumen index, yolk color, egg odor, egg taste, and yolk color (P<0.05). The protein, fat, calsium, phosphor, kalium and iron contents of eggs did not change (P>0.05), but the cholesterol content of egg was significantly reduced (P<0.05). In conclusion, the supplementation of SALE did not enhance performance, but it improve egg quality and its chemical composition.","Egg composition; Egg quality; Performance; Sauropus androgynus leaf extract",,,,,,,,"Agustal, A., Harapini, M., Chairul, Analisis kandungan kimia ekstrak daun katuk (Sauropus androgynus (L) Merr dengan GCMS (1997) Warta Tumbuhan Obat Indonesia., 3 (3), pp. 31-33; Andarwulan, N., Kurniasih, D., Apriady, R.A., Rahmat, H., Roto, A.V., Bolling, B.W., Polyphenols, carotenoids, and ascorbic acid in underutilized medicinal vegetables (2012) J.

Goats had body weight average of 16 kg and aged at 7 months. The experimental diets were: T0 = total mixed ration (0.9% saponin of hibiscus leaf, 8% CP, 62% TDN), T1 = T0 + 3% soybean meal protein, T2 = T0 + 6% soybean meal protein, and T3 = T0 + 9% soybean meal protein. The treatments were allocated in a completely randomized design. The parameters observed in this study were dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) intakes, DM and CP digestibilities, ruminal amonia and VFAs concentrations, blood urea level, nitrogen retention, digestible organic matter in rumen (DOMR), urinary allantoin, and estimated microbial nitrogen (N) synthesis. DM intake, DOMR, urinary allantoin and estimated microbial N synthesis were not affected significantly (P>0.05) by treatments. CP intake, DM and CP digestibilities, ruminal amonia and VFAs concentrations, blood urea level and nitrogen retention increased (P<0.05) with increasing levels of soybean meal protein.

Solvents used for extraction were water, methanol, acetone and their combinations. Tannin and saponin extracts were added into each incubation bottle containing Brachiaria humidicola grass and Indigofera sp. legume (1:1 w/w) according to the following treatments (in four replicates): R1: control substrate, R2: R1 + 0.5 mg/ml tannin extract, R3: R1 + 1 mg/mL tannin extract, R4: R1 + 0.5 mg/mL saponin extract, R5: R1 + 1 mg/mL saponin extract, R6: R1 + 0.5 mg/mL tannin extract + 0.5 mg/mL saponin extract, and R7: R1 + 1 mg/mL tannin extract + 1 mg/mL saponin extract. Results revealed that 75% water + 25% methanol was the best solvent to extract tannins from S. mahagony whereas 100% methanol was the best to extract saponins from S. rarak. The highest gas production and the lowest methane emission were obtained in R7. It can be concluded that combination of tannin and saponin extracts were potential in mitigating ruminal methane emissions. © 2014 Diponegoro University.

The material used was cranium from female Kejobong, Kacang and Ettawa Grade goats, aged for about 4 years (determined on the basis based on eruption of teeth), the number of specimens were 30; 10 and 10, respectively. Twenty seven cranial measurements used to data observed, multivariate analysis of GLM, CANDISC, PRINCOMP and DISCRIM were used to analysis all data observed. UPGMA of MEGA 5 was used to illustrate the distance among breeds. Results showed that Ettawa Grade tended to show the largest size, followed by Kejobong and Kacang goats. Kejobong goat showed small cranium size with large cranium shape. Different things was found in Kacang goats in which cranium size and cranium shape are relatively small. Kacang breed showed the smaller size (Principal Component I or PC-1 = -2) compared to Ettawa Grade (PC-I = 3) and Kejobong goat (PC-I = -1). Analysis for classifying three breeds of local goat resulted in high accuracy (100%) as indicated by 0% of erroneous level (0%).

The treatments were allocated according to a completely completely randomized block design. Results demonstrated that diet containing PUFA supplemented with 5 g yeast and 20 g curcuma were high in total fatty acid, medium chain fatty acid (MCFA), and long chain fatty acid (LCFA). Milk of goats with this treatment showed high in mono unsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and MUFA; while it was low in short chain fatty acid (SCFA), n6/n3 ratio, and atherogenicity index. These qualities were optimally considered good in terms of healthier product. Therefore, the PUFA- diet with 5 g yeast and 20 g curcuma was a reasonable choice to be applied for dairy goat. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

Blood sample was taken from 50 Magelang ducks and 20 of each native ducks. Morphological characteristics of body measurement, production ability and egg quality of Magelang duck were analyzed using Completely Randomized Design with 11 plumage colors as treatments. PCR technique was administered to amplify fragments in mtDNA D-loop region and PCR products were digested with endonuclease restriction enzyme AluI and HaeIII. The result showed that morphology diversity of Magelang duck was statistically affected by different plumage colors. PCR-RFLP analysis using AluI and HaeIII restriction enzyme resulted in six combinations of restriction fragment pattern shown in six haplotypes (A, B, C, D, E and F). Haplotype difference showed genetic diversity in the population of Magelang duck and the other native ducks. In conclusion, the different plumage colors affected morphology diversity of Magelang duck. Genetic diversity of Indonesian native duck population could be identified by using PCR-RFLP analysis on mtDNA D-loop region. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

The objective was to analyze income over feed costs (IOFC) based on locally available feedstuffs to increase liveweight gain. The study was conducted during July-September 2010 and January-March 2011, representing relative dry and wet season. The breeds were PO and Limousin and Simmental crossed with PO (LimPO and SimPO). Small-scale farmers owning 1-2 bulls and medium-scale farmers fattening 10-20 bulls in one period. Fattening period was 58 and 46 days, respectively for dry and wet season. Monthly measurements included liveweight, feed intake, input and output prices. Mean values of growth rates and IOFC were compared using t-tests. The results indicated that, for small-scale operations, SimPO bulls gave a significantly higher return than either PO or LimPO bulls. Likewise, LimPO gave a higher IOFC than SimPO in medium-scale operations. Small-scale farmers achieved equal or higher IOFC for European-cross than medium-scale farmers in both seasons. This reflects that cash outlays for feed were about two-thirds that of medium-scale operations while daily growth rates were similar. Small-scale fattening operations using European-cross can be financially competitive with medium-scale operations in both wet and dry seasons. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

The records that could be used for analysis were 373 out of 1221 heifers, having completed data from birth to first mating period. Three different models i.e, Logistic, Gompertz, and von Bertalanffy were performed to analyze the growth rate of heifers. The results showed that the three models had different accuracy and heavily depend on age, environment and duration of recording. The body weights of sexual maturity and on certain ages were affected by the duration of recording. The Gompertz model was performed as the simpliest model in form of calculation. On the other hand, the Logistic was more difficult to calculate. All models indicated high accuracy with the determination coefficient (R2) more than 90%.

Five districts (Rembang, Blora, Grobogan, Boyolali and Wonogiri) were purposively chosen based on the value of Location Quotient (LQ). The study was conducted using quota sampling method. Forty respondents of each district were chosen randomly using quota sampling. Data were analyzed through Structural Equation Model (SEM). The results showed that each subsystem agribusiness had adequate potential score. The score of 0.693, 0.721, 0.684, 0.626, and 0.691 were given for up-stream subsystem, on-farm, down-stream subsystem, marketing and supporting institution, respectively. The results showed that the SEM model was feasible with Chi-Square value=0.952; RMSEA=0.000; Probability =0.621 and TL1=1.126. The significant results of Critical Ratio (CR) were: up-stream subsystem to the on-farm agribusiness; on-farm subsystem to down-stream agribusiness; down-stream subsystem to the farmer's income; marketing subsystem to the up-stream agribusiness and Supporting Institution to the marketing subsystem and down-stream agribusiness. The conclusion of research indicated that the implementation of beef cattle subsystem agribusiness had adequate index and give positive effect to the beef cattle agribusiness. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

A total of 120 female and 24 male birds were equally divided into two groups of Kedu and Cemani, with average body weight of 1890+216.79 and 1830+396.23 g, respectively. Basal ration was based on the diet formulated by the farmer (R1) consisting of corn (30%), rice bran (50%), protein concentrate (15%), and premix (5%). Dietary treatments evaluated were R1 (without additional Vitamin E), and the other three were the inclusion of DL α-tocopheryl acetate into the R1 diet up to 2 (R2), 4 (R3) and 6 IU (R4). The experiment was arranged in a Randomized Block Design with 4 treatments, and 2 different groups of hen (Kedu and Cemani) were assigned as block. Parameters observed were feed consumption, hen day production, feed conversion ratio, egg quality, fertility, and hatchability. The result showed that Vitamin E supplementation did not affect whatever parameters, except egg fertility. Egg hatchability between Kedu and Cemani hens was significantly different (p<0.05). Trend comparison test indicated significantly linear (p<0.05) for fertility and hatchability. In conclusion, Vitamin E supplementation up to 6 IU increased linearly egg fertility and hatchability of about 5-8%, and egg hatchability of Kedu hens was higher (11%) than that of Cemani. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

The research was conducted by using a survey method. Five districts were purposively selected in three base areas and two non-base areas of beef cattle in Central Java Province, Indonesia. Twenty beef cattle groups were selected based on the largest cattle population managed and their performance, while 196 respondents were randomly selected. Farmers' decision to increase beef cattle business scale was determined using a probit model. Result of the research indicated that the number of family labor and expectation to increase income had a significantly positive influence on the farmers' decision to increase beef cattle business scale. It meant that if the total number of family labor increased, so did the farmers' decision to increase the beef cattle business scale. Also, if the expectation to revenue increased, so did the farmers' decision to increase the beef cattle business scale. On the contrary, education level and business risk had negative significant influence on the farmers' decision to increase the beef cattle business scale with the significance levels of 1.1 and 0.84, respectively. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

Semen was collected from 5 FH bulls using an artificial vagina. The semen were evaluated macroscopic and microscopically. The semen divided into three tubes and extended with Tris egg yolk (TEY), Citrate egg yolk (CEY) or Citrate fructose egg yolk (CFEY). Extended semen was stored at 5 oC and evaluate daily for sperm motility and viability. There was no significant differences (P>0.05) on the sperm viability among three extender, for every time observation during 144 hours of storage. This similar finding found on the sperm motility in all extender for 48 hours of storage. The sperm motility in TEY demonstrated significantly greater (P<0.05) than in CFEY and CEY extender at 72 to 120 hours storage. In the end of storage, sperm motility in TEY (35.2 ± 4.1%) and CFEY (33.5 ± 2.71%) extender statistically indicated no significant different, and both were greater than CEY.

The purpose of this study was to study whether ram spermatozoa within epididymides stored at 4°C for 24 and 48 h remain their motility and viability. The characteristic of ram epididymal spermatozoa after freezing and thawing was also observed. Six pairs of ram testes with attached epididymides were used in this study. The motility of control spermatozoa was well maintained throughout the dilution procedure (83.3±1.1, 80±1.3, and 80±1.3% for collection, Niwa and Sasaki freezing -1 extender (NSF-1 and NSF-2 groups respectively); but declined (P<0.05) after freezing and thawing (38.3±3.1%). Motile and viable spermatozoa could be recovered from epididymides up to 48 h of storage, although their quality declined significantly (P<0.05) as post-mortem storage time increased (motility: 83±1.2, 67±3.0, and 46±5.1; viability: 84.2±2.4, 73±2.8, and 66.6±2.6 % for control, 24 h and 48 h group respectively). These data indicate that ram epididymides could be stored at 4° C for 48 h when epididymal spermatozoa cannot be immmediately collected and cryopreserved. These storage conditions might be possible to use for epididymal sperm recovery in wild ruminants. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

A total of 267 individual DNA samples were used in the Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. The SO cattle growth parameters data (n=44) including birth weight (BW), weaning weight at 205 days of age (WW205), yearling weight at 365 days of age (YW365) and also dressing percentage (DP) (n=122) were investigated in this study. There were three genotypes (AA, AB, and BB) of the GH gene based on the PCR-RFLP analysis with allele frequency was 0.87 and 0.13 for A allele and B allele respectively. The highest genotype frequency in the SO cattle is AA (0.76) and the lowest is BB (0.02). The Heterozygosity Observed (Ho) value in the SO cattle population is 0.23 and Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) value is 0.20. Therefore, the genetic diversity in the SO cattle based on the GH gene polymorphism is quite low. There is no association (P&gt;0.05) in BW, WW205, YW365, and DP with genotypes of the GH gene. As the result, the GH gene in this study cannot be used as a genetic marker in the SO cattle breeding program.","Association; Carcass; Growth; Growth hormone; Sumba Ongole",,,,,,,,"Agung, P.P., Anwar, S., Wulandari, A.S., Sudiro, A., Said, S., Tappa, B., The potency of Sumba Ongole (SO) cattle: A study of genetic characterization and carcass productivity (2015) J.

Rice straw was subjected to the following treatments: RS1: untreated rice straw (control), RS2: RS1+1% urea (no incubation), RS3:RS1+1% urea (4 weeks incubation), RS4: RS2+autoclave 30 min, RS5: RS3+autoclave 30 min, RS6: RS2+autoclave 60 min, RS7: RS3+autoclave 60 min. The samples were analyzed for fiber contents and incubated in vitro. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and Duncan's post-hoc test. Results showed that urea treatments (RS3-RS7) did not change NDF and ADF contents of rice straw in comparison to control. Urea treatment in autoclave for 30 min (RS4) increased rice straw IVDMD and IVOMD by 23.3% and 25.6% as compared to control, respectively (P&lt;0.05). Extension of the incubation period to 60 min (RS6) did not improve further the IVDMD and IVOMD. Treatments did not change pH values and NH3 concentrations. Urea treatment (RS3-RS7) increased total VFA concentration in comparison to control (P&lt;0.05). It was concluded that urea treatment using autoclave for 30 min may replace conventional urea treatment to improve nutritional value of rice straw.","Digestibility; Fiber; Rice straw; Rumen; Urea treatment",,,,,,,,"Agbagla-Dohnani, A., Noziere, P., Clement, G., Doreau, M., In saccco degradability, chemical and morphological composition of 15 varieties of european rice straw (2001) Anim.

Twelve early lactating Friesian Holstein cows were divided into two groups (control and HRUP). Both control and HRUP group were fed on a basal diet (forage to concentrate ratio was 60:40; DM basis), with rumen undegraded protein (RUP) levels were 27.47% and 32.78% for control and HRUP, respectively. The experimental diets were given to animals twice daily, morning and afternoon. Water was given by ad libitum. The observed parameters were nutrient intake, quantity and quality of milk production . Data were examined using t-test. Results showed that feed intake, milk production and 4% FCM, milk fat and lactose concentrations, and milk solid non-fat and total solid concentrations were not differed significantly between control and HRUP groups. However, milk protein concentration and production were differed (P<0.05) between controls and HRUP groups. The balanced energy and protein supplementation with HRUP in early lactating dairy cows could impact on milk protein concentration and production.","Dairy Cows; High Rumen Undegraded Protein; Milk Production and Quality; Supplementation",,,,,,,,"Agle, M., Hristov, A.N., Zaman, S., Schneider, C., Ndegwa, P.M., Vaddella, V.K., Effect of dietary concentrate on rumen fermentation, digestibility, and nitrogen losses in dairy cows (2010) J.

One hundred and twelve broilers were distributed to 7 treatment groups. One group was fed diets without Sauropus androgynus leaves as the control, and other six groups were fed Sauropus androgynus leaves fermented by Neurospora crassa, Lactobacillus sp. or Saccharomyces cerevisiae at level of 25 g or 50 g/kg diet. Experimental results showed that the treatments had no effect on cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and atherogenic index, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDLc) and triglyceride concentration (P>0.05). It was shown that fermented Sauropus androgynus leaves significantly affected red blood count (RBC), white blood count (WBC), packed cell volume (PCV), trombosit dan erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (P<0.05), but it had no effect on haemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), dan mean corpuscular volume (MCV). It was concluded that Sauropus androgynus leaves fermented by Neurospora crassa increased trombocyte number. Fermented Sauropus androgynus leaves had no beneficial effect on lowering blood triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations, and atherogenic index in broiler chickens.

Five identical continuously fed digesters were used. The experiment was run for four times hydraulic retention time (HRT). Data were statitically analysed using the data Analysis Tool Pack available with the Microsoft Excel program. Different ammonia levels were obtained by pulsing urea to obtain the target level of TAN and FA, and to subsequently maintaining the concentration of ammonia levels by daily urea additions. The result showed a strong negative correlation between both TAN and FA concentrations and methane yield. The methane yield was reduced by 24, 30, 52 and 66% in digesters that had TAN levels of 2.9, 3.6, 4.4 and 5.1 g/L, respectively, corresponding to 0.7, 1.1,1.5 and 1.8 g/L FA. Total volatile fatty acid and especially isovaleric and isobutyric acid concentrations were elevated during ammonia inhibition. Concentration of TAN in the biogas digester exceeding 3 g/L indicating that very often the full biogas potential is not achieved due to ammonia inhibition and that longer HRT should be used to compensate or a lower process temperature should be chosen. © 2014 Diponegoro University.

Three breeds of rabbit, namely Indonesian Local Rabbit (IL), Flamish Giant (FG) and Rex (R) were used in the study. Individual body weights of each breed was measured from birth to 63 days of age with 3-days interval. Those periodical data were separated into different sex, be then it was averaged to analysis growth pattern. Growth curve parameters were estimated to fit growth data. There was no difference in body weight between sexs within breed. Indonesian local rabbit had the lowest body weight. The results showed that growth curve paramaters among three breeds were significantly different (P&lt;0.05) for both sexes. FG had the highest value of asymptotic mature weight, followed by R and IL.

Saline soil used in this research was classified into strongly saline soil with low soil fertility. The research was arrranged in randomized complete block design with 3 blocks. The treatments were : M1 = Guinea grass monoculture, without mulch; M2 = Guinea grass monoculture, 3 ton/ha mulch; M3 = Guinea grass monoculture, 6 ton/ha mulch, M4 = mixed cropping grass with Sesbania grandiflora, without mulch; M5 = mixed cropping grass with Sesbania grandiflora, 3 ton/ha mulch; M6 = mixed cropping grass with Sesbania grandiflora, 6 ton/ha mulch. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance, then followed by Duncan's Multiple Range Test. The highest soil moisture content was achieved at mixed cropping grasslegume with 6 ton/ha of mulch. The effect of mulch at saline soil significantly increased plant growth, forage yield and nutritional quality of Guinea grass. Application of 3 ton/ha mulch increased plant growth, forage yield and nutritional quality of Guinea grass.

Six of plant leaves i.e. Gliricidia sepium, Acacia mangium, Leucaena leucocephala, Desmodium intortum, Camellia sinensis, Calliandra calothyrsus and seed of Areca catechu were extracted by using water. Experimental treatments consisted of P. purpureophoides (300±5 mg) incubated alone or added with 1.2 mL of plant extracts. The in vitro neutral detergent fibre (NDF) degradability was determined using the first stage technique of Tilley and Terry. The results showed that total tannin concentration of plant extract ranged from 34 to 95 g/kg DM, and was lowest in D. intortum and highest in A. mangium. Methane production was significantly (P<0.001) lower with addition of A. mangium, L. leucocephala, A. catechu, C. sinensis and C. calothyrsus extracts compared to control. Total tannin had a close relationship with CH4 production (r=-0.79). There was strong correlation between CH4 production and NDF degradability (r=0.61). It was concluded that water extracts of A. mangium, L. leucocephala, A. catechu, C. sinensis and C. calothyrsus have potential to be used as rumen manipulator in order to reduce CH4 production in ruminants. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

Eighteen of local cattle were kept for 58 days by feeding concentrates and rice straw. The measured parameters were weekly body weight as well as carcass percentage. The percentage of comparing carcass was taken from PO, Bali and crossbred cattle from local cattle with Limousin, Simmental, Brahman and Angus cattle. Data were analyzed using Excel software and SAS (2004). Blood samples were taken from two subpopulations i.e., 46 and 52 samples from Tambaksari and Cijulang areas, respectively. Other DNA samples were collected from Bali, PO, Limousin, Simental, Brahman and Angus cattle. Genetic diversity and phylogenetic analysis were analyzed using 3 microsatellite loci, that were INRA35, HEL9 and BM2113. The genotyping data were analyzed using POPGENE.32 program, while phylogenetic trees were analyzed by MEGA 4. Average daily gain (ADG) of local cattle in Ciamis was 0.62±0.23 kg/head/day with a carcass percentage was 51.62±1.80%. The carcasses percentage of local cattle in Ciamis was not significantly different from those of Bali, PO, and crossbred cattle. The genetic diversity of local cattle in Ciamis was categorized in the medium level, the diversity of local cattle in Tambaksari subpopulation was higher than in Cijulang subpopulation. Local cattle in Ciamis had a closer genetic distance with the PO cattle. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

The Jatropha curcas meal was fermented using Rizhopus oligosporus. In this study 200 laying hens were used and distributed to 5 treatments and 4 replications in Completely Randomized Design. The diet treatments were: R0 = control diet (without JCM), R1; diet contained fermented JCM 7.5%, R2; diet contained fermented JCM 7.5% + celullase 200 g/ton, R3; diet contained fermented JCM 7.5% + phytase 200 g/ton and R4; diet contained fermented JCM 7.5% + cellulase 200 g/ton + phytase 200 g/ton. The parameters observed were feed consumption, hen day egg production, egg mass production, egg weight and feed conversion ratio. The results showed that feeding fermented JCM 7.5%, both enzyme supplemented as well as unsupplemented significantly decreased (P<0.05) the feed consumption, hen day egg and egg mass production. However, the treatments did not influence the egg weight. Supplementation of cellulase (R2) or phytase (R3) improved the feed conversion ratio with the value as same as the R0 diet. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

Fifty pure isolates of fungi were found from three different ages, those were four days, one week and two months old chicken were 5, 10 and 35 isolates respectively. The largest number of isolate was found in ileum, then followed by caecum, jejenum and duodenum. The fifty isolate of fungi belonged to seven species, those were Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus Niger, Chrysonilia crassa, Mucor circinelloides, Mucor sp, Rhizopus oligosporus and Rhizopus oryzae. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

This experiment was arranged in Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with 5 treatments and 4 replications i.e. 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% of OPF substituting fields grass in complete feed for A, B, C, D and E treatments, respectively. Twenty fat-tailed rams were fed twice at 08.00 and 14.00 with pellet of complete feed for 4 months. The result of this experiment showed that OPF significantly influenced nutrient consumption, average daily gain (ADG) and feed efficiency ratio (FER). Oil palm fronds significantly affected (P<0.05) fat-tailed rams's dry matter intake (DMI), organic matter intake (OMI), crude protein intake (CPI), ADG and FER. The highest DMI, OMI, CPI, ADG, and FER of fat-tailed rams was in C treatment and significantly different from the others. It was concluded that C treatment was the best treatment which can give the best fat-tailed rams performance. The OPF can be used to replace the field grass as feed up to 75% proportion in complete feed and could increase the performance and productivity of fat-tailed rams. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

Reproductive traits studied were age at first calving (AFC), calving interval (CI) and pregnancy rate (PR). Data of reproductive traits were collected from Breeding Centre of Bali Cattle, Denpasar-Bali at the year period of 2000-2007. To evaluate the genetic analysis, heritability were estimated using the Mixed Model Least Squares and Maximum Likelihood procedure. The phenotypic and genetic trends were calculated using regression equation. Estimation of heritability for AFC, CI and PR were 0.22, 0.41 and 0.40, respectively. The phenotypic trend of AFC, CI and PR decreased at an average rate of 1.70 month, 10.4 days and 0.75% per year, respectively. The same pattern was showed for genetic trends for AFC, CI and PR decreased at 0.38 month, 4.25 days and 0.30% per year respectively in the same period. The heritability of reproduction traits in Bali cattle were considered as moderate to high (0.22-0.41) which means that the selection program will be more effective and efficient in improving the genetic merits in Bali cattle. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

This experiment was arranged in Completely Randomized Design with 3 treatments i.e. R1 (grass 0%: FOPF 100%), R2 (grass 50%: FOPF 50%) and R3 (grass 100%: FOPF 0%) and 5 replications. The parameters of the study were feed intake, average daily gain (ADG), weight and percentage of carcass and meat quality. The results indicated that feed intake and meat quality of goat was not affected by treatment, but the average daily gain, carcass weight, and percentage of carcass, was affected by the differences of percentage of FOPF in the pellet complete feed. The best ration was in the R1 ration (grass 0%: FOPF 100%) that significantly different (P&lt;0.05) from the other rations. The feed intake tended to be higher in goat fed R1 (895.87 g/d) compared to those in goat with the R2 (854.38 g/d) and R3 (851.53 g/d). The average daily gain and carcass weight were higher in goat fed R1 ration compared to those in goat fed R2 and R3. Consequently, the carcass percentage in R1 was higher than those in R2 and R3. The carcass percentage was ranged from 38.41-41.38%. The Ribeye area was higher in goat fed R1 (9.73 cm2) than R2 (8.34 cm2) and R3 (7.76 cm2). In this study, the protein content of goat meat was ranged from 19.06 to 20.71%, lipid content was ranged from 0.703 to 1.106% and water content was range from 72.45% to 74.12%, in which were not different among the treatments. It can be concluded that the use of FOPF in a complete feed could improve performance and meat quality of goat. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

Nineteen bodies size of 323 sheeps of five sheep breeds; namely Barbados Black Belly Cross (BC), Garut Local (GL), Garut Composite (GC), Sumatra Composite (SC) and St. Croix Cross (SCC) were measured. Analysis of variance and canonical discriminant analysis, Mahalanobis distance, plotting canonical and dendogram were performed using PROC GLM, PROC CANDISC, PROC CLUSTER and PROC TREE of SAS software ver. 9.0. Index Length, Width Slope, Depth Slope, Balance and Cumulative Index of GC sheep were significantly higher than the four other breeds. Canonical discriminant analysis successfully could differentiate among the five sheep breeds. All five breed were divided into two groups: The first group consisted of SCC, SC and BC; and the second group consisted of the GL and GC. The results of genetic distance estimation showed that the SCC had a value of sheep genetic distance closest to SC (10.83) and BC (27.98), while GL had the closest distance to GC (66.60). The tail width, horn base circumference, horn length (canonical 1) and variable length of the tail and body length (canonical 2) were the breed differentiation variable in this study. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

Ultrasonic estimation of carcass traits such as M. longissimus thoracis area (MLTA), Subcutaneous Fat Thickness (SFT), Inter Muscular Fat Thickness (IMFT), Rib Thickness (RT) and Beef Marbling Score (BMS) were obtained from 92 head of bulls at Barru district and 74 head of bulls at Bone district, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The carcass traits estimation were scanned between the 6th - 7th ribs using ultrasound. The ultrasound is made of Fujihira Super-Eye FHK, Co. Meat. Ltd. with B-Mode and electronic linear probe, which used frequency of 2 MHz. The carcass traits estimation photos were printed by video-copy machine (Aloka Co. Ltd., SSZ-300S). The data obtained were analyzed using basic statistic and was discussed descriptively. The averages of all carcass traits estimation of the Bali bull at Bone district at 12, 18 and 24 months of ages were higher than those at Barru district. The MLTA estimation of Bali bulls at Bone and Barru districts were 18.0 cm2, 24.3 cm2, 23.8 cm2 Vs 16.6 cm2, 18.5 cm2, 23.3 cm2, respectively; the BMS estimated were 0.14, 0.24 and 0.20 Vs 0.00, 0.15 and 0.17, respectively; the SFT estimation were 0.26 mm, 0.33 mm, 0.34 mm Vs 0.28 mm, 0.26 mm, 0.34 mm, respectively; the IMFT estimation were 1.13 mm, 1.24 mm, 1.31 mm Vs 0.97 mm, 1.06 mm, 1.14 mm, respectively; the RT estimation were 2.04 mm, 2.52 mm, 2.72 mm Vs 1.19 mm, 2.12 mm, 2.30 mm, respectively. The growth of MLTA, SFT, IMFT, RT and BMS of the bulls of Bali cattle at the 12, 18 and 24 months of age were not reaching the optimally performances, yet. Therefore the selection process of the bulls of Bali cattle to be candidate of sire based on the estimation of carcass traits should be done after since 4 years of age. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

This condition can even be worse if the environmental temperature is not in comfortable range which may occur especially in tropical regions. The present research was aimed to simulate the effect of supplementary feeding on nutrient balance of lactating dairy cow at contrasting temperature regimes using Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) model. Treatments consisted of feeds (R1: Pennisetum purpureum, R2: P. purpureum + concentrate (60:40), R3: P. purpureum + Gliricidia sepium + Leucaena leucocephala (60:20:20), R4: P. purpureum + concentrate + G. sepium + L. leucocephala (60:20:10:10)) and environmental temperatures (T1: 20oC, T2: 30oC). The dairy cow inputs in CNCPS were Holstein breed, body weight of 500 kg, feed intake of 15 kg (dry matter basis) per day and produced milk 15 kg/day. Based on the CNCPS model, there were negative balances of metabolisable energy (ME) and metabolisable protein (MP) if a lactating dairy cow fed only by P. purpureum. The ME balance was worse at higher temperature, while the MP balance was remain unchanged. Addition of concentrate mixture (R2) fulfilled the ME and MP requirements as well as other nutrients. Addition of leguminous tree leaves (R3 and R4) improved the nutritional status of the lactating cow model compared to R1, but did not better than R2. It was concluded that supplementary feeding is necessary for improving the nutrient balance of lactating dairy cow, especially when the cow is maintained under uncomfortable environmental temperature. © 2009 Journal of the Indonesian Tropical Animal Agriculture.

Increasing law enforcement regarding hunting as well as promoting awareness of the Anoas unique threatened the existence of conservation measures. The modern concept of conservation based on the sustainability utilization, and therefore the knowledge of the Anoa preference in feeding to support the sustainability conservation should be studied. In the present study, the combination of direct observation methods which was done in the Lore Lindu National Park in Toro village at District Kulawi, Central Sulawesi and the epidermal analysis method which was carried out to Anoa's dung were aimed to identify the vegetations preferred by Anoa in their habitat. The result showed 28 species of vegetations was used as feed by Anoa on in situ area. According to its percentage, the first ten were Freycinetia insignis Blume (17%), Microlepia todayensis Christ (8.9%), Disoxylum sp (8.6%), Lasianthus clementis Merr (7.7%), Clusia sp (7.5%), Schleria sp (6%), Podocarpus imbricatus (5.4%), Smilax leucophylla (5.1%), Elastostema sp (4.2%), and Garcinia sp (3.8%), respectively. Furthermore, it can be concluded that Anoa was eat more leafs and shrubs/bushes (each 24%, respectively) compared to flowers (18%), fruits (12%), shoots (8%), grasses, tubers, young grooves (each 4%, respectively) and moss (2%). Nutritionally, Anoa consumed 8.8% protein and 25.6% crude fiber. © 2009 Journal of the Indonesian Tropical Animal Agriculture.

The antibacterial activity of Bacillus strains was assessed against Escherichia coli based on the agar-well diffusion method. To assess the antioxidant-enhancing effect, the Bacillus strains was mixed (prepared as multi-strains) and used to ferment herbal medicine waste (HMW). The effect was compared with that of commercial probiotic Bacillus subtilis and non fermented HWM. Results showed that each Bacillus strain was able to inhibit the growth of E. coli. Fermentation with mixed Bacillus strains tended (P=0.07) to enhance the 2,2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals scavenging activity and total phenolics content of HMW. In contrast, fermentation with commercial Bacillus subtilis tended (P=0.07) to decrease DPPH radical scavenging activity and total phenol of HMW. Fermentation with both Bacillus preparations increased (P<0.05) the contents of crude protein and ash in HMW, while crude fat increased (P<0.05) in HMW fermented with Bacillus subtilis. Fermentation either with Bacillus subtilis or mixed Bacillus strains increased (P<0.05) the fiber content of HMW. In conclusion, Bacillus strains isolated from the rumen content of dairy cows showed antibacterial activity and antioxidant-enhancing effect, therefore, they are potential as feed additive to substitute synthetic antibiotics and antioxidants for broilers raised under tropical conditions. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

The particle was then dissolved in distilled water (1: 4 w/v), and added with 2 mL virgin coconut oil for every 500 mL solution prior to ultrasound transducer (ultrasonic bath) treatment to obtain protein microparticle. Reducing particle size is one possible way to increase protein utilization. 180 birds were used for forced feeding and 10 other birds were plotted for endogenous correction, when they were one month and a half old. Microparticle protein of both ingredients were tested separately in either mash or pelleted forms and compared to intact protein. Completely randomized design with 3 treatments (intact, mash, and pellet) and 6 replications (10 bidrs each) was arranged for the respective ingredient. Protein and essential amino acid digestibilities, and calcium retention were the parameters measured. Analysis of variance continued to Duncan test were applied to statistically evaluate the data. Pelleted microparticle protein of fish meal and soybean meal, respectively, resulted in significantly (P<0.05) highest protein and amino acids digestibilities, and Ca retention although lower disgestibility of fewer amino acids was found in mash form. In conclusion, pelleted form of microparticle protein of either fish meal or soybean meal improve protein and mostly amino acids digestibilities, and calcium retention in broiler. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

The purpose of this research was to identify the MC4R gene in Kebumen Ongole grade cattle and examine its association with growth traits. Data of birth weight (BW), weaning weight (WW), birth body length (BBL), birth chest circumference (BCC), birth shoulder height (BSH), weaning body length (WBL), weaning chest circumference (WCC), weaning shoulder height (WSH) and average daily gain (ADG) were collected and used for analysis of MC4R gene. Sixty blood samples were collected for DNA isolation and PCR amplification. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) g.1133 C>G was used for genotyping by using PCR-RFLP methods. The frequenciy of G allele (0.59) was greater than C allele (0.41). The highest genotype frequencies have been detected in CG heterozygote animals (0.52) followed by GG (0.33) and CC (0.15) in homozygote animals. The results of Pearson 's Chi-square test indicated that the population was not deviate (P>0.05) from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The SNP g. 1133 C>G of MC4R gene indicated affecting high birth body length with GG genotype (P<0.05). In conclusion, the SNP g. 1133 C>G may can be a marker for birth body length of calf selection. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

Insect samples were oven-dried at 60 °C for 24 h, and ground to pass a 1 mm sieve. The ground samples were used subsequently for chemical composition determination and in vitro rumen fermentation test. Incubation was carried out in a water bath maintained at 39 °C for 48 h in three replicates. Results revealed that all insect meals contained high crude protein, i.e. above 40% DM. Proportions of neutral detergent insoluble CP (NDICP) and neutral detergent insoluble CP (ADICP) were high in the insect meals than that of soybean meal (SBM), and these were particularly very high in BSF2. All insect meals had lower IVDMD and IVOMD than that of SBM (P<0.05). All insect meals had lower methane emissions as compared to SBM at 12, 24 and 48 h (P<0.05). It can be concluded that insect meals are potential protein supplements and have low methane emissions in vitro. However, their digestibility is rather low and may limit their utilization.","Black soldier fly; Cricket; Insect; Mealworm; Rumen fermentation",,,,,,,"This research was funded by Indonesian Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education through “Penelitian Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi” research grant, year 2016, contract number 079/SP2H/LT/DRPM/II/2016.","(2005) Official Methods of Analysis, , 18th ed.

PCR-RFLP and sequencing technique was established in the present study to accomplish the polymorphisms of Bone Morphogenetic Protein 15 (BMP15) gene exon 2 on Kejobong goat does. The blood samples was collected from 48 Kejobong does which were selected based on their litter size. The size of PCR amplification of BMP15 gene exon 2 was 837 bp. The product of PCR-RFLP technique digested by HinfI enzyme showed that the samples were monomorphic. Authentication result using nucleotide sequencing found 4 substitution (A391G, C464G, T828C and C830G), 1 alignment gap (site 817) and 1 insertion nucleotide (site 822). This mutations caused 6 haplotypes formatted. The mutants of BMP15 exon 2 on Kejobong goats indicated that this breed had their own mutation controling the prolific trait. The phylogenetic tree build on the sequences of BMP15 gene exon 2 of Kejobong goats was grouped into 3 clusters. The alignment gap indicated to be the specific marker for the prolific trait (duplet) in Kejobong goat. The particular insertion site could be the recognition site of Kejobong goat based on BMP15 exon 2.","BMP15 gene; Fecundity trait; Kejobong goat; Polymorphisms; Prolific",,,,,,,,"Sharma, R.A.S., Maitra, A., Screening of indigenous goats for prolificacy associated DNA markers of sheep (2013) Gene, 517, pp. 128-131; Tiesnamurti, A., Noor, R.R., Farajallah, A., Tiesnamurti, B., Doloksaribu, M., Karakterisasi molekuler enam subpopulasi kambing lokal Indonesia berdasarkan analisis sekuen daerah D-loop DNA mitokondria (2011) JITV, 16 (1), pp. 49-60; Bodin, L., Di Pasquale, E., Fabre, S., Bontoux, M., Monget, P., Persani, L., Mulsant, P., A novel mutation in the Bone Morphogenetic Protein 15 gene causing defective protein secretion is associated with both increased ovulation rate and sterility in Lacaune sheep (2007) Endocrinol, 148, pp. 393-400; Chu, M.X., Liu, Z.H., Jiao, C.L., He, Y.Q., Fang, L., Ye, S.C., Chen, G.H., Wang, J.Y., Mutations in BMPR-IB and BMP-15 genes are associated with litter size in Small Tailed Han sheep (Ovis aries) (2007) J.

The research is conducted with a directional pattern completely randomized design. Eighty-four broiler chickens were raised from day old (DOC) to 42 days old chick. From DOC to 14 days old chicks were fed with commercial feed (ME 3,100 kcal/kg; CP 22%; Ca 1%; P 0.75%). During 15-21 days of age given a commercial feed mixture and basal feed (ME 3,201.77 kcal/kg; CP 20.21%; Ca 0.90%; and P 0.43%). At 22-42 days old given treatments. Seven treatments were replicated 3 times consisted of 4 broiler chickens for each replication. The treatments were positive control (P1), negative control (P2), water + LTE 2% (P3), water + LTE 4% (P4), water + LTE 6% (P5), water + LTE 8% (P6), and water + LTE 10% (P7). The results showed that LTE 10% significantly decreased (P<0.05) on the slaughter weight and 8% until 10% dossage had a significant decrease (P<0.05) on the meat water content. However, it did not show a significant influence (P>0.05) on the carcass weight, carcass percentage, meat protein and fat content.","Broiler chicken; Carcass production; Liquid turmeric extract; Meat; Phytobiotic",,,,,,,,"(2005) Official Method of the Association of Official Analytical Chemist. 12th Edition, , AOAC., Published by the Association of Official Analytical Chemist.

The first experiment was the formulation of three SBBD with similar nutrient content but differed in synchronization indexes (namely 0.36; 0.50 and 0.63). The in sacco nutrient degradability coefficient was used to calculate the synchronization index of each feedstuff. The second experiment was determination of post feeding ruminal pH, ruminal concentrations of total volatile fatty acids (TVFA) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level in sheep fed on experimental SBBD. The third experiment was determination of feed digestibility and estimation of microbial nitrogen synthesis (MNP) on the basis of excreted urinary allantoin. The alteration of dietary synchronization index did not change nutrient intake, but the digestibilities of DM, OM and CP were increased (P<0.05). The post feeding ruminal pH was decreased (P<0.05) but concentrations of post feeding ruminal TVFA and NH3-N, and level of BUN were increased (P<0.05) by the treatment of dietary synchronization index. The treatment of dietary synchronization index improved MNP (P<0.05), although dietary synchronization index at 0.63 lowered the MNP (P<0.05).","Microbial protein synthesis; Nutrient synchronization; Sheep; Sugarcane bagasse",,,,,,,,"(1995) Official Methods of Analysis, , AOAC.

The results showed that hydropic and fat degenerations in the livers of Magelang ducks entering laying phase were still in a normal range. There was an interaction effect between curcumin and monochromatic light on the serum SGPT/GOT and liver MDA concentrations (P<0.05). Serum lipid concentrations positively correlated with the increased serum SGPT/GOT and liver MDA concentrations as indicators of liver damages. Supplementation of curcumin and the use of monochromatic light could reduce and suppress liver destruction and damage during laying period in female Magelang ducks.","Curcumin; Liver histopathology; Local ducks; Monochromatic light",,,,,,,,"Adriani, L., Rochana, A., Yulianti, A., Mushawwir, A., Indrayani, N., Profil serum glutamate oxaloacetat transaminase (SGOT) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) level of broiler that was given noni juice (Morinda citrifolia) and palm sugar (Arenga piata) (2014) Luc.

The birth data record of 48 Sumba Ongole (SO) cows and record data from 52 callf birth's performance were used to estimate the value of MPPA. High of r value (r > 0.30) was obtained at the body length (BL). Birth weight (BW), withers high (WH) and chest girth (CG) had a moderate value (0.10 < r < 0.30) of repeatability. The MPPA value of the cumulative calf birth's performance of cows based on the highest birth records was 4.64 (cow number 3770) and the lowest was -4.64 (cow number 2283). Calf number B2076 (cow number 3586) had the highest ratio of WH (115.70); BL (124.26); CG (118.90), while the highest ratio of BW (168.35) was obtained in calf number B2095 (cow number 3731).

This study was conducted to detect pork contamination in fresh and cooked beef using genetic marker mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b (mt-DNA Cyt b) by duplex-PCR. A total of twelve samples was used in this study consisting six fresh meat samples and six cooked meat samples, respectively. Those beef and pork were bought from animal slaughterhouse and a supermarket in Surakarta. Cooked samples were prepared by boiling the meats in hot water at 100oC for 30 minutes. We designed pork contamination in beef in the level of 0, 1, 5, 10, 25%, respectively. The DNA genome was extracted and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using species specific primer to isolate mt-DNA Cyt b gene from the samples. The results showed that the DNA genome was successfully extracted from pork, beef, and contaminated meat samples. In addition, visualization of duplex-PCR on 1.5% agarose gel was able to detect pork contamination in both fresh and cooked beef up to very small proportion (1%). The existence of pork in beef was indicated with the presence of specific 398 bp DNA band. It can be concluded, duplex-PCR of mt-DNA Cyt b gene was very sensitive in detection of pork contamination in fresh and cooked beef.","Beef; Contamination; Cytochrome b; Duplex-PCR; Pork",,,,,,,,"Aida, A.A., Che Man, Y.B., Wong, C.M.V.L., Raha, A.R., Son, R., Analysis of raw meats and fats of pigs using polymerase chain reaction for halal authentication (2005) Meat Sci., 69, pp. 47-52; Ali, M.E., Hashim, U., Mustafa, S., Che Man, Y.B., Foo, K.L., Nanobioprobe for the Determination of Pork Alduteration in Burger Formulations (2012) J.

The complete mtDNA D-loop sequence of 12 goat blood samples were analyzed from 4 different location in Purbalingga Regency, Central Java province, sub-districts Kejobong, Pangadegan, Bukateja, and Kaligondang. The mtDNA D-loop was extracted from blood sample. DNA obtained were amplified by PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) method using primers (5’-tcactatcagcacccaaagc-3’) as forward and (5’-ggcattttcagtgccttgct-3’) as reverse and subsequently sequenced. After nucleotide sequencing analysis conducted, 548 bp along was obtained. Nucleotides were then aligned with Capra hircus (GenBank Access No.: KF952601.1) and apparently there were 11 different sites on the segment of mtDNA D-loop. Five sites could be used as a specific marker to distinguish between the Capra hircus and Kejobong goat, namely at the site of 317 (A-G), 403 (T-C), 434 (T-C), 537 (C-T), and 553 (A-G). Nucleotide sequence analysis also contained seven different haplotypes.

Eigth male young Kacang goats weights at 12.75±2.68 kg (6-7 months) and male mature goat weights at ± 17.34±3.32 kg (8-12 months) were used in this study. The pelleted complete feed was formulated to give 18,8% of Crude Protein (CP) and 78.82% of total digestible nutrients (TDN). The experiment design was nested design experimental 2x2 with 4 replications. The main factors (based on nested) were young and mature goats and the second factor was low feeding (near maintenance level) and high feeding (2X maintenance). Data measured were daily feed intake, feed digestibilities, ruminal VFA concentration and blood glucose. The data obtained were analyzed by using analysis of variance. The results showed that dry matter intake (DMI), digestible carbohydrates, digestible crude fiber, and digestible organic matter was affected by age (P<0.05), as well as level of feeding (P<0.001), but age and feeding level has no effect on digestibility (P>0.05). Ruminal VFA and blood glucose concentrations were found similar (P>0.05) neither in young and mature goats. However, VFA and concentration on the 3 and 6 h on high feeding as well as blood glucose on 3 h in high feeding were higher than those on low feeding. © 2014 Diponegoro University.

The experiment was conducted in a factorial block design. The first factor was the proportion of forage:concentate in diets (70:30 and 30:70) and the second was addition of tannin and saponin extracts (control, tannins, saponins, tannins + saponins) in the dose of 2 mg/ml. Variables observed were gas production kinetics, methane production, dry matter digestibility (DMD), organic matter digestibility (OMD) and ammonia concentration. Results revealed that addition of tannins, saponins and their combination generally lowered total gas and methane production during 24 and 48 h of incubation period in both types of diets (P<0.05), but combination of tannins and saponins compared with their separated forms did not show any significant differences. The addition of tannins, saponins and their combination reduced DMD, OMD and ammonia significantly (P<0.05). It can be concluded that the addition of tannin, saponin and their combination at a dose of 2 mg/ml could reduce methane emission but followed by a decline in the DMD, OMD and ammonia. © 2014 Diponegoro University.

This research used Lactobacillus acidophilus RRAM-01 and Lactococcus lactis RRAM-01 which had been proven as probiotic, and Saccharomyces cereviceae. Saccharomyces cereviseae was used to produce specific flavor components in koumiss (bacterial fermentation product). The objective of this research was to study the characteristics of goat milk probiotic koumiss added that with roselle extract. The results showed that the addition of different concentration of roselle extract (0%, 0.5%, and 1%) in the goat milk probiotic koumiss had no effect on chemical and microbiological characteristics of koumiss. Goat milk processed into koumiss had ability to suppress the growth of coliform and had strong inhibition activity against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 as tested by agar diffusion test. Microbiological analysis used in this research was the pour plate method. Population of lactic acid bacteria indicated that the product fulfilled standards as probiotics koumiss (1011 cfu/mL), coliform was not detected in the products, therefore the products met the criteria of The National Agency of Drug and Food Control (NA-DFC) as probiotic functional food. Sensory evaluation was conducted by using hedonic quality test. Based on the hedonic quality test, addition of different concentrations of roselle extract increased the intensity of red color and koumiss viscosity, but had no effect to the aroma and sourness of koumiss. © 2014 Diponegoro University.

A total number of 100 unsexed one-day old Cobb broiler chicks were used and distributed to 5 treatments (control, antibiotics and without BCP, 20 g/kg BCP, 40 g/kg BCP and 60 g/kg BCP) and 4 replications (5 birds for each). Physiological responses of blood and immune organs were measured at 30 day of age. Addition of BCP to broiler ration did not significantly effects on physical properties of blood (leukocytes count, erythrocytes count, haemoglobin, hematocrit, monocytes, and eosinophils) and relative weights of thymus and bursa of fabricius, but significantly (P<0.05) increased relative weights of spleen when compared to control. It was concluded that the black cumin grinds (Nigella sativa) as a feed additive could not change the physical properties of blood, relative weights of thymus and bursa of fabricius, but it increased the relative weight of spleen at the level of 60 g/kg BCP, which could reduce adverse effects of infectious diseases in broiler chicken. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

Eighty four mixed broiler chickens (male:female = 1:1) aged 20 days were distributed to seven treatment groups as follows: 1) Broilers fed 19% protein without SALE (P0); 2) Broilers fed 19% protein plus 4.5 g SALE/kg (P1); 3) Broilers fed 17% protein plus 4,5 g SALE/kg (P2); 4) Broilers fed 15% protein plus 4.5 g SALE/kg (P3); 5) Broilers fed 19% protein plus 9 g SALE/kg (P4); 6) Broilers fed 17% protein plus 9 g SALE/kg (P5); 7) Broilers fed 15% protein plus 9 g SALE/kg (P6). Experimental results showed that supplementation of Sauropus androgynus extract to low protein diets had no effect on meat colour, haemorrhages scale in breast meat, and fatty liver score (P>0.05), but it significantly affected haemorrhages scale in thigh meat (P<0,01), shank colour, meat taste and flavour (P<0.05). In addition, supplementation of the extract significantly affected meat fat content (P<0.05) and meat cholesterol content (P<0.01), but it had no effect on meat protein content (P>0.05). It can be concluded that the leaves extract of Sauropus androgynus supplementation at level of 9 g/kg diets normalized fat deposition in broiler chickens fed low protein diets.

Metabolic hydrogen in the form of reduced protons is used during CH4 formation as well as during VFA synthesis. Therefore, VFA concentration in the rumen may stoichiometrically be related to CH4 emission. The aim of this study was to evaluate methane emission between experimental and model estimates. Two stoichiometrical models for predicting CH4 from VFA were assessed, i.e. Moss et al. (2000) and Hegarty and Nolan (2007) models. The data sets were obtained from a published literature. Samples used were leaves from 27 tropical plant species. Prediction error was conducted by computing root mean square prediction error (RMSPE). Results showed that estimation model of Moss et al. (2000) had lower RMSPE value, i.e. 8.01%, than that of Hegarty and Nolan (2007) model, i.e. 10.73%. Variation of methane emission, i.e. the low or high methane can be estimated by VFA composition with a sufficient accuracy. Adjusment by considering H2 recovery lowered the bias significantly. It can be concluded that Moss model had better accuracy in predicting CH4 emission from VFA composition than that of Hegarty and Nolan model. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

A latin square 4X4 research design was adopted to study the characteristic of AFB1 carry-over rate (COR) of Indonesian crossbred Friesian Holstein (PFH) as effects of inclusions of AFB1-naturally contaminated feed and bentonite in the diet. Results showed a rapid aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) excretion in the milk, detected in the first milking sample or 10 hours after AFB1 ingestion. The steady state of AFM1 concentration observed since the first day of treatment period and AFM1 contamination was still detected until 5 days after AFB1 removed from the diet. The COR in this study was observed 0.1%. AFM1 concentration was highly significantly (P<0.01) affected by treatments. However, there were no significant effects (P>0.05) of levels of AFB1 and bentonite inclusions on the COR, nutrients intake, milk production, and milk composition. IIt is concluded that AFM1 concentration was influenced by AFB1 intake and that transfer of AFB1-feed into AFM1-milk (COR) in PFH cow was lower compare to reported COR value for dairy cow in sub tropical region. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

The study was conducted using survey methods on farmers (fattening and cow-calf operation), who use credit. Sample location was determined using two stage cluster random sampling based on beef cattle population, namely region of Grobogan, Blora, Rembang, Wonogiri and Boyolali. Number of respondents was 50 for fattening and 50 for cow-calf operation. Data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistic, which consisted of scoring, income and multiple linear regression. Results showed that income per-year of beef cattle fattening was greater than cow-calf operation (IDR 8,954,208.00>1,606,786.00), as well as its contribution to the household farmers' income (49.45>14.91%). Credit return ability was 61.35% based on amount of credit IDR 22,482,510. Five-C analysis resulted that character and capacity of farmers were in adequate category, while capital, collateral and condition were IDR 14,932,500.00, IDR 58,740,000.00 and IDR 14,440,600.00.

The experiment used Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with two factors. The first factor was animal age consisted of 3 levels (5, 7 and 9 months). The second factor was concentration of acetic acid solution consisted of 3 levels (2, 4 and 6 percents). The result showed that animal age had significant effect (P<0.01) on the yields, gel strength, viscosity, protein content and pH value but interaction of animal age and concentration of acetic acid had no significant effect (P>0.05) on the yields, gel strength, viscosity, protein content and pH value. It was concluded that pigskin gelatin from ages of 5, 7 and 9 months and acetic acid concentration of 2, 4 and 6% had similar characteristics to the commercial gelatin, but the optimum production of gelatin was combination of pigskin gelatin from 7 months and of 2% acetic acid. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

A number of 24 heads of male thin-tailed sheep were used as experimental material. These sheep were divided into 8 treatment groups. There were two treatment factors, i.e. : PKSO supplementation (S) as factor I and RB supplementation (K) as factor II. Factor I consisted of 2 levels, i.e. 0% (S0) and 10% (S1), whereas factor II consist of 4 levels, i.e. 0% (K0), 15% (K1), 30% (K2) and 45% (K3), respectively, based on dry matter (DM) intake. Several variables were measured, namely content of intra muscular fat (IMF), iodine number of muscular fatty acid, content of meat cholesterol and omega 6 fatty acid (in this case linoleic acid). The collected data were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance with factorial treatment pattern (2 x 4) in completely randomized design (CRD). Content of IMF in sheep supplemented with 0 and 15% KSO levels was not significantly different from those without kapok seed oil (KSO) supplementation at the same level of RB feeding (3.45 and 3.99% vs 3.01 and 3.75%). Supplementation of protected KSO in combination with 30 and 45% RP resulted in significantly increased (P < 0.05) IMF content (4.75 and 5.93% vs 4.32 and 5.40%) and significantly decreased (P < 0.05) meat chollesterol content (62.46 and 65.26 mg/100 g vs 89.21 and 72.63 mg/100 g) also significantly increased (P < 0.05) linoleic acid proportion (15.52 and 18.25% vs 3.68 and 4.04%) and iodine number (12.52 and 10.25 vs 4.09 and 4.98). © 2012 Diponegoro University.

Total of 76 blood samples were collected from Ongole-crossbred cows and bulls (G0), and their progenies (G1) at the Tumaratas AI service center in North Sulawesi province, Indonesia. All blood samples were screened for the presence of GH locus using a PCR-RFLP method involving restricted enzyme Msp1 on 1.2 % of agarose gel. Data were analyzed using statistical program function in Excel XP. The results showed that GH locus using alleles of Msp1+ and Msp1-enzyme restriction in Ongole-crossbred cows and bulls was inherited to their Ongole-crossbred progenies following the Mendelian mode inheritance. This Mendelian inheritance generated by AI technique was not under genetic equilibrium for the Msp1 genotype frequencies in groups of G0 and G1. The breeding program using genotypes of bulls and cows (G0) for generating the genotype of GH Msp1 enzyme restriction by AI technique should be maintained to increase these various allele dispersion rates for breeding under genetic equilibrium of the Ongole-crossbred cattle population. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

Thirty lactating Holstein cows belonging to the 16 farmers at the lowland areas of Yogyakarta Province selling milk directly to the consumers were drawn as the samples. Profitability was determined by enterprise budgeting (accounting profit and economic profit) and break even point. Input and output data were obtained from interview with the farmer samples along with direct observations on the cows performance. The results indicated that under the observed condition of 9.28 liter/day average milk production at IDR 4,700 market price, the accounting profit was found to be IDR 7,758,862/lactating cow/year. The farmers were able to make an economic profit of IDR 1,839,875 with profit margin index of 0.12. If the farmers have to sell the fresh milk to the Cooperatives at the price of IDR 2.800 or IDR 3.200/liter, in order to gain a positive economic profit, milk production must be at least 13.5 or 12.0 liters/day, respectively. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

Survey was conducted on 75 dairy farmers at Getasan District, Semarang Regency. Samples were drawn in random from villages of Jetak, Batur and Tajur, 25 farmers each. The data were analyzed by logit model regression, using 15 indicators of behavioural approach and socio-economic factors as predictors (independent variables) i.e. ages, formal education, family size, experience in cattle rearing, number of cattle raised, production of milk and land occupation. The result showed that 40.04% of the farmers were good, 33.07% were moderate and 20.89% were low risk takers. The farmers' behaviour in enhancing economic of scale significantly influenced by the farmers' age, milk production and number of cattle reared. The odds ratio of ages, milk production and number of cattle reared were 0.93; 1.32 and 1.37, respectively. These values indicated that as values of ages increased as much as 1 year, the values of the willingness on risk taking will decrease as much as 0.93 times; the values of milk production increase as much as 1 litre, the values of the willingness on risk taking will increase as much as 1.32 times; and the values of the number of cattle increased as much as 1 AU, the values of the willingness on risk taking will increase as much as 1.37 times. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

Lymphocyte T would directly react to antigen presented to the cell surface by antigen presenting cell (APC). Th-CD4 interaction functioned to maintain Th-APC bond intact during specific antigen activation. Fatty acid in virgin coconut oil (VCO) was potential as immunostimulant, which therefore could increase chicken immunity through the increase of lymphocyte T and Th-CD4. This research used 40 one-day-old broiler chickens. The method applied was Completely Randomized Factorial Design in which the first factor was two levels of vaccine, namely groups of AI vaccinated and unvaccinated. The second factor was four levels of VCO namely 0, 5, 10, 15 mL/kg feed. Day Old Chick (DOC) were divided into eight treatment groups and repeated five times. Feed and water were given ad libitum for four weeks. The result showed that the number of lymphocyte and Th-CD4 in chickens given 10 mL per kg feed and vaccinated with AI was higher than that in chickens given VCO without AI vaccine. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

Effectivity of treatments was assessed by addition of inoculants (control, Lp, Lp+Sc) and level of rice bran (0, 5 and 10%) which were arranged on Completely Randomized Design with Teatments Factors (3x3). The variables measured were total colonies of microbes (lactic acid bacteria, yeast and clostridia), total gas production, volatile fatty acids (VFA) and ammonia (NH3). Results showed that clostridial colonies counted on silage treated by Lp and Lp+Sc around 37.5% and 68.7% in which lower than control. Addition of inoculants and rice bran increased fermentability of silage significantly (P<0.05), however treatment had no affected (P>0.05) on production of VFA and NH3. Gas production from silage fermentable fraction with inoculation of Lp (49.5 ml) and Lp+Sc (47.9 ml) higher than untreated silage (46.6 ml). It was concluded that the use of inoculants consortium consisted of L. plantarum and S. cerevisiae with rice bran addition improved fermentability and reduced clostridial colony in king grass silage. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

Twelve heads of male JTT sheep were devided into 3 groups, consisted of 4 heads as replication, respectively. There were three kinds of ration as treatments, namely: fresh FG (T0), pelleted FG (T1), and combination between 85% FG and 15% rice bran (T2). The measured variables were: feed dry matter (DM) consumption, in vivo dry matter digestibility (IVoDMD) and in vivo organic mattter digestibility (IvoOMD), molar proportion of partial volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and daily body weight gain (DBWG). Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) in completely randomized design (CRD). Result of this investigation showed hat feed consumption by sheep received pelleted FG was higher (P< 0.05) than those received FG (513 vs 393 g). Ratio of acetic acid : propionic acid in sheep received pelleted FG was lower (P<0.05) than those in sheep received FG (2.53 vs 3.46). Feeding of the pelleted FG resulted in DBWG significantly differed from combination between FG and rice bran (69 and 72 g), and were higher (P<0.05) than feeding of FG (53 g). In conclusion, the feeding of pelleted FG resulted the higher DM consumption and ruminal propionic acid, the lower acetic acid : propionic acid ratio, than feeding of fresh FG. Feeding of pelleted FG to male JTT sheep increased the DBWG, equivalent to those by feeding of combination between 85% fresh FG an 15% rice bran. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

Participatory situation analysis was employed to gain data relating to pig profiles in the urban and rural areas of Manokwari. Due to the interests of combining many correlated data, multivariate analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed. Cluster Analysis using Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering was applied for analysis of merge samples based on similarity in components' composition across sites. There were various twelve classes of pig profiles in Manokwari. In principal component of the first axis correlation of several components shows strong positive relation e.g. in piglets, sows, and total herd size. Status of region in the first axis of PCA (P1) through which pigs were raised had negative correlation, including grower, household member and pig production. In the second axis (P2), negative correlations were shown in piglets, grower, boars, total herd size and the Pig Production Potential (PPP). Status of region has underpinned profiles of pigs. Several farmers were able to manage their farm continuity in a steady composition. Selling pigs was the main aim and few farmers play a role as pure breeder. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

The cultivars tested were Taiwan (Gt), King (Gk) and Mott (Gm) and arranged in a 3 x 2 of treatments with four replicates following nested design. The results showed that the highest sugar content (P<0.01) was found in Gt cultivar and the lowest was in Gm cultivar. The highest starch content (P<0.01) was found in Gk cultivar and the lowest was in Gt cultivar. TNC content of Gt and Gk cultivars were not significantly different, but both were significantly higher (P<0.01) compared with the Gm cultivar. It can be concluded, that there were differences in TNC between cultivars, however, the TNC content in Gk cultivar was not different with Gt cultivar, while Gm cultivar have the lowest (P<0.01) TNC content. At reproductive phase all cultivars have higher (P<0.01) TNC and starch content than at vegetative phase. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

Four lactating (4 ± 1.5 months ) Fries Holland (FH) cows were allocated into four treatments of concentrate containing 4.5% palm oil (CP0), 4.5% corn oil (CP1), 4.5% roasted ground corn (CP2), and 1.5% corn oil and 3% roasted ground corn (CP3), respectively, in 4 x 4 Latin Square experimental design with 3 d-period. Results showed that there were no significant (P>0.05) effects on milk yield, milk fat and protein, and milk fatty acid. However, the highest average of milk production was found in CP2 (8.63 kg/d). Milk fat was decreasing to 3.81% in conjunction with the more potential total PUFA (71.81%) in CP3 with corn oil and roasted ground corn. Ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 in milk was the same in both, CP2 and CP3, it was 2.14. However , since the objective of this research was to improve milk yield as well as milk components and health concern, therefore the CP2 with roasted ground corn was considered as the optimal one. © 2010 De Gruyter Open Ltd.

A total of six treatments were investigated in the present study, which consisted of: maize silage (A), M. oleifera (B), P. peltatum (C), maize silage + concentrate (56:44, w/w; D), maize silage + M. oleifera (56:44, w/w; E), and maize silage + concentrate + P. peltatum (47:37:16, w/w/w; F). The feeds were incubated in vitro in three replicates (completely randomized) using the Reading Pressure Technique system. Approximately 800 mg of the feeds were mixed by 75 ml of buffered rumen liquor. The incubation was carried out up to 12 h in bottles and gas pressure was recorded and released in regular intervals. Repeated sampling was conducted for analysis of fermentation products at 1, 6 and 12 h of incubation period. The results showed that the nutritional quality of Moringa and its fermentation pattern was comparable to that of barley-soya concentrate. Plain Moringa incubation resulted the highest production of iso-SCFA and soluble protein concentration among all treatments after 12 h incubation (P&lt;0.05). Incubation of sole Peltiphyllum peltatum highly hampered the fermentation rate. Production of iso-SCFA both for plain Peltiphyllum and its mixture were comparatively low. Supplementation of Peltiphyllum increased significantly soluble protein concentration during 12 h incubation (P&lt;0.05). Peltiphyllum also had a very low C2+C4/C3 ratio compared to other treatments. It could be concluded that Moringa oleifera is a potential alternative supplement to replace either partially or completely concentrate as a conventional supplement, and Peltiphyllum peltatum supplementation could reduce excessive protein degradation and fermentation of the concentrate in the rumen. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

This inhibition is called by LPO system (LPOS). Our laboratory scale study in previous experiment showed that whey immobilized on SP-Sepharose Fast Flow (SP-FF) could produce OSCN- continuously. Then, the purpose of this study is to scale up continuous production of OSCN- using immobilized whey. Immobilized whey was generated by circulating various amounts of whey through SP-FF. To generate OSCN-, 10 ml of the substrate solution containing 0.5 mM SCN- and 0.5 mM H2O2, was circulated through immobilized whey and followed by washing with pure water. The next cycle was done by circulating a fresh 10 ml of substrate solution at the same concentration. The result indicated that a stable immobilization efficiency of more than 90% was achieved in the SP-FF circulated with 300 ml or less of whey per gram of SP-FF. When stored at 4°C, immobilized whey retained 80% LPO activity until 3 weeks storage. The reaction solution discharged from immobilized whey was observed to contain approximately 0.4 mM OSCN-. The experiment using 1.0 g of immobilized whey produced a stable 0.4 mM OSCN- production and antimicrobial activity for at least 6 cycles. The increase in resin volume accompanied by the increase in whey volume resulted the extension of a stable OSCN- production. The experiment using recycled SP-FF did not affect to the stability of OSCN- production and antimicrobial activity. These results may open the way for the large-scale production of OSCN-. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

Thirty-two ISA Brown hens were individually caged and offered four diets (wheat-based, millrun-based, barley-based, and barley-enzymes diets) for 10 weeks. The present experiment was assigned in a completely randomized design with 8 replicates per dietary treatment. Wheat- and barley diets caused significantly higher (P<0.05) viscosity than other diets. Increased viscosity caused lower digesta dry matter (DM) (P<0.01) and higher excreta moisture (P<0.05). The wheat diet did not cause a negative effect on intestinal starch digestibility, feed intake, and bird performance (P>0.05). Birds fed the barley-based diet had lower weight gain (P<0.05) and higher caecal weight (P<0.05) than those given other diets. Enzyme supplementation on barley diets significantly (P<0.05) reduced jejunal digesta viscosity and caecal weight, increased weight gain (P<0.05) and ileal digesta DM (P<0.01), and numerically reduced excreta moisture. The current study demonstrated that NSP have a profound effect on digesta viscosity, performance, and digestive organs of birds; however, the NSP action may be modified by an interaction with each other and with other cellwall components of grains in the gut. Enzyme supplementation reduced the negative effect of digesta viscosity. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

Characterization was by using 174 buffalos from any group of ages and sex that were collected from West area (Werwaru, Patti), Central area (Syota, Klis) and East area (Tounwawan, Poliwu). The variables observed were morphometric characters (body weight, shoulder height, body length, chest width, chest depth, chest girth, skull length, skull width, skull height, ear width, ear length, cannon girth, horn length, horn girth and distance between horns), body morphology characters (horn position, head color, body color and scheme of body color), and genetic distance between buffalo subpopulations. Body morphometric data were analyzed using mean, standard deviation and variance coefficient. Body morphology data were analyzed using relative frequencies. The genetic distance was analyzed using canonical discriminant function through Mahalanobis distance approach and by making phylogeny using UPGMA method. The result indicated that variation of body morphometric was related to production performance, variation of color and color scheme of body.

One hundred and twenty five dayold broiler chicks of CP 707 strains were divided into five groups for five treatments. A Completely Randomized Design was used in this experiment. The treatments were 0 (control), 2, 4, 6 and 8% fish fermented by LAB substitution of basal diet containing 8% fish meal. The parameters were blood lipid profile including total cholesterol, Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) and High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides. Data was analyzed by one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). When the F test indicated a significant effect, the differences between the mean values were analyzed by Duncan's Multiple Range test. Results showed that using fish silage fermented by LAB on broiler's feed did not affect total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, but significantly affect (p<0.05) levels of LDL cholesterol and serum triglycerides of broilers. Based on serum lipid profile, it could be concluded that fish fermented by LAB can be used as a substitute for the 100% fish meal in broiler's feed. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

They were caged individually and fed diet containing 0 (control), 1, 2, and 4% oven dried garlic powder for 4 periods of 4 weeks. The old hens consumed more food compared to those of the young one, while water consumption was in the reverse condition. The egg production indicated by the young hens fed dietary 1 and 2% garlic powder was significantly higher than those fed control diet. However, the old hens produced heavier eggs than those of the young hens, particularly when 1% garlic powder was supplemented. There was a closed relationship between serum and egg cholesterol, which reduced gradually with longer time the hens fed dietary garlic. The results clearly demonstrated that the laying hens fed dietary garlic powder up to 4% produced egg containing lower cholesterol (-34%) compared to those fed control diet; The hypocholesterolemic effect of garlic powder is apparently higher in the old hen compared to that in the young hen. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

Materials used in this experiment were records relating to milk yield and pedigree. The obtained data were categorized into 2 groups i.e. Age Group I (AG I) that was cow calving at < 36 months old as many as 33 cows with 33 lactation records and AG II that cows calving e” 36 months old as many as 44 cows with 105 lactation records. The first three to seven months data were used to estimate actual milk yield. Results showed that mean of milk yield/ head/ lactation at AG I (2479.5 ± 461.5 kg) was lower than that of AG II (2989,7 ± 526,8 kg). Estimated milk yields for three to seven months at AG I were 2455.6±419.7; 2455.7±432.9; 2455.5±446.4; 2455.6±450.8; 2455,64 ± 450,8; 2455,5 ± 459,3 kg respectively, meanwhile at AG II was 2972.3±479.8; 2972.0±497.2; 2972.4±509.6; 2972.5±523.6 and 2972.5±535.1 respectively. Correlation coefficients between estimated and actual milk yield at AG I were 0.79; 0.82; 0.86; 0.86 and 0.88, respectively, meanwhile at AG II were 0.65; 0.66; 0.67; 0.69 and 0.72 respectively. In conclusion, the mean of estimated milk yield at AG I was lower than AG II.

This study involved 69 grass-fed steers with a live-weight range of 300 to 600 kg. They had entered, or were progressing along, their fat deposition phase. An allometric model (Huxley, 1932) was used to study the growth patterns of carcass tissues within wholesale cuts. In general, The growths of muscle and fat within wholesale cuts followed similar patterns. Some differences in growth patterns between muscle and fat were identified on the dorsal region. The growth impetus for fat moved from the thoracic backwards to the lumbar region which was the reverse of the growth impetus for muscle. Differential growth patterns occurred between intermuscular (IM) fat and subcutaneous (SC) fat. With IM fat, its growth movement was similar to that of total fat where there was a concentration of growth in the lumbar area and thin flank as side weight increased. With SC fat, there were growth movements from the ventral region to the dorsal region of the carcass. Bone growth within wholesale cuts showed a less clear pattern. © 2009 Journal of the Indonesian Tropical Animal Agriculture.

The cattle used were 18 heads aged 2 to 2.5 years with initial body weight of 229.86±12.46 kg. The cattle were randomly divided into three treatment groups. The T0 group was given feed the same as traditional fattening cattle practices by farmers, T1 group fed ration containing 12% crude protein (CP) and 72% total digestible nutrients (TDN), and T2 group fed ration containing 15% CP and 72% TDN. Cattle were fed individually for 90 days and drinking water ad libitum. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance. Results of research indicated the nitrogen balance, and blood urea nitrogen between T1 and T2 were relatively similar, but those were higher (P&lt;0.05) than T0 . In contrast, microbial proteins synthesis, and blood glucose at 0, 4, and 6 hours before and after feeding were relatively similar between the groups. Blood glucose of T2 at 2 hours after intake were higher (P &lt;0.05) than T0, but was not different with T1 . It can be concluded, that the fattening male Bali cattle fed ration containing 12% CP and 72% TDN improved the nitrogen balance and blood metabolites, but it was no positive effect on the microbial proteins and N synthesis. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

Identification of gene polymorphisms was important to get early information to determine genetic markers associated with economically desirable traits. Genetic mapping is one of important characterizations in the selection process. Pesisir cattle is one of local cattle in Indonesia that are reared in West Sumatera and have become adaptive to local environment. The present study aimed to identify the genotype of Growth Hormone gene (GH891MspI) of the Pesisir cattle and crossbred Simmental-Pesisir cattle (designated as SimPes) and relationship between growth performance (body weight and body size). The present study was conducted to 30 blood samples consisted of 15 Pesisir cattle and 15 SimPes cattle. Body weight and body size were measured at 12-18 months of age. The Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was used in this research. The results showed that there exist three variant genotypes (MspI-/-, MspI+/-, MspI+/+) and that allele frequencies of MspI-And MspI+ were 53.3% and 46.7%, respectively. Non-significant effect has found between GH's genotype and growth traits (Body measurement and body weight) in both of breed cattle. In conclusion, three variant genotypes (GH891MspI) in Pesisir and SimPes (Simmental x Pesisir) cattle population were found and no significant effect on growth trait performance. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

The data used in this research was weight recordings of (768) PO cattle, ranging from calf (&lt; 1 month) to adult (60 months), collected by Kebumen PO cattle Breeder Association (ASPOKEB) from 2013 to 2015. These cattle were reared by a group of farmers located in six sub-districts: Mirit, Lembu Purwo, Ambal, Puring, Petanahan, and Klirong in Kebumen district, Jawa Tengah Province. Brody, Bertalanfy, Logistic and Gompertz mathematical models were used to analyze the data. The analysis showed that the R2 of the four models classify high in the category (R2 &gt;0.70). Mature weight (A) of PO cattle predicted by Logistic (349 kg) and Gompertz (358 kg) were most appropriate.

Broiler chicks at 11 days of age were allotted to five groups, including T0 (birds drinking 100% water), T1 (25% decocted turmeric + 75% water), T2 (50% decocted turmeric + 50% water), T3 (75% decocted turmeric + 25% water) and T4 (100% decocted turmeric). The study was arranged based on a completely randomized design (CRD), parameters investigated was performance and blood chemistry (leukocyte, total protein, albumin, globulin, uric acid, glucose). The data were subjected to analysis of variance at 5% probability. Decocted turmeric did not affect weight gain, feed and water consumption and feed conversion ratio of broilers. Lymphocytes proportion was higher (P<0.05) in T1, T2 and T4 than in T0 and T3 birds. The heterophils to lymphocytes ratio was lower (P<0.05) in birds receiving decocted turmeric than control. Globulin concentration and albumin to globulin ratio were higher and lower (P<0.05), respectively, in serum of T2, T3 and T4 than T0 and T1 birds. The proportion of heterophils and concentration of serum total protein, albumin, uric acid and glucose were not different among treatments. The weight of breast meat was higher and lower (P<0.05) in T3 and T4 birds, respectively, compared to the control. In conclusion, providing decocted turmeric through drinking water helped to improve stress responses and increased the weight of breast meat of broiler chickens.","Blood count; Broiler chick; Carcass; Decocted turmeric; Serum biochemistry",,,,,,,,"Al Sultan, S.I., The effect of Curcuma longa (turmeric) on overall performances of broiler chicken (2003) Int.

The objective of this study was to confirm genetic polymorphism of TG5 gene in Bali cattle populations from three different regions as the main resources of Bali cattle in Indonesia. A total of 200 head of Bali cattle have been performed genotyping on TG5 gene using polymerase chain reactionrestriction fragment lenght polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method and sequence analysis. Results of the study confirmed that TG5 was monomorphic in Bali cattle wherever their origin regions. Moreover, nine candidate SNPs were detected within 5’UTR of TG gene in Bali cattle compared to Genbank reference sequences, although no SNP variations among Bali cattle sample studied. The new other genetic markers within an entire TG gene suggested to be explored and verified for their polymorphisms in Bali cattle. The nine candidate SNPs were also required further verification and validation in a larger sample to be regarded as new SNPs between Bali cattle and Genbank reference sequences.","5’-untranslated region; Bali cattle; Genetic polymorphism; Marbling; Thyroglobulin gene",,,,,,"Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia","This research was supported by Enrekang Technopark Program, funded by Center for Plant Conservation-Botanic Gardens, Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI).

This research was carried out from August to December 2015 in Urut Sewu area, Kebumen. The calculation of genetic parameter estimation was heritability of weaning weight. The value of heritability was used to calculate the breeding value of sires based on offsprings weaning weight. Heritability was calculated using paternal half-sib correlation with the direct pattern variance analysis. Breeding Value (BV) of sire was calculated by absolute estimated breeding value. The materials used in this study included were data record during the last three years (2013-2015) consisted of 41 sires, 51 dams and 244 calves. Weaning weight data had been corrected based on age of dams, sex and weaning age of 120 days. The results showed that the heritability value of weaning weight was included in high category (0.36 ± 0.21). The highest BV was KJ.J608 (49.76) with a ratio of 231.45%.

Two hundred Muscovy day-old ducks consisting of white-plumed male and female duck, black and white-plumed male and female ducks. Body weight was recorded weekly and the obtained data were subject to T test. Primer design used the Custal X Program based on a database from the GeneBank Cairina moschata GH gene, partial cds (AB158762). Primer base sequence of GH gene was forward/Sequence: 5’-CTGGGGTTGTTTAGCTTGGA-3’ and reverse/Sequence: 5’-TAAACCTTCCCTGGCACAAC-3’. The DNA sequences were aligned by using the BioEdit version 7.7 for identification of the single nucleotide polymorphism. The result showed that male Muscovy duck produced higher an average body weight gain and more relative growth than those of females. The highest body weight gain was at three weeks old, and then it started to decrease at four weeks old. The sequencing PCR product obtained nucleotide polymorphism. AA genotype was observed at 136 t of black female Muscovy duck, CC in black and white male Muscovy duck, and white female Muscovy duck. Conclusively, a body weight gain of 3-week-old male Muscovy ducks was higher than that of females and GH gene polymorphism was observed in Muscovy ducks.","Growth hormone polymorphism; Muscovy duck; Sexual dimorphism",,,,,,,,"Badyaev, A.V., Growing apart: An ontogenetic perspective on the evolution of sexual size dimorphism (2002) Trends in Ecol.

The study was conducted using a completely randomized factorial design, consisting of 2 factors with 5 replications. The materials used were the newly dead chickens which were chopped and mixed thoroughly with all ingredients; then transferred into a 5 liters plastic box for fermentation. Observations were made after 3 weeks fermentation, including: a) physical characteristics, b) microbial contents, and c) nutritional contents. The data were calculated using variance analysis utilizing computer program of SPSS version 21.0. It was found that based on the protein contents the Lactobacillus sp. (19.0%) was better than the Streptomyces sp. (17.8%) if combined with molasses and corn meal as the accelerators. However, the fat contents produced were relatively similar for both of the inoculums (mean of 37.8%). It can be concluded that in order to obtain a best fermented product in terms of the protein and fat content, the dead chicken should be fermented using molasses and cornmeal as the accelerator and Lactobacillus sp. as the inoculum.","Accelerator; Dead chickens; Fermentation; Inoculum; Silage flour",,,,,,,,"Aberle, E.D., Forest, C.J., Hedrick, H.B., Judge, M.D., Merkel, R.A., (2001) The Principle of Meat Science, , W.H.

A completely randomized design was used with various concentrations of HCl treatment 0.3M, 0.6M, 0.9 M, 1.2 M and 1.5M, and four times replication, followed by least significant difference test. The HCl concentration gave significantly effect (P<0.05) on yield, viscosity, pH, gel strength and redness of gelatin. The highest yield (29.17%) was obtained at a concentration of HCl 0.9M. The highest gel strength and viscosity at concentration of 1.2M, were 293.41g bloom and 22.17 cp, respectively. The pH of the gelatin were 5.08 to 5.52. The lightness level (L∗) was 69.92-70.97, whereas the redness r an ged (a∗) from 0.55 to 1.54 and the yellowness ranged (b∗) from 17.54 to 19.59. The moisture, protein and ash concentrations of gelatin were 7.05±0.07- 8.92±0.06%, protein content of 83.38±0.06 -91.11±0.03%, and the ash content 0.53 ± 0.04 to 1.23 ± 0.09%, respectively. Based on the spectra absorption of infrared were detected four areas amides: Amide A (3402.43-3448.72 cm-1), amide I (1635.65 cm-1), amide II (1527.62 cm-1) and amide III (1242.16 cm-1). The differences in the concentration of HCl had impact on yield, characteristics and secondary structure of buffalo hide gelatin. The HCl concentration at 0.9M was the optimum condition to obtain the highest yield. The characteristics of buffalo hide gelatin after pretreatment using hydrochloric acid had met the standards of GMIA (2012).","Buffalo hide; Gelatin; Hydrochloric acid; Pretreatment; Yield",,,,,,,,"Lee, J.W., Choi, S.B., Jung, Y.H., Keown, J.F., Van Vleck, L.D., Parameter estimates for direct and maternal genetic effects on yearling, eighteen-month, and slaughter weights of Korean native cattle (2000) J.

This enzyme affects the fats in intramuscular so having influence on marbling. The purpose of this study was to obtain the polymorphisms of the SCD gene and their associations with meat quality traits in Bali cattle. The number of samples used were 48 heads of cattle consisted of 24 bulls and 24 cows from BPTU-HMT Bali cattle in the province of Bali. The SCD gene has been amplified using forward primer 5'-ACC CCT TGG TGT GTG GTT GTT CTT C-3 'and reverses primer 5'-CCT GAC GAT ACT ATG TTT CTA CTT C-3'. The polymorphisms of the SCD gene were identified by direct sequencing method. Meat quality traits such as thick of longissimus dorsi (TLD), thick of back fat (TBF), thick of fat rump (TFR), thick of rump (TR), marbling score (MS), and the percentage of intramuscular fat (PIMF) were analyzed using the Veterinary Ultrasound Scanner. To determine Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium status, both allele and genotype frequencies were analyzed using GENEPOP program (V3.2). Association of the SCD gene SNP and meat quality traits was analyzed by GLM. This result showed that there were 5 monomorphic SNPs (c.10153A>G, c.10318C>A, c.10329C>T, g.10394G>A, g.10486A>C) and 3 polymorphic SNPs (g.10360G>A, g.10428C>T, g. 10487G>A) were in HW equilibrium. Association analysis showed that g.10428C>T SNP significantly affected marbling score (MS) and percentage of intramuscular fat (PIMF) (P<0.05). Based on these results, g.10428C>T SNP of the SCD gene may be used as a candidate marker to select meat quality traits in Bali cattle.","Bali cattle; SCD gene; SNP",,,,,,,,"Azrai, M., Pemanfaatan markah molekuler dalam proses seleksi pemuliaan tanaman (2005) J.

The aims of this study were to identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in exon 5 and 6 of CAPN1 gene and its associate with carcass and meat characteristic traits in bali cattle. A total of 48 bali cattles from BPTU-HMT Bali Cattle, Bali Province were used in the research. SNP in exon 5 and 6 of CAPN1 gene were identify with direct sequencing using MEGA 5 program. Analysis of polymorphism was conducted by PopGen 1.32 software to identify frequencies of genotype, allele and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The association of CAPN1 gene genotype with carcass and meat characteristic traits was analyzed using Generalized Linear Model (GLM) procedure of SAS. Sequencing analysis at exon 5-6 of CAPN1 gene in Bali cattle resulted in eight polymorphic SNPs. They are c.3669T>C, c.3854G>A, c.3881T>C, c.3899C>T, c.3908C>G, c.4002C>A, c.4021G>T and c.4037A>C. The SNPs c.3669T>C, c.3854G>A and c.3899C>T were significantly (P<0.05) associated with rump thickness (RT), rump fat thickness (RFT) and marbling score (MS), while SNP c.4037A>C was not significantly associated with carcass and meat characteristic traits. The SNPs were significantly associated with carcass and meat characteristic traits namely c.3669T>C, c.3854G>A and c.3899C>T. Those SNPs may be used as candidate marker for Marker Assisted Selection (MAS) in bali cattle.","Bali cattle; CAPN1 gene; SNP",,,,,,,,"Allendrof, F.W., Luikart, G., Aitken, S.N., (2013) Conservation and the Genetics of Populations, , 2nd Ed.

Plant material of 30 cm length with diameter of 2-3 cm were planted in the poly-bag of 15 x 25 cm size. The area were fertilized using Triple Super Phosphate (TSP) and Kalium Cloride (KCl) fertilizer at 75 kg/ha during land plough and using N fertilizer (Urea) at 100 kg/ha applied at two months age of plant. Treatment of population density of Gliricidia sepium (Jacq) Steud at 20, 30 and 40 plants per area of 9 m2 combined with cutting interval of 3; 6; 9 and 12 weeks were conducted in this study. Treatments were set in factorial arrangement based on block randomized design. Variables measured were including quality of leaf, dried matter production rate and vegetative growth. Results showed that nutrient content of the leaf of Gliricidia sepium (Jacq) Steud dictated by cutting interval, and vegetative performance influenced by the interaction of population density and cutting interval. In conclusion, to sustain high dry matter leaf production and quality of Gliricidia sepium (Jacq) Steud underneath coconut plantation management should be focused on the planting and defoliation regimes.","Coconut; Cutting; Density; Gliricidia; Quality",,,,,,,,"Ella, A., Jacobsen, C., Stur, W.W., Blair, G.J., Effect of plant density and cuttingfrequency on the productivity of four tree legumes (1989) Tropical Grassland., 23, pp. 28-34; Edwards, A., Mlambo, V., Lallo, C.H.O., Garcia, G.W., Yield, chemical composition andIn-vitro ruminal fermentation of leaves of L.

The incubation temperature was room temperature (RT) and temperature of 40.6oC (40.6) for 2 hours. These incubation temperatures for creating dendeng sapi were designed to provide the similar curing characteristics of the control (by addition of 50 ppm of NaNO2). Four naturally cured dendeng sapi treatments were A1 = 22 g FCL/kg of beef, RT; A2 = 36 g FCL/kg of beef, RT; A3 = 22 g FCL/kg of beef, 40.6; A4 = 36 g FCL/kg of beef, 40.6 and a treatment of conventionally cured dendeng sapi by addition of 50 ppm NaNO2 as a control (A0 ). All of the naturally cured dendeng sapi (A1-A4) showed color, cured pigment, total pigment and residual nitrite which were not significantly different compared with A0 . The FCL used in this study was an effective replacement for sodium nitrite at the test levels in manufacturing natural cured dendeng sapi. These results indicated that at fewer FCL levels (22 g/kg of beef) and a more practical of the incubation for 2 hours at room temperature were more effective to create naturally cured dendeng sapi.","Cured pigment; Dendeng sapi; Fresh celery leaves; Natural curing; Residual nitrite",,,,,,,,"Nitrites in cured meat (1990) Official Methods of Analysis, 31, p. 973. , Association of Official Analytical Chemists (A.

The total 60 blood samples of Bali Cattle derived from BPTU Bali in Bali siland (20 heads), BPTU Serading in Sumbawa island (20 heads) and Village Breeding Center in Barru District South Sulawesi (20 heads) were used to evaluate their genetic diversity at exon 5 UTMP gene. The forward and reverse data sequences were analyzed using Bioedit program and alignment analysis was carried out using MEGA5 program. Meanwhile haplotype analysis was performed by DnaSPv5 program. The result showed that partial sequences in exon 5 UTMP gene had 16 haplotypes with the highest number of haplotypes ware found in VBC Barru district South Sulawesi (8 haplotypes). Moreover, the highest average of haplotype (h) and nucleotide (p) diversity were found in VBC Barru district South Sulawesi were 0.7949 and 0.0016, respectively. In addition, minisatellite insersion was found in exon 5 UTMP gene fragment on Bali cattle which are consist of 5'-CCA GTC ATG AAG AAG GCA GAG GTC GTC GTG CCG GCG AAA-3'. According to our results, haplotype and minisatellite variation in exon 5 UTMP gene fragment can be used as a candidate genetic marker specific for reproductive trait in the Bali cattle and for its strategy breeding program in the future.","Bali cattle; Diversity; Haplotype; UTMP gene",,,,,,,,"Entwistle, K., Lindsay, D.R., (2003) Strategies to Improve Bali Cattle in Eastern Indonesia, P100, pp. 1-2. , Proceedings, Bali Indonesia Feb. 4-7, 2002; Goodall-Copestake, W.P., Tarling, G.A., Murphy, E.J., On the comparison of population-level estimates ofhaplotype and nucleotide diversity: A case study usingthe gene cox1 in animals (2012) Heredity., 109, pp. 50-56; Hall, T.A., BioEdit: A user-friendly biological sequence alignment editor and analysis program for Windows 95/98/NT (1999) Nucl.

The first experiment was aimed to create three TMR with different synchronization index. Ingredient feedstuffs of TMR were evaluated for its in situ organic matter (OM) and nitrogen (N) degradation kinetics. On the basis of the OM and N degradation kinetics of feedstuffs, three sugarcane bagasse based TMR were formulated with synchronization indexes of 0.37; 0.50; and 0.63; respectively. The TMR had similar levels of crude protein (CP), total digestible nutrients, and neutral detergent fiber (NDF). In the second experiment, the three TMR with different synchronization index were evaluated for in situ degradability characteristics of OM, CP, NDF, and sulfur. The in situ degradation of OM in TMR were decreased (P<0.05) with the increasing of synchronization index. The higher synchronization index in TMR increased (P<0.05) CP degradation of CP. The NDF degradation decreased slightly by the alteration of synchronization index in TMR. The higher synchronization index in TMR reduced (P<0.05) in situ sulfur degradation, and this may not support to effects of synchronization of carbohydrate and nitrogen supply.","In situ; Nutrient degradation; Sugarcane bagasse; Synchronization",,,,,,,,"Al-Dobeeb, S.N., Evaluation of digestibility, nitrogen and sulfur balances and rumen fermentation of diets supplemented with urea and/or potassium sulfate in Naeimi sheep (2004) Pak.

Experiment was arranged to a completely randomized design with four treatments and three replications. Four treatments as follows (A) king grass without LAB inoculant as the control; (B) king grass + 30 ml of liquid of epiphytic LAB inoculant/kg of fresh forage; (C) king grass + 30 g of freeze-dried powder of LAB inoculant/kg of fresh forage; (D) king grass + 30 g of centrifuged powder of LAB inoculant/kg of fresh forage. The liquid LAB inoculant was sprayed on the top of grass and then mannualy mixed by hand. The intial LAB concentration in all inoculants were 1.0 × 106 cfu/g. About 500 g of silage materials were ensiled into plastic silos and stored at room temperatures (approximately 28oC) for 30 days. Results showed that pH value, concentrations of lactic acid, N-amonia (NH3-N), butyric acid and total volatile fatty acids (VFA) as well as Fleigh Point were affected by treatment of LAB inoculant. Silage treated with liquid or dried of LAB inoculant had lower (P<0.01) pH value compared to the control silage. Concentrations of NH3-N and butyric acid significantly decreased (P<0.01) in silage treated with LAB inoculants. Silage treated with centrifuged powder of LAB inoculant had the highest (P<0.05) Fleigh Point than other silage. In vitro neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility was significantly higher (P<0.05) in silage treated with LAB inoculant compared to the control silage. © 2015 Diponegoro University.

A hundred and eighty 3-weeks-old broiler chicks were used in this present experiment based on factorial design (3×4). The birds were randomly allocated into three experimental diets containing of 5, 10 and 15% of banana leaves fermented within 0, 5, 10 and 15 days. Each treatment was divided into three replicates of five chicks in each. The experiment was terminated after 4 weeks or when the birds were 7-weeks-old. Feed intake, body weight gain, feed efficiency and carcass yield were measured during the study. The data were subjected to the analysis of variance test followed by least significant difference (LSD) test. Results showed that daily feed intake was significantly affected (P?0.01) by the dietary treatments, in which feed intake was highest in broilers fed diet containing 10% banana leaves fermented for 10 days. The daily weight gain, feed efficiency and carcass yield were significantly affected (P?0.01) by the treatments, in which the highest values of daily weight gain, feed efficiency, and carcass yield were observed in birds fed diet containing 10% banana leaves fermented for 10 days. It can be concluded that diet containing 10% banana leaves fermented for 10 days can be included in broiler ration without detrimental effects on the performance and carcass yield. © 2015 Diponegoro University.

The study was consisted of two steps of experiment. The first step of experiment used two rumen cannulated adult rams to create formulation of three diets with different synchronization index, namely 0.37; 0.50 and 0.63 respectively. The experimental diets were designed to be iso-energy, iso-nitrogenous and iso-neutral detergent fibre (iso-NDF). The second step of experiment was to determine the body composition of sheep fed the experimental diets, which were created in the first experiment. The body composition of fifteen rams were determined on week 0; 4; and 8 of experimental period, these were accomplished using the technique of urea dilution. The alteration of synchronization index did not affect on feed intake, ratio of ruminal acetate to propionate and serum glucose concentration, but dry matter (DM) digestibility was affected (P<0.05) by the treatment of synchronization index in the diet. The alteration of synchronization index in the diet did not affect on the percentage of body protein, fat and water significantly, though body weight of sheep gained slightly during the experimental period. © 2015 Diponegoro University.

Sixty 1-d-old Ross chicks were divided to two experimental groups, i.e., birds provided access to feed and water ad libitum immediately post-hatch until d 35 and birds deprived from feed but not from water over the first 48 h post-hatch. Blood for cholesterol analysis was collected on d 34. The same birds were sacrificed on d 36, and immediately breast meat, abdominal fat, heart and liver were collected and weighed. Feed deprivation over the first 48 h post-hatch retarded (P<0.05) growth performance of chickens, but had no impact (P>0.05) on the abdominal fat, fatty acid profile of meat, total serum cholesterol level as well as the weight of heart and liver of broiler.

Twelve ram average body weight 20.65 + 1.89 kg, CV = 9.15%, and age ranged from 12 to 18 months were used in this study. Rams were daily fed pelleted diet at 5% of body weight (BW) in 100% dry matter base. Animals were assigned to Completely Randomized Design and divided into three groups for different feeding time treatments. The treatments were day feeding time (feeding allowed from 0600 to 1800; T0618), night feeding (from 1800 to 0600; T1806) and whole-day feeding (24 h; T0606), respectively. Parameters observed in this study were duration of eating, rumination, rest, standing and laying activity (minute/day), dry matter intake (DMI, g/day) and eating speed (g/minute). Collected data were analyzed using ANOVA with F-test and if significantly was found were then analyzed with Duncan test. The results showed that eating duration (89.71 min/day) and DMI (1034.53 g/day) on T1806 were significantly lower (P<0.05) than T0618 (117.78 min/day; 1208.75 g/day) and T0606 (127.5 min/day; 1281.63 g/day) but, the other observation of ruminating, rest, standing and laying duration and eating speed were found not significantly different in the all treatments. It can be concluded that feeding at night period can reduce eating time significantly compared to feeding during the day period or 24 hours a day, although it results in decreasing feed consumption. © 2015 Diponegoro University.

A completely randomized design, factorial pattern 3 x 3 was used in this study. The first factor was storage temperature (-1 to -5; 1 to 5 and 6 to 10oC) and the second factor was storage time (10; 20 and 30 days). Each treatment has three replicates. Variables observed included pH, water activity (aw), total lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and total yeast. Data were subject to analysis of variance and Duncan’s multiple range test. Results showed that storage time and temperature had significant effects on pH. The lowest pH of Kefir was obtained by storing it for 10 days at 6 to 10oC. Titratable acidity was significantly affected by temperature, and kefir stored at 6 to 10oC has the highest titratable acidity. Storage time and temperature had no significant effects on water activity, and the average water activity of kefir was 0.875±0.028. Total LAB and total yeast were significantly affected by temperature, but not by storage time. In average, total LAB and total yeast in kefir were 7.17± 0.92 log cfu/ml and 6.76± 0.39 log cfu/ml, respectively. In conclusion, this study confirmed that temperature of storage has a major contribution to the characteristics of kefir made from goat milk; hence it has to be considered when handling kefir for a longer period of time. © 2015 Diponegoro University.

The objectives of this research were to define the heritability values of live weight, chest girth and body length in Ongole-crossbred cattle. Total of 37 blood samples were collected from parental cows and 2 blood samples from parental Ongole breed bulls. All blood samples were screened for the presence of growth hormone (GH) locus using PCR-RFLP method involving restricted enzyme Msp1 on agarose-gel (1.2%). Data were analyzed using statistical program in Excel XP. Results showed that the phenotypic estimation average of Ongole grade cattle population of live weight, chest girth and body length were 445.41 ± 45.95 kg, 175.35 ± 4.11 cm, and 139.70 ± 5.73cm, respectively. The heritability values of animal live weight, chest girth and body length in this study were 0.24, 0.003, and 0.41, respectively. These heritability values of animal live weight and body length would be categorized as moderate to high genotypic performance values, while the heritability of animal chest girth was included in low heritability standard of the animal economical trait performance. © 2015 Diponegoro University.

Twelve (12) male Madura cattle aged at 2 years old, 156.27+6.92 kg (CV 4.43%) of body weight were used in this study which was assigned to completely randomized design for three feeding treatments (low, middle and high energy contents) and four replications. The daily gain was measured for 90 days, while the blood metabolites were measured at the middle of experiment. Results showed that dietary energy levels did not affect (P>0.05) average daily gain, dry matter intake, dry matter digestibility, energy intake and feed conversion ratio. Blood glucose and blood urea concentration were ranged at 67-75 and 35-50 mg/dL, respectively, while feed energy efficiency reached 0.145 MJ/g ADG.

A total of 62 cows which consist of two Friesian Holstein cattle groups (from New Zealand=19 heads and Australia=43 heads) were used for the research. We performed the Polymerase Chain Reaction and followed by Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism using AluI restriction enzyme. The genotype was observed base on the target gene GH 211 bp in the part of intron 4 and exon 5 of growth hormone gene. The frequencies of genotypes LL were found higher than genotype LV in both groups. Friesian Holstein cattle from New Zealand showed the genotype LL and LV as 84% and 16%, respectively. Friesian Holstein cattle from Australia show the genotype LL and LV as 79% and 21%, respectively. The association between Leu/Val polymorphism on milk production, fat and protein content in both groups did not show the significant effect. Base on two groups of the origin of cattle, the result showed the significant different on fat and protein content of milk.

The first lactation records of 221 dairy cows from 2006 to 2014 were used. Heritabilities were estimated by paternal half-sib correlation. Comparison of average performances between daughter population (A) and initial dam population before selection ( ) were conducted by Z-test. Annual genetic gain was calculated as genetic gain per generation (the differences between A dan ) divided by generation interval. Heritabilities for milk fat percentage (FP), milk fat yield (FY), milk protein percentage (PP) and milk protein yield (PY) were 0.46, 0.30, 0.28 and 0.17, respectively. A significant increase (P=0.025) in the total milk yield (TMY) from the first generation (G1) to the second generation (G2) resulted in a high significant decrease in the FP (P=0.004). Genetic gains of TMY, FP and PP were 9.76 kg, -0.04% and -0.01% per year, respectively. It is concluded that selection for higher TMY only negatively affect FP and PP. Selection can be applied based on FY to avoid the decrease of FP. Negative effects of genetic-environmental interaction resulted in slower genetic gain because the imported cows needed time to adapt to the local environment. © 2015 Diponegoro University.

The research design applied was completely randomized design with 3 treatments and 5 replications Fifteen local male sheeps aged 9-12 months weighing 14-17 kg were divided into 3 groups for different ration treatments. The first group received only basal ration (R0), the 2nd group received basal ration and 3% of CPO (R1), while the 3rd group received basal ration and 3% of CPO protected by 2% of formaldehyde (R2). The data were analyzed by analysis of variance. The differences among treatments were tested by Duncan's New Multiple Range Test. The results showed that the addition of CPO protected by formaldehyde (R2) in the sheep diet increased lamb protein and fat content (P&lt;0.05), produced tenderer lamb (P&lt;0.01) with lower cooking loss (P&lt;0.01).

The research was conducted during twelve weeks in the housing of goat farmers at Purwomanunggal farmers' group, Panggang, Gunung Kidul district. Fifteen Bligon male goats, 8 months of age and 12 to 15 kg of body weight, were randomly divided into three treatments, each groups consisted of five goats. The treatments were: control feed (R0 ), one week fermented complete feed (R1), and two weeks fermented complete feed (R2). Data were analyzed with ANOVA based on one way completely randomized design and continued with Duncan's multiple range tests for significant differences. Result showed that complete feed fermented for two weeks had darker color and stronger odors compared with one week fermentation. Both fermented complete feed (one and two weeks) had soft textures, no fungi with pH ranged from 4.5 to 5.0. Total digestible nutrient (TDN) intake was significantly affected by the treatment. The treatment had no significant effect on acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber(NDF) digestibility, average daily gain, and farmer's income. © 2015 Diponegoro University.

Nine Bali cattle of 1.5-2 year old and 165-175 kg weight were grouped into three feeding trials. The first group P0 was fed ration containing 30% cacao shell fermented with its own microorganism and 70% corn straw, the second group P1 was fed ration containing 30% cacao shell fermented with ruminal fluid and 70% corn straw, and the third group P2 was fed ration containing 30% cacao shell fermented with Bioplus and 70% corn straw. All cattle were also given commercial concentrate amounting to 1% of their bodyweight. The cattle were slaughtered at the end of feeding trial and their carcasses, meat and non carcass components were analysed. Experimental design used was completely randomized design. The results showed that carcass percentage, back fat thickness, rib eye area and meat index of Bali cattle were as follows group PO 53.33%, 3.08 mm, 59.65 cm2, 0.79%; group P1 52.64%, 5.31 mm, 58.52 cm, 0.82% and group P2 5.32%, 5.7 mm, 57.75 cm, 0.79%, respectively. The marbling and cholesterol content of Bali beef were group PO 2.65% and 71.25 mg/100g, group P1 2.12% and 48.75 mg/100g, and P2 2.63% and 74.50 mg/100g. It could be concluded that fermented cacao shell could be used as feed ingredient without any effect on the carcass and meat quality, marbling and cholesterol contents of male Bali beef. © 2014 Diponegoro University.

Two strains lactic acid bacteria (LAB) i.e. Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus acidhophilus, and one strain yeast of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as probiotic.This experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design consisted of 4 treatments as follows grass silage (G); grass silage + concentrate without probiotic (G+A); grass silage + concentrate containing L. plantarum and. S. cerevisiae (G+B); grass silage + concentrate containing L. acidophilus and. S. cerevisiae (G+C); grass silage + concentrate containing L. plantarum and L. acidophilus (G+D). Data were analyzed as completely randomized design and followed by Duncan’s multiple range test. The results showed that the concentrate containing LAB varied 1.5 × 106 and 3 × 107 cfu/g, and 3 × 103 cfu/g of S. cerevisiae. Combination between L. plantarum and S. cerevisiae (G+B), and L. acidophilus and S. cerevisiae (G+C) in concentrate increased (P&lt;0.01) propionic acid proportion. The average CH4 production in concentrate containing probiotic (G+C, G+D and D+E) was lower by 6.9% (P&lt;0.01) compared to concentrate without probiotic (G+B). The in vitro dry matter (DM) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility were higher (P&lt;0.01) by 25.7% and 6.3% respectively, in grass silage substrate with concentrate containing probiotic (G+C, G+D and G+E) than in grass silage with concentrate without probiotic (G+B). In conclusion, addition of probiotic in concentrate could increase in vitro propionic acid proportion, DM and NDF digestibility and reduce CH4 production. © 2014 Diponegoro University.

The ex vivo experiment was conducted with 2 and 4 weeks old pigs based on the porcine intestinal organ culture (PIOC) model. The in vivo experiment was performed with 2 and 3 weeks old pigs fed milk replacer and inoculated with E. coli F18. E. coli F18 inoculation to the intestinal cultures resulted in higher (P<0.01) counts of E. coli associated to the intestinal tissue, but such difference was not observed between the 2 and 4 weeks old pigs. Faecal dry matter (DM) decreased (P=0.01), whereas the proportion of pigs with diarrhea and faecal haemolytic E. coli counts increased (P<0.05) following inoculation, however, the difference between the ages was not observed in the in vivo study. The interaction (P=0.01) between age and sampling day was observed for the number of total white blood cells (WBC). The proportion of neutrophils decreased (P=0.01), whereas the lymphocytes, red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) increased (P<0.01) after inoculation, but the differences between age groups were not observed regarding these variables.

Study was conducted in two stages, in which the first stage aimed to evaluate sodium silica as batik wax releasing agent on chrome leather. Completely randomized design (CRD) was applied in this study. The concentration of sodium silica was treated as treatments, in which Tl = 0, T2 = 2 g/L, T3: 4 g/L and T4 = 6 g/L. The second stage of the study was aimed to evaluate the type of dye used in batik method dyeing on chrome-tanned goat leather. CRD was used and the treatments were types of dye, i.e. T'1 = acid, T'2= indigosol, T'3 = napthol, T'4 = remazol. In both studies, 9 replicates were applied for each treatment. The use of sodium silicate concentration of 2 g/L resulted in the percentage of release wax of 91.4% and did not degrade the quality of chrome leather. The type of acid dyes and naphthol provided the best adhesion and color brightness and resistance to washing treatment, water, sweat, bend, and rub at 4/5 to 5 on a scale of gray.

This research used 84 Indonesian muscovy duck divided into 7 group of experimental diet, namely E0C0 : basal feed without Vitamin E and C supplementation, E400 : basal feed with 400 IU of Vitamin E supplementation, E600 : basal feed with 600 IU of Vitamin E supplementation, C400 : basal feed with 400mg vof itamin C supplementation, C600 : basal feed with 600mg of Vitamin C supplementation, E200C200 : basal with 200 IU of Vitamin E and 200mg of Vitamin C supplementation, E300C300 : basal feed with 300 IU of Vitamin E and 300mg of Vitamin C. A completely randomized design was applied and each treatment had 4 replications. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance. Analysis of variance showed that treatments significantly affect (P>0.01) meat quality, myoglobin level and TBARS level. Vitamin E and C was proven able to improve final pH of muscovy duck meat. Supplementation of 300 IU of Vitamin E and 300mg of Vitamin C at feed with 21% of protein and 3100 kcal/kg of energy could improve DIA, cooking loss, flavor, and color of muscovy duck meat; however, the highest meat tenderness was resulted from 400 IU Vitamin E supplementation. © 2014 Diponegoro University.

Research was conducted based on 2x3 of factorial completely randomized design, in which the first factor was 2 types of diet, i.e. RA : standard diet; RB : 85% standard diet + 15% swangi fish meal, and the second factor was 3 levels of period time of turmeric powder addition, i.e. P0 : without turmeric powder; P1 : turmeric powder 54 mg/quail/day was given since quail age 210 days old; P2 : turmeric powder 54 mg/quail/day was given since quail age 14 days old. Difference of means between treatment groups were analyzed by Duncan's Multiple Range Test in 95% significance level. The results showed that combined treatment of tumeric powder with RA (P0 : 2.33 μm; P1 : 3.06 μm; P2 : 2.98 μm) and RB (P0 : 2.22 μm; P1 : 3.12 μm; P2 : 2.92 μm) increased (P<0.05) muscle fiber diameter on major pectorales significantly. Muscle fiber diameter on semimembranosus were increased (P<0.05) by combined treatment of tumeric powder with RA (P0 : 2.83 μm; P1 : 3.50 μm; P2 : 3.24 μm) and RB (P0 = 2.85 μm; P1 = 3.28 μm; P2 = 3.33 μm). In conclusion, combined treatment of RA (standard diet) and RB (diet with Swangi fish meal) increased (P<0.05) the size of muscle fiber diameter in major pectorales and semimembranosus. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

Numbers of respondent were 122 households in urban area and 102 in rural area. Survey method was used to collect data using questionnaires presented to respondents. The data were analyzed quantitatively using a log linear multiple regression and binomial logistic regression models. Results of the research showed that milk price and mother's education background were highly significant factors in determining the milk consumption expenditure. Individually, the income was not significant factor. Furthermore, urban household group with higher mother's education and household income were different significantly with the rural one. A number of children who were less than 12 years old had significantly greater propensity to consume milk routinely. The program to increase milk consumption for children in growing age should be focused on improving the knowledge of mothers in low income communities especially in rural areas accompanied with required skills to get employment opportunities and extra cash income. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

Data on animal live weight (LW), body length (BL) and chest girth (CG) were collected from all cows (n=363) kept by traditional household farmers. Regression analysis was carried out to estimate LW from all linear body measurements. Data were classified based on age of animals consisted of five groups with the first age group of two and half years old, to the fifth age group of seven and half years old. The results showed that age significantly (P&lt;0.05) influenced all body measurements. Correlations between all pairs of measurements were highly significant (P&lt;0.001) for all age groups. Regression analysis showed that live weight could be predicted accurately from chest girth and body length (R 2 =0.97). Multiple regression model can be recommended to predict live weight of Ongole grade cows based on those variables with their age groups ranging from 2.5 to ≥7.5 years old as follows: Live weight (kg) = -806.410 + 4.79835 CG (cm) + 2.83500 BL (cm). © 2013 Diponegoro University.

Fifteen male local goats (18 months old with average body weight of 18 kg) were used in this study. Goats were divided randomly into 3 groups, and were fed TMR's those contained 15, 25, and 35% of sugarcane bagasse, respectively. All experimental diets were designed to be isoenergy and isoprotein. After 12 weeks of adaptation to experimental diets and environment, each group was subjected to feed digestibility trial, body composition, and experiment of feeding effect on serum glucose. The data were analyzed using one way analyses of variance. The results showed that the body composition and serum glucose concentration were not significantly different (P>0.05) among treatments. The bagasse portion in the TMR upto 25% lowered daily feed consumption and body weight gain (P<0.05). It was concluded that the use of sugarcane bagasse up to 35% in the TMR did not affect body composition of goats. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

The technical and economical efficiency was calculated to find out the status of duck farmer's business performance. The research was conducted to four most active duck farmer groups (KTTI) in Brebes Regency. The research was done based on survey method with 123 duck farmers of the group member as the respondents. The research results show that not all of the duck farmers performed their business efficiently (the average technical efficiency is 0.9981) since the number of duck ownership, forage, and the use of technology were not optimum yet. The return to scale value of the duck farming businesses was 1.0868, which showed the presence of opportunity to increase production. This research recommends that it is necessary to manage the production management in order to increase business performance by optimizing the number of duck ownership, forage feed, and the use of technology. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

Fifteen male Kacang goats weighing 14.28 ± 3.36 kg (CV = 23.55%) were divided into 5 groups based on body weight. The experimental design used in this study was Randomized Block Design (RBD) with 3 treatments of dietary protein and total digestible (TDN) contents (T1= diet with 9.20% protein and 54.67% TDN; T2= diet with 11.6% protein and 58.61% TDN; T3= diet with 18.33% protein and 65.23% TDN). Parameters observed were feed intake, dry matter intake, crude protein intake, TDN intake, live weight gain (LWG) and body composition of Kacang goat. The results showed that feed quality did not significantly affect (P>0.05) dry matter intake and body composition, but significantly affect (P<0.05) protein intake, TDN intake and LWG. It can be concluded that the higher quality diet resulted in higher productivity, but the higher quality diet was not affect body composition of Kacang goat, except body fat gain (%). © 2013 Diponegoro University.

Data were obtained from 120 randomly selected rams with approximately two and half years of age, from different extensively managed herds in Nasarawa State, Nigeria. Although pairwise phenotypic correlations indicated strong association (P&lt;0.01) among the measured variables, there was collinearity problem between BW and SC as revealed by the variance inflation factors (VIF) and tolerance valves (T). The VIT was higher than 10 (VIF = 19.45 and 16.65 for BW and SC, respectively). The Twas smaller than 0.1 (T = 0.05 and 0.06 in BW and SC, respectively). BW was retained among the collinear variables, and was singly accounted for 83.7% of the variation in BCS. However, a slight improvement was obtained from the prediction of BCS from BW and TL [coefficient of determination (2), adjusted 2 and root mean squares error (RMSE) were 85.3%, 85.1% and 0.305, respectively]. The prediction of the BCS of Yankasa rams from BW and testicular measurements could therefore be a potential tool for sustainable production and improvement of small ruminants in Nigeria. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

Sites in Biak were taken from Samofa District. Sites in Yapen were taken from South Yapen District comprised of Famboaman, Anotaurei, Mariadei and Mantembu villages. Site in Manokwari was chosen at Sub-district of Wosi. Participatory research using interview and observation was done towards 105 pig farmers. One-way analysis of variance and Pearson Chisquare (X2) were used to analyse data. Several indicators tested were age, education, objectives of rearing pigs, and species of pigs. The characteristics of pig farmers were similar. The variations of pig farmers' characteristics ware found in pigs' rearing experience, animal number and litter size. Offered feeding on each physiological period was different. Similar finding were feeding sources and feeding process. Reproduction knowledge and their experience in farrowing management are similar amongst the tribes. In general experiences and knowledge to prevent infectious diseases in general were similar. The three tribes have relatively similar in managing their pig farming systems. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

Effect of cultivar and harvest arranged in a nested design (3x2). The variables were observed consisting of morphological characteristics, dry matter production and forage quality. The results showed that the morphological characteristics, leaf stem ratio, fiber content, crude protein content and in vitro dry matter digestibility of Napier grass Taiwan and King cultivar were not different, but both morphological characteristics, fiber content was higher (P <0.05) compared to Mott cultivar, whereas leaf stem ratio, crude protein content and in vitro dry matter digestibility Mott cultivar was higher (P <0.05) compared to Taiwan and King cultivars. In general, an increase in plant height and fiber content at the age of 13 weeks, whereas crude protein content and in vitro dry matter digestibility decreased. It was concluded that the highest dry matter production found in Taiwan and the King cultivars, whereas highest quality found in Mott cultivar. Dry matter production was highest harvested at 13 weeks, whereas the highest quality harvested at 8 weeks after planting for all cultivars tested. crops (Hanna et al., 2004). Napier grass has been introduced to all tropical area and grows naturally throughout Southeast Asia where the annual rainfall is about 1000 mm (Mannetje and Jones, 1992). Napier grass plants can live in soil where other plants are relatively critical not grow well (Sanderson and Paul, 2008). Several cultivars have been developed in Indonesia such cultivar of Africa, Hawaii, Trinidad, Merkeri, King, Taiwan and Mott (Budiman et al., 2011) and varieties of Thailand (Hidayat, 2010). Napier grass is vegetaively propagated and can withstand repeated cutting and rapidly regenerates producing forage which is palatable to cattle at the leafy stage (Maria et al., 2010). © 2012 Diponegoro University.

The first factor was the level of inoculums (I) i.e. I1 (without inoculum), I2 (5 g/kg seed), I3 (10 g/kg seed), and I4 (15 g/kg seed). The second factor was harvesting time (U) i.e. U1 (60 days), U2 (80 days), U3 (100 days) with 4 replications. The variables were N uptake, production of dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM), and percentage of OM, crude protein (CP), crude fiber (CF), nitrogen free extract (NFE), extract ether (EE) and ash of arbila forage (based on DM). The results showed that inoculant treatment at the rate of 15 g/kg seed produced the highest percentage of effective nodules (98.72%), and in combination with harvesting age at 100 days each polybag of plant was able to absorb the higest amount of N (688. 10 g) with production of DM 273.81 g, OM production 263.96 g and nutrients content based on DM of about 91.14% OM, 33.52% CF, 34.76%, 5.75% EE, 09.37% ash, and 16.16% CP. From the study, it can be concluded that arbila plants inoculated specific rhizobium Phaseolus vulgaris at the rate of 15 g/kg seed and harvested at 100 days yielded the best forage as feed. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

This district was choosen because beside it was famous as the center of laying hen farms, it was also as one of districts in South Sulawesi which suffered from Avian influenza outbreak. Total samples were 60 respondents. The samples were choosen through stratified random sampling from two subdistricts which had the most populous of layer smallholders, namely Baranti and Maritengngae. Data were obtained through observations and interviews using a questionnaire. Data were analyzed using a score based on biosecurity status. Biosecurity status was obtained based on the adoption of biosecurity measures which consisted of 9 stages: farm inputs, traffic onto farms, distance from sources of pathogens to shed, exposure of farm, biosecurity at farm boundary, biosecurity between farm boundary and shed, biosecurity at the shed door, traffic into the shed and susceptibility of the flock. Multiple regression model was employed to analyze the data. The study revealed that the adoption biosecurity were associated with gender, age, education, farming experience, farm-income, family size and social capital. These variables contributed 20% variation in biosecurity adoption of laying hen farms. However, only farm income, family size and social capital were the major factors influencing to the adoption of biosecurity (P<0.05). © 2012 Diponegoro University.

Five districts were purposively chosen for research location based on the number of beef cattle population, namely Rembang, Blora, Grobogan, Boyolali and Wonogiri. Forty respondents of each district were chosen randomly using quota sampling. Data were analyzed through Simultaneous Regression and estimated by Two Stage Least Square (TSLS). The results showed that independent variables were simultaneously significant to dependent variables (production, income, farm household consumption and investment) with the Probability F test 0.0000 and adjusted R2 were 91%; 89%; 96%; 62%, respectively. The simulation's analysis of agribusiness implementation consisted of 1) decreasing 15% of service per conception, 2) increasing of beef cattle breed and number of beef cattle 15% respectively, 3) raising of price of rice and number of household member 15% respectively and 4) increasing of income and price of beef cattle 10% respectively influenced to farm household consumption and investment 0.446% and 5.14%, respectively, meanwhile production and income did not change.

This economic loss would be as a direct result when animals poisoned by BoNTs or indirectly when the livestock products are contaminated by BoNTs, which end up with the products are banned by authority. Therefore a routine surveillance of BoNTs in the farm and in livestock product processing industry is urgently needed. One of the most relatively quick and accurate methods to perform a routine detection of the presence of BoNTs is enzyme-linkage immunosorbant assay (ELISA). In this article we describe the results of the development of ELISA, using polyclonal antibodies against BoNTs-B produced locally. Antibodies were generated from six Balb/c mice with standard immunological methods. Mice were immunized three times for a period of 8 weeks with a commercial type B Clostridium botulinum toxoid at a dose of 100 ng per mouse per injection. The resulting antibody was purified by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation 50% (w/v) technique and a protein A column method. The results of this preliminary study indicated that the developed ELISA method capable of detecting type B Clostridium botulinum toxin up to 1.0 ng/ml. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

Three fistulated sheep were fed on urea-treated rice straw basal diet with three supplemental treatment diets which consisted of control diet (T0) mulberry and molasses; mulberry, rice bran and urea (T1); and rice bran and urea (T2). Either URS or TRS was placed in nylon bags and incubated in the rumen at 0, 8, 16, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Parameters recorded were degradation of DM and NDF, rumen pH, rumen ammonia. The results showed that DM degradability of URS of the diet T1 was significantly lower than other diets. Similarly the URS degradability of rumen-insoluble fraction (b) of DM and NDF of T1 diet was significantly lower than those of T0 and T2 diet. DM and NDF degradability of URS was not affected by diets. The rumen ammonia concentration of T1 and T2 was significantly higher than those T0, but still higher than critical ammonia concentration required for rumen microbial synthesis. These results suggest that different supplementations have no significant effect on DM and NDF degradability of TRS. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

This protein is a member of a superfamily of molecules called transforming growth factors beta (TGF-b). Deletion in c.960delG (1-bp deletion at position 960) disrupts the reading frame from amino acid (aa) position 320 to ending in a premature stop codon in aa position 359 have been found in Norwegian White Sheep. This deletion in the myostatin gene is responsible to increase muscle mass, also known as 'double muscling', in sheep. The purpose of this study was to identify the polymorphism of myostatin gene in c.960delG locus of local sheep in Indonesia. The 832 DNA sampels from sheep were collected from 13 populations belonging to the Priangan (86), Javanese Thin Tail (389 i.e. Jonggol, Banjar, Ciomas), Javanese Fat Tail (94), West Nusa Tenggara (136), Rote Island/East Nusa Tenggara (35), Kisar Island/Southwest Maluku (22), Donggala/South East Celebes (45) and Batur cross breed/Wonosobo, Central Java (25). A gene fragment of MSTN c.960delG length 299 bp was successfully amplified by using the technique of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and genotyped by SSCP (single strand conformation polymorphism). The result showed no polymorphism in this gene. All sheep tested had G/G genotype for c.960delG locus. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

In this experiment, microbial synthesis and N balance were assessed. The daily rations were either unsupplemented barley meal (BM), or BM supplemented with one of three nitrogen sources. All rations were isocaloric (3.0 Mcal ME/kg DM) and the N supplements were soybean meal (BSBM), cottonseed meal (BCSM) or urea (BU) to provide 2.9% N in the concentrate component. The unsupplemented BM contained 1.7% N. The addition of N supplements to the ration enhanced N utilization in dairy goats. The organic matter (OM) intake, N intake, N balance, and microbial N synthesis for BM, BSBM, BCSM and BU were 660.5 g, 721.9 g, 728.1g and 703.5 g; 13.5 g, 21.5 g, 20.9 g and 20.7 g; 2.7 g; 7.1 g, 5.4 g, and 5.7 g; and 14.1 g 19.1 g, 19.1 g, and 20.0 g, respectively. It can be concluded that when sufficient dietary energy was available for ruminal microbial activities, the source of N did not affect N balance, and microbial N synthesis. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

A total of 160 birds were used in present experiment which was arranged in a Completely Randomized Design with 4 treatments and 5 replications (8 birds each). Dietary inclusions of Ca-PFA of 0, 5, 10 and 15% were reflected as R0, R1, R2 and R3, respectively. Results of the experiment showed that growth performance based on the feed consumption significantly decreased (p<0.05), but there were no significant (p>0.05) effect for final body weight, carcass percentage and carcass composition. The inclusion of Ca-PFA in the diet was not affected the saturated fatty acid (p>0.05), but showed significant effect on unsaturated fatty acid and omega-3 fatty acid (p<0.05). Body fat distribution was not affected by inclusion level of Ca- PFA at a level of 15%. In conclusion, the inclusion of Ca-PFA in the diet until 15% decreased feed consumption and produced similar growth performance, however it increased unsaturated fatty acid, omega-3 fatty acids and decreased body fat of broiler. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

The randomized block design with 4 treatments and 4 replications were used in the research. In this study was used 16 Bali cattle with body weight around 295.31+23.07 kg. Rations used in the treatments were Treatment A (control): Rice straw ad libitum plus commercial feed; Treatment B: Treatment A ration plus 0.2% Vitamin-mineral in commercial feed; Treatment C: Treatment A ration plus 0.3% Vitamin-mineral in commercial feed, and Treatment D: Treatment A ration plus 0.4% Vitamin-mineral in commercial feed. Parameters measured were nutrient digestibility, rumen metabolites and urinary allantoin. The results showed that supplementation of Vitamin-mineral at 0.2 - 0.4% in commercial feed did not increase the digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein and crude fiber, except for dry matter and organic matter digestibilities at 0.2% supplementation (p<0.05). However, the Vitamin-mineral supplementation increased concentrations of partial VFA and ammonia as well as for methane gas production, except for VFA and ammonia at 0.4% level. Vitamin-mineral supplementation at 0.2-0.4% level did not affected pH value of rumen fluid and urinary allantoin. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

The intakes and digestibility of the diet by G and S were compared. Both species consumed the same level of the diet. G digested dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, crude fiber, and lignin of the diet to a significant higher extent than did by S. The superiority of G over S in digesting the diet was attributable with longer retention time of ruminal fluid and particulate matters in the rumen and the entire gut, which then resulted in higher proportion of small size particles (<1 mm sieve), higher proportions of propionic, butyric, valeric and isovaleric acid concentrations produced in the rumen. Additionally for further studies, there were some possibilities of G having a better chewing activity (duration and intensity), and ability to maintain higher rumen ammonia levels by a greater urea recycle to the rumen, particularly through salivation. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

Six diets (wheatbased, rice hull-based, plant protein-based, millrun-based, MOS, and bentonite) were used and were randomly given to 6 groups of ISA Brown hens, with 18 replicates per group and 5 birds per replicate for 8 weeks. The results showed that diets did not have a significant effect (P>0.05) on cannibalism mortality, but numerically the rice hull diet gave the lowest effect, the millrun gave the intermediate effect, whereas the plant protein diet gave the largest negative effect. Diet significantly affected feed intake (P<0.01), egg production (P<0.01), feed to egg ratio (P<0.01) and egg weight (P<0.05). Birds on millrun diet had the lowest intake, but the feed to egg ratio was superior and egg production was the highest compared to those fed other diets. In contrast, the feed to egg ratio in rice hull diet was inferior, and egg weight was also lighter than those fed other diets. In conclusion, fibre sources have been verified as contributing factors involved in the outbreak of cannibalism in laying hens. Diets containing high insoluble NSP had a potential to decrease the mortality due to cannibalism. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

Four week-old male Wistar rats were divided into three groups based on weight. All rats were induced with diabetes mellitus by single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin at 45 mg/kg body weight. Thereafter, they were randomly distributed to three treatments with 7 rats assigned to each treatment. One group was the control with no additive, and twotreatment groups were given the purified diets supplemented with 1% or 2% FCME. Experimental results showed that in comparison to the control, diabetic rats fed FCME increased feed intake (P<0.01) and body weight gain (P<0.05). FCME inclusion significantly reduced the activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (P<0.01) and fatty acid synthetase (P<0.05) in diabetic rats. FCME significantly increased cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase with no effect on HMG-CoA reductase activity. FCME had no effect on hepatic triglyceride, free cholesterol and phospholipid. FCME inclusion at 1% level significantly reduced serum triglyceride. FCME significantly increased HDL-cholesterol (P<0.05) with no effect on LDL + VLDL-cholesterol, and significantly reduced atherogenic index. FCME did not significantly affect serum insulin and glucose concentration. In conclusion, FCME supplementation altered lipid metabolism in diabetic rats. FCME supplementation reduced the risk of atherosclerosis in diabetic rats. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

The chicks were randomly allocated into 4x2x4 factorial and fed on a commercial starter diet (250 g CP and 12.5 MJ of ME /kg) from hatching to 5 d of age and divided into two groups with three replications each of 16 birds and given either the such starter diet (S) or a finisher diet (F) containing 190 g CP and 13.0 MJ of ME /kg. The birds were reared in strain-and sex-intermingled groups in brooders and followon cages until they reached the target body weight of 600-650 g (females) or 650-700 g (males) and transferred to single cages and fed S or F diet until 1200-1300 g (females) or 1300-1400 g (males). The lighting program was 23 h light for the first two days, and reduced to 18 h/d for the remainder of the experiment. There were considerable variations in relative growth performance, FCR, carcass fat and abdominal fat due to genotypes and dietary regimen. Although birds tend to response in similar way when dealing with the excesses and insufficient supply, the nutrient requirements in relation to the protein: energy ratios should be designed according to genetic background. The accumulation of fat during the growing period was primarily due to the genetic variation whereas beyond this age, variation in abdominal fat was due principally to dietary effects. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

Two hundred and ten birds of one-week-male broiler chicken were divided into seven kinds of one-way treatment of completely randomized design. Five replications were used for each treatment; there were six chickens in each replication. The substitution levels of corn in broiler ration by USCW and FSCW were 0% (control), 10, 20, and 30%. The result showed that corn substitution up to 20% using USCW and FSCW did not affect the digestibility of feed (DF), digestibility of soluble protein (DSP) and crude protein (DCP), and digestibility of starch (DS). Substitution up to 30% using FSCW did not affect the DSP and DCP. However, substitution of USCW at the same level decreased DSP, DCP, DF, and DS. Corn substitution up to 20% using USCW and FSCW did not affect the feed intake (FI), body weight gain (BWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Substitution up to 30% using FSCW did not affect the BWG and FCR. However, substitution of USCW at the same level decreased BWG and increased FCR. FSCW can be used as a substitute for the corn up to 30% without affecting the performance and the values of the nutrient digestibility, meanwhile USCW is only able to substitute corn up to 20%. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

The experimental diets were: R1 (control diet = 70% field grass + 30% concentrate), R2 (70% field grass + 25% concentrate + 5% NRS), R3 (70% field grass + 20% concentrate + 10% NRS) and R4 (70% field grass + 15% concentrate + 15% NRS). A randomized block design with four treatments and four replications was carried out. Buffalo rumen fluid was taken in different time and was used as block or replication. Data were analyzed by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Significant differences among treatments were determined by contrast orthogonal. The results showed that total gas production and total VFA concentration were highest (P&lt;0.05) in R4 among the treatments. Addition of 15% NRS in complete ration (R4) increased NH3 concentration 10.34%. Addition of 10% NRS and 15% NRS in complete ration (R3 and R4) improved the microbial biomass product compared to control and 5% NRS in complete ration (R1 and R2). Dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) degradability were significantly higher (P&lt;0.01) in 10% NRS and 5% NRS in complete ration (R3 and R2) compared to control and 15% NRS in complete ration (R1 and R4). It was concluded that combination between 70% field grass, 20% concentrate and 10% NRS in complete ration (R3) was more optimal for improving gas production, total VFA, NH3 concentration, microbial biomass product, dry matter degradability and organic matter degradability, compared to control ration. © 2009 Diponegoro University.

Seventeen plants were used as a database for the above mentioned purposes. Plant samples were determined for their chemical composition, cumulative gas production (represents the nutrient degradation) and methane production after 24 hours of fermentation period using the Hohenheim gas test. The results showed that the PCA could clearly identify factors related to forage quality and methane production and separated them into different principal components (PC). The obtained PC1 was related to methane production and substantially influenced positively by crude protein, NDF, ADF (positive), total phenols, total tannins, condensed tannins and tannin activity (negative). On the other hand, the obtained PC2 was related to cumulative gas production (forage quality) and substantially influenced by crude protein (positive), NDF, ADF and condensed tannins (negative). Classification and screening of forages that have high quality and low methane production are possible using the PCA technique.

Fauna 3, Yogyakarta, 55281, Indonesia","This research was arranged with a 4x3 factorial design of treatments to investigate the effect of saponin level in fermentation medium (0, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 mg/ml), and many kinds of feed (king grass, rice bran, and king grass:rice bran, 60:40 w/w) on protozoa numbers, ammonia concentration, microbial protein, pH and cellullase activity. Each treatment was consisted of three replicates. Fermentation was done in syringe and used in vitro gas production medium. The data obtained were analyzed by variance analysis using factorial design (4x3). The differences between mean values were analyzed by Duncan's new multiple range test (DMRT). The result showed that protozoa numbers decreased 17.22, 42.73 and 49.57% (P&lt;0.01) for 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/ml saponin, respectively from 8.19×103/ml in the control. The addition of 0.1 mg/l saponin increased ammonia concentration from 33.04 mg/100 ml (without saponin) to 37.12 mg/100 ml (P&lt;0,01), whereas the addition of 0.2 and 0.3 mg/ml saponin decreased ammonia concentrations by 1.69 and 16.50% (P&lt;0.01) compared to the control. Microbial protein, cellullase activity and pH were not affected neither by saponin nor kind of feed. Protozoal numbers and ammonia concentration in the rumen were lower (P&lt;0.01) with king grass as substrat than that with rice bran, or king grass: rice bran. In general, no interactions between saponin and kind of feed were observed, except for ammonia concentration. It can be concluded that level of 0.2 mg/ml saponin have antimicrobial properties, particularly in suppressing protozoa, which may prove beneficial to ruminal fermentation and may lead to lower ruminal ammonia concentration, but it did not have negative effect on pH, microbial protein and cellullase activity. King grass as a substrate decreases protozoa numbers and ammonia concentration. © 2009 Diponegoro University.

Five testis of Bali bull collected from slaughter house were used in this study. Epididymal spermatozoa were collected through slicing and flushing methods, pressing cauda epididymal was conducted in NaCl physiology (NaCl 0.9%) emulsion. Spermatozoa which collected were divided into three reaction tube and each diluted by Tris dilution containing: Tris dilution + 20% of yolk (control); Tris dilution + 20% of yolk + 0.3 g of maltose/100ml (M0.3); and Tris dilution + 20% of yolk + 0.6 g maltose/100 ml (M0.6). Spermatozoa qualities observed were motile spermatozoa (MS), live-spermatozoa (LS) and intact-plasma membrane (IPM) that evaluated daily in refrigerator at temperature of 5°C. Completely Randomized Design with three treatments and five replications was used in this study. Data was analyzed by analysis of variance. Examination on fresh spermatozoa showed that spermatozoa concentration was 11,222.5 million cell/ml, motile spermatozoa was 75.00%, live-sperm was 86.75%, abnormal spermatozoa was 10.50%, cytoplasmic droplet was 14.00% and IPM was 86.75%. At the seventh day of preservation, the percentages of MS, LS and IPM in M0.3 were 37.0 %, 49.2% and 50.4%, respectively, and M0.6 were 38.05%; 51.8 % and 52.0%, respectively that were significantly higher (P<0.05) than control (29.0%; 41.8% and 42.4%, respectively). It was concluded that maltose added into Tris dilution could lengthen epididymal spermatozoa quality of Bali bull which persevered at 5°C. © 2009 Diponegoro University.

The objective of this study was to perform allele and genotype frequencies, and association of melanocortin 4 receptor with growth traits in Bligon goat. Seventy seven blood samples were collected and DNA isolated successfully. One pair primers were used for PCR of MC4R gene (F: 5’-TCGGGCGTCTTGTTCATCAT-3’ and R: 5’-CAAGACTGGGCACTGCTTCA-3’). Two SNPs (g.998A/G and g.1079C/T) were identified in exon of Bligon MC4R by DNA sequencing and PCR-RFLP. The SNP g.998A/G identified amino acid change from isoleucine to methionine (I-M), while the SNP g.1079C/T was synonymous polymorphism. Based on relationship analysis between Genotype of MC4R gene (SNP g.998A/G) and growth traits indicated that GG genotype was lowest in weaning weight (WW; AA=13.0±1.7; AG=11.2±3.6; GG=9.2±3.9), weaning body length (WBL; AA=46.8±2.4; AG=46.3±6.0; GG=43.8±5.3) and weaning chest circumference (WCC; AA=50.9±4.0; AG=50.7±4.6; GG=47.1±7.3) compare to AA and AG genotype (p<0.05). Individual with CC and CT genotypes at SNP g.1079C/T had higher (P<0.05) in WW (CC=12.6±2.1; CT=12.5±2.5) and average daily gain (ADG; CC=81.2±21.8; CT=79.3±26.2) than TT genotype (WW=10.6±3.1; ADG=58.3±30.5). This results suggested that SNP g.998A/G and g.1079C/T of MC4R gene could be used as the genetic marker of growth traits for selection in Bligon goat. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

A specific Pit-1|HinfI gene polymorphism located within exon 6 (g.1256G>A) has been shown to be associated with growth and milk traits in cattle. This study aimed to identify the Pit-1|Hinf1 gene polymorphism in Grati-Ongole Grade cattle (Grati-OG cattle). A total of 107 genomic DNA of Grati-OG cattle were used in this study. The detection of polymorphism was performed by PCR-RFLP method. Only AB and BB genotypes were succesfully identified with the frequency of 0.009 and 0.991, respectively. Whereas, the frequency of A and B alleles were 0.005 and 0.995, respectively. The observed genotype frequencies in this population do not deviated from HWE. The value of Ho, He and PIC were 0.009, 0.009 and 0.009, respectively. In conclusion, the Pit-1|HinfI gene polymorphism in Grati-OG cattle is monomorphic and hence it should not be used in further association studies. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

Eight smallholder dairy farms located in livestock business area (KUNAK) were purposive selected with criteria was they had 11 heads dairy cows, planted an elephant grass, dispose the manure to grassland, did not use chemicals fertilizer, 4250 m 2 land area of dairy farming. Data were analyzed by: 1) attribute determination, 2) ordinal scale determination based on sustainability criteria; 3) data analysis (Rap Dairy software); 4) assessment of index and sustainability status; 5) review sensitive attributes (leverage analysis) and 6) validation model (Monte Carlo and Square Correlation (SQR) analysis). Attributes and ordinal scale on ecological sustainability were density of dairy cow, carrying capacity, supply water, drainage cages, soil fertility, topography, rainfall, humidity, temperature and altitude. Results of Rap Dairy analysis showed that smallholder dairy farms who apply LEISA pattern ecologically was quite sustainable with index of 57.95. The index could be increased to 88.39 (sustainable) through model simulation with respect to sensitive attributes. The results of Leverage analysis showed that topography, density of dairy cow, carrying capacity, supply water availability were sensitive attributes. Analysis Monte Carlo and SQR showed that model could explain data well. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

Broiler industry is one of the sectors that might be threatened by trade liberalization. This study aims to analyze the competitiveness and government policies impact on the broiler competitiveness in actual and free trade condition. This research was conducted in Bogor and Subang using survey method. The sample consisted of 30 local farmers selected by random sampling and an integrated company selected purposively. Further data is analyzed using Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM). Privat Cost Ratio (PCR) and Domestic Resource Cost Ratio (DRCR) analysis showed that small farm has a competitive advantage, but does not have a comparative advantage. While the production by integrated company has comparative and competitive advantages. The policy analysis indicates that overall policies is protective and give benefit to producers. There are three scenarios that are used to portray free trade: reduction in import tariffs, interest rates, and logistics costs. The implementation of free trade will reduce competitiveness in actual price but increase competitiveness in the undistorted market condition. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

A total of 75 breeder hens and 15 cockerel of Kedu chicken aged ± 12 months, with average body weight of 1667 ± 237 and 2295 ± 250 g/bird, respectively, were distributed into 15 units of semi intensive housing system. A completely randomized designed (CRD) was arranged in the present research with 3 dietary treatments, namely farmer formulated ration (T0), improved ration (T1), and T1 + 6.28 mg/kg vitamin E (T2). Parameters observed were feed consumption, consumption and retention of vitamin E, egg’s vitamin E, egg’s vitamin E deposition efficiency, hen day production (HDP) and egg weight. All data gathered were subjected to analysis of variance and Duncan’s multiple range test to differentiate between treatments. Variables, except feed consumption, HDP and egg weight, were significantly (P<0.05) influenced by dietary treatment. Vitamin E consumption and retention, and deposition increased due to feeding effect of improved diet and supplementation of vitamin E. Dietary vitamin E of farmer’s ration deposited into the egg indicated the highest value (229.23%) followed by improved ration (51.85%), and improved ration + vitamin E was the lowest (5.38%). In conclusion, Kedu hen is likely have a limitation on vitamin E deposited into the egg when the improved ration supplemented with vitamin E is fed, and vitamin E supplementation should be implemented together with the increase of fat content in the ration. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

The research material was semen sexing consisted of 2 layers those were top layer and bottom layer. The quality of frozen semen sexing was observed by comparing the pre-freezing technique (factory standard operating procedure: FSOP) according to the Artificial Insemination Center operating procedure (pre-freezing by placing the straw of semen for about 4 cm above liquid nitrogen for 9 minutes) with the modification procedure (MP), pre-freezing by placing the straw of semen 16 cm above liquid nitrogen for 9 minutes and then it was lowered to 4 cm above liquid nitrogen for 9 minutes during the pre-freezing phase. The parameters observed were motility, progressive motility, hyperactivation, and sperm linearity. Data were analyzed using Student's t-test. The results of this study indicated that the quality of sexed-semen in the standard operating procedures of frozen semen compared to the treatment of modifications to the top and bottom layers were motility at the top layer (46.06 ± 7.52% vs 55.6 ± 7.78%) and bottom layer (36.82 ± 6.49% vs. 41.47 ± 6.57%); progressive top layer (16.34 ± 4.27 vs. 32.83 ± 5.9%) and bottom layer 15.97 ± 2.72% vs. 19.79 ± 3.97%); hyperactivity in the top layer (0.81 ± 0.6% vs 4.09 ± 1.98%) and the bottom layer (0.71 ± 0.68% vs. 1.50 ± 1.05%); linearity consisted of linear and non-linear, the top layer (12.19 ± 2.94 vs. 20.52 ± 3.97%) and bottom layer (12.32 ± 2.63 vs 14.70 ± 2.6); while non-linear in top layer (0.14 ± 0.2 vs 0.68 ± 0.85%) and bottom layer (0.4 ± 0.13% vs 0.34 ± 0.4%). The conclusions in this study indicated that the quality of the frozen sexed-semen that has processed by pre-freezing modification technique was better than the frozen sexed-semen obtained from the Artificial Insemination Center Standard Operating procedure. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

A factorial arangment based on a completely randomized design was performed using two levels of feed restriction (10 and 20% less than the standard Ross strain 308 guidelines), two levels of restriction duration (7 and 14 days) and three levels of coenzyme Q10 (0, 20 and 40 mg/kg feed). The results of the experiment showed that restriction intensity had significant effect on feed intake in first, second and sixth weeks of age (P<0.05), body weight gain in second and sixth weeks of age (P<0.05), and feed conversion ratio in first week of age (P<0.05). Restriction duration had significant effect on feed intake in third week of age (P<0.05), and feed conversion ratio in third and sixth weeks of age (P<0.05). Coenzyme Q level had significant effect on feed intake in first and sixth weeks of age (P<0.05), body weight gain in second, fifth and sixth weeks of age (P<0.05), and feed conversion ratio in second and sixth weeks of age (P<0.05). In conclusion, considering the positive effects of feed restriction and coenzyme Q10 on broiler yield, the simaltaneous use of feed restriction strategy and dietary coenzyme Q10 can be considered as a management program in order to improvement of broiler productivity © 2018 Diponegoro University.

Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui keragaman gen leptin berdasarkan perubahan basa pada sekuen nukleotida (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism/SNP) di gen leptin pada sapi Peranakan Ongol (PO). Sampel DNA diperoleh dari 48 ekor sapi PO di Balai Pengembangan Perbibitan Ternak Sapi Potong (BPPT-SP) Cijeungjing Jawa Barat, yang diisolasi dari sel darah putih dengan metode garam pekat. Perbanyakan DNA dengan Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), dilanjutkan dengan sekuensing untuk mendapatkan sekuen nukleotida. Analisis SNP dilakukan dari pensejajaran (alignment) hasil sekuensing menggunakan program Bioedit dan MEGA 5.2. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan pada gen leptin exon 2 sapi PO ditemukan satu SNP yang tidak mengubah pengodean asam amino serin pada posisi g.1025T>C/S17S dan dua SNP yang mengubah pengodean asam amino g.1047C>T/R25C, yaitu Arginin menjadi sistein dan g.1048G>A/R25H yang mengubah Arginin menjadi Histidin. Pada sapi PO frekuensi alel A (44,8%) lebih tinggi dari alel C (33,3%) dan alel T (21,9%). Terdapat enam genotip, yaitu AA (41,7%) frekuensinya lebih tinggi dari genotipe CC (20,8%), CT (20,8%), CA(4,2%), TT (10,4%) dan TA (2,1%). Keragaman genetik berdasarkan gen leptin pada sapi PO adalah 0,65 yang termasuk dalam kategori tinggi. Alel A adalah alel spesifik pada sapi lokal Indonesia. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

A total of 192 birds of 21 days old broiler with initial body weight of 481 ± 67 g were divided into 8 treatments and 4 replications (6 birds each) of a completely randomized design (CRD). Dietary treatments were T0: 21% intact protein ration, T1: 18% intact protein ration, T2: 21% microparticle protein ration, T3: 18% microparticle protein ration, T4: T0 + 1.2 mL Lactobacillus sp, T5: T1 + 1.2 mL Lactobacillus sp., T6: T2 + 1.2 mL Lactobacillus sp., and T7: T3 + 1.2 mL Lactobacillus sp. Parameters observed were total lactic acid bacteria and Coliform, pH, blood cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), meat cholesterol, meat weight, feed consumption, and body weight gain (BWG). Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and followed by Duncan test (P<0.05). The results showed that T7 treatment significantly (P<0.05) decreased blood cholesterol, LDL, and meat cholesterol, but increased HDL, meat weight, and BWG. Blood cholesterol, LDL, and meat cholesterol were indicated significantly (P<0.05) lowest values due to T7 treatment. In conclusion, feeding 18% microparticle protein with addition of 1.2 mL Lactobacillus sp. can improves blood status and increases broiler productivity. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

The research used 19 Ongole Grade (OG) and 18 Simental-Ongole Crossbred (SOC) heifers. This research applied purposive sampling to determine the research population. The criteria to select the population were heifers which have in mature body. The normality of heifer’s reproductive organs were identified by performing rectal palpation, then 50 mg of medroxy progesterone acetate on vaginal sponge was used to synchronized estrus. The estrus heifer was inseminated using frozen semen. The observed parameters were the number of heifers with normal and abnormal reproductive organs, estrus sign and pregnancy. Data were analyzed descriptively. This study showed that OG and SOC with abnormal reproductive organs was 1 heifer (5.56%) and 7 heifers (36.84%), respectively. The responses of estrus synchronization in heifers with normal and abnormal reproductive organs were 94.17% and 100% in OG, and 100% and 42.86% in SOC. Meanwhile, the pregnancy rate was 70.59 and 0% in OG, and 50.00 and 0% in SOC. In conclusion, the number of SOC heifers with abnormal reproductive organs is higher than OG.

Research has been conducted using a completely randomized design with 4 treatments and 5 replications utilize 15 chickens. Lactobacillus sp. 5.8 x 107 CFU/mL was mixed in drinking water and also feed commercial concentrates together ad libitum. The results showed that treatment had significant effect (P &lt;0.05) on weight gain, ration conversion, and final weight. There was no difference (P&gt;0.05) ration consumption on doses of Lactobacillus sp. treatment 0 mL/days, 1 ml/days, 3 ml/days, and 5 ml/days. In general, the probiotic treatments of 1, 3, and 5 mL/days of lactobacillus sp. were better at villus height, villus surface area, weight gain, final weight, and feed conversion compared to control. Treatment a dose of 3 mL / d (1.7 x 108 CFU) is the best dose in providing optimal response to histology of the small intestine, and broiler performance. Treatment 5 mL/days has the lowest amount of Escherichia coli in manure of broiler. In conclusion, Lactobacillus sp. can be used as one candidate probiotic for broiler. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

This study was aimed to identify polymorphism of indel g.81966364D>I in promoter region of ADIPOQ gene and SNP c.-312A>G in 5' UTR of EDG1 gene in Indonesian beef cattle. Blood samples were collected from 211 cattle, including Bali (44), Madura (20), Pesisir (18), Katingan (20), PO (22), Pasundan (20), SO (12), Brahman (20), Simmental (15) and Limousin (18). Polymorphism of ADIPOQ gene was analyzed using PCR and direct sequencing methods, whereas EDG1 gene was analyzed using PCR-RFLP (MscI enzyme) and direct sequencing methods. Results of genotyping indel g.81966364D>I was monomorphic (DD genotype). The SNP c.-312A>G was polymorphic (AA and AG genotype) in Madura, Pesisir, Pasundan, Brahman, and Limousine. The Frequencies of allele A and G were 0.95, 0.92, 0.98, 0.95, 0.94 and 0.05, 0.08, 0.02, 0.05, 0.06 respectively. The values of Ho and He were 0.05-0.17 and 0.05-0.15 respectively and in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P>0.05). In Bali, Katingan, PO, SO and Simmental were monomorphic (GG genotype). In Bali cattle, two novel SNP candidates were found in position of c.-399C>T and c.-273C>G which were potential to be used as genetic markers of marbling score for Bali cattle. As result this study, it can be concluded that ADIPOQ gene was similar while EDG1 gene was different in Indonesian beef cattle. in addition, found two candidates potential SNP in Bali cattle. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

This study used 32 heads of OG bull with a completely randomized design that were divided to four different LW groups, i.e. group I was 170 to <210kg, group II was 210 to <250kg, group III was 250 to <290kg and group IV was 290 to 330kg. Parameters: observed were libido, testosterone hormone, LH, and semen quality. Data were analyzed by ANOVA. Libido of OG bull in group II and III higher than those in group IV. The testosterone hormone and LH showed that group II, III and IV were better than group I. The highest LH was in group IV, but low levels of testosterone were observed in these respective groups. Live sperm was the lowest in group I (21.25±13,20%) than II (66.00±11.17%), III (59.80±22.20%) and IV (75,67±9.46%).

A total of 100 adult male and 100 adult female Muscovy ducks. The research location was determined by purposive random sampling, while the determination of farmers and Muscovy ducks was done incidentally. Observations were made on each Muscovy duck by observing the color, body weight and size of body parts. The body size data were tabulated, averaged, and then analyzed descriptively; meanwhile, the plumage color data were calculated in frequency. To find the relation between size of body parts and body weight, data were analyzed using simple regression. The study found that the male Muscovy ducks had two plumage characteristics, consisting of white and black-white, both shared the same frequencies, while in the female Muscovy ducks, white color was more dominant compared to the black-white color. The colors of the beak were divided into two i.e., black with a white color in the middle and reddish-white with pink colors in the middle. The size of Lombok Muscovy ducks was rather small in comparison with the other Muscovy ducks. The size of male duck was larger than that of the female. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

Yeast exploration of local poultry gastrointestinal tract and its utilization as a probiotic candidate has not been widely studying. A total of 112 isolates of yeast were obtained from the digestive tract of Muscovy Duck, Javanesse Duck and Indonesian Native Chicken in the small intestine, cecum, and colon. Yeast with cellulolytic activity was quantitatively selected using CYG agar + 1% CMC medium with an incubation time of 30 ° C for 48 hours under anaerobic conditions. A total of 107 isolates of yeasts have cellulolytic activity. M41 yeast isolates of Mentok cecum possess highest clear zones cellulolytic activity (0.64 cm). M41 yeast characterization includes molecular identification, growth ability testing in CMC and glucose combination medium, CMCase activity, and viability test of probiotic ability with time variation. The results showed that yeast M41 had 98% proximity with Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on 26S sRNA gene sequence analysis, optimum growth on medium containing 1% CMC and 0.1% glucose (b / v), CMCase activity of 42.98 U / mL, and has a viability of 91.91; 66.22; 42.00; 42.00; 1.83 and 42.13 (%) respectively on bile salts 2 hours and 3 hours, gastric juice 45 minutes and 2 hours, pH 2 and pH 3 for 90 minutes. Based on results of the study, it was concluded that S. cerevisiae M41 potentially as a probiotic candidate for poultry with cellulolytic activity. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

The research side were located in Region of <1000 masl and ≥1000 m above sea level (asl) in west Java. Data were obtained from 133 small holder dairy farms included 336 dairy cows in normal lactation period. Parameters observed were agro-climate condition, feed consumption, milk production and milk quality, and sub-clinical mastitis prevalence. Result sowed that THI at <1000 m asl had a range of 76.1-76.7 leads to mild heat stress, while THI at ≥1000 m asl had a range of 66.2 - 66.8 which makes comfort environment to the dairy cow. Differences in feed consumption (P<0.01), milk production and quality (P<0.05) were found among two altitude study location. Milk production at ≥1000 m asl was 2.3 kg higher than at <1000 m asl. The udder health status was also different, a 51% of total sample at <1000 masl was detected sub-clinical mastitis (SCM) as high criteria, while 42% samples that were collected at ≥1000 m asl detected sub-clinical mastitis as middle criteria.

The materials used were 11 lambs aged 3-4 months, body weight (BW) 14.78 ± 1.99 kg (CV 3.98%), and 11 rams aged 10-12 months, BW 22.18 ± 1.81 kg (CV 3.29%). The study used a completely randomized design of 2x2 in nested patterns. There were two ages compared (lambs vs ram) and every age was nested the diet i.e. 100% Napier grass (G100) vs mixed pellet 50% grass and 50% concentrate (G50C50). The diet was given at 3.5% of BW. Parameters observed were dry matter intake (DMI) and digestibility, eating and ruminating time. The results showed that were no significant differences between lambs and rams in DMI (averaged 3.33% BW), digestibility (averaged 49.00%), eating (192.56 min/d), and ruminating (364 min/d). Animals given diet G50C50 had higher (P<0.05) DMI (666 vs 565 g/d), digestibility (50.49% vs 47.53%), and less (P<0.05) eating (47 vs 338 min/d) and ruminating (305 vs 423 min/d), as compared with those fed diet G100. It is concluded that the digestive tracts of lambs had developed and function to the stage similar to ram. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

The study used 500 female quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) aged 30 days with an average initial body weight of 94.75±4.17 gr. The quails were randomly allocated to five dietary treatments in a completely randomized design with 5 replicates of 20 quails. The dietary treatments were: Control = basal diet, Whole 4% = 96% basal diet + 4% whole HWM, Whole 8% = 92% basal diet + 8% whole HWM, Shell-less HWM 4% = 96% basal diet + 4% of shell-less HWM, Shell-less HWM 8% = 92% basal diet + 8% of shell-less HWM. The data were subjected to analysis of variance, when the treatments indicated significant effect it was continued with Duncan's Multiple Range Test. Quails fed HWM up to 8% improved (P<0.05) their crude fat retention, apparent metabolizable energy, calcium consumption and calcium retention (P<0.05). In addition, HWM in the ration increased the performance, and also yolk and albumen weight, but decreased (P<0.05) yolk and albumen index. It can be concluded that HWM improved performance and nutrient retention of quails. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

The study may be beneficial to emerge a new feed resource for local farm businesses. The hatchery wastes those comprised of 30% of egg shells, 60% of un-hatched eggs, and 10% of culled DOC were blended, and mixed with 10% of cassava cake meal(W/W), then mixed well with mineral adsorbent (bentonites or zeolites) at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5% (W/W). The mixture was conditioned at 80 ºC for 15 min, and extruded to make a pellet with 6 mm of diameter and 30 mm in length, and dried into warm air flow dryer. The moisture, crude protein (CP), ash, ether extract (EE), crude fiber (CF), apparent metabolizable energy (AME), true metabolizable energy (TME), metabolizability(MET) and nitrogen retention (NR) were observed in each pellet. Result of the experiment showed that moisture of pellet was decreased (P<0.05) by zeolites or bentonites addition. Even though the effect of binder mineral addition gave different patterns, concentrations of ash, crude protein, ether extract and crude fiber of pellet product were increased by increasing level of mineral adsorbent (P<0.05). Nutrient availability as was represented by AME, TME, MET, and NR were increased by zeolites and bentonites additions (P<0.05). In conclusion, supplementations of bentonites and zeolites in the hatchery waste based pellet could improve its proximate component concentration and nutrient availability. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

The growth traits were consisted of birth weight (BW), weaning weight (WW), yearling weight (YW), average daily gain of pre-weaning (ADG1) and post-weaning (ADG2). Data from 143 heads of SO cattle (year 2011 to 2016) which raised at PT KAR were used in this study. Generalized Linear Model (GLM) analysis was performed to evaluate non-genetic effect including sex, year of birth, generation and season. Therefore, to evaluate genetic parameters, the heritability (h2) and genetic correlation (rg) were performed using Paternal Halfshib Correlation method. The results showed that sex of calf had no significant effect (P&gt;0.05) on BW, WW and YW, but year of birth had significant effect on those traits. The factor of season had significant effect on WW. The estimation of h2 values of growth traits were included high category (h2&gt;0.30) and accurate (h2&gt;SE) on BW (0.66±0.42), WW (0.65±0.44), YW (0.67±0.42), ADG1 (0.68±0.45) and ADG2 (0.70±0.43). The estimation of rg values were included high category (rg&gt;0.50) and accurate (rg&gt;SE) on BW-WW (0.87±0.63); BW-YW (0.95±0.87); ADG1-WW (0.99±0.34); WW-YW (0.98±0.48) and ADG1-YW (0.95±0.51). It was concluded that trait of WW could be used as selection criteria to increase YW trait in SO cattle. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with 3 treatments and 4 replications. Treatments were control, rumen fermentation inoculated with L. plantarumU40and L. plantarumU40 + glucose solution. Population of L. plantarum U40 was higher at inoculation treatment. After 8 hours incubation, glucose addition tended to decrease L. plantarum U40 population. Control treatment showed lowest population of L. plantarum U40 along in vitro fermentation compared with other treatment. Inoculation of L. plantarumU40 significantly (p<0.05) increased population of LAB until 12 hours incubation compared with control. Control treatment had highest pH at all incubation time. Glucose addition significantly (P<0.05) decreased final rumen pH (24 hours) (6.30), compared with control treatment (6.85). Inoculation of L. plantarum U40 with glucose addition significantly (P<0.05)increased propionic acid, decreased acetic acid and A/P ratio compared with other treatments. Lactobacillus plantarum U40 without glucose addition did not affect propionic acid production significantly. As conclusion, Lactobacillus plantarum U40 can survive in rumen fluid and changes rumen fermentation when glucose is added as carbon source. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

Milk is food of animal that is rich in nutrients, but it is a perishable food easily contaminated by microorganisms. Contaminated pathogenic bacteria in milk can decrease the quality and has an organoleptic effect on milk, as well as endangers human health. Milk contaminated with bacteria antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in which is resistant to antibiotics, may adversely affect the response to treatment with antibiotics in humans when suffering from infectious diseases and using antibiotics in therapy. In this study Ettawa Grade's samples of fresh milk and other dairy products were taken from some of the goat farms in Yogyakarta Sleman district. The samples were tested for the presence of pathogenic bacteria and for its resistance to several kinds of antibiotics. In this study 35 Ettawa Grade's samples of fresh milk and other dairy products (fresh milk, milk powder, ice cream, and yoghurt) were taken from some of the goat farms in Sleman district-Yogyakarta. The samples were tested for the presence of pathogenic bacteria and for its resistance to several kinds of antibiotics. The result of the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in goat fresh milk and other dairy products was 15% Escherichia coli and had multi resistance to multiple antibiotics, namely ampicillin, colistin sulphate, cefixime, kanamycin, oxytetracycline, tetracycline and sulfonamide. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

Yeasts were collected from the gastrointestinal tract of Indonesian native chicken (Gallus javanicus), Javanese duck (Anas javanicus), and Muscovy duck (Anas moschata). The BSH assay was performed to determine secretion of BSH from yeast strain to conjugate bile salts into cholic acid-free by measuring precipitation zone in a specific medium. The quantitative measurement to assimilate cholesterol in yeast using CYG broth contained soluble cholesterol (500 ppm) and incubated at 30°C for 72 hours. Microplate reader used to analyze cholesterol content in the supernatant. Data were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with one way completely randomized. Precipitation zone found among isolates did not significantly different (P&gt;0.05). Isolate B-18 from Javanese duck performed the highest percentage of assimilating cholesterol with the value of 51.83% and identified as S. cerevisiae. This isolate was closely related to S. cerevisiae mt 21s (accession number X00149.1) based on phylogenetic tree analysis. It could be concluded that S. cerevisiae B-18 was potential for assimilating cholesterol in vitro. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

The study was conducted by using 200 heads of native chickens 10 days. The birds were divided into five experimental diets and each was divided into four replicate groups of ten birds per replicate. The based diet was formulated to contain 42% corn, rice bran 9%, fish meal 10%, fish oil 5%, soybean meal 9% and commercial diets 25%. Tomato meal was included in five experimental diets at levels of 0, 3, 6, 9, 12% to substitute based diets. The treatments were PO = 100% based diet (BD) + 0% tomato meal (TM); P1 = 97% BD+ 3% TM; P2 = 94% BD + 6% TM;P3 = 91% BD + 9% TM; P4 = 88% BD + 12% TM. Chemical composition of tomato meal was: 20.73% crude protein, 1.53% fat, 30.94%crude fiber, 0.98% Ca, 1.20% P and 2,416 kcal/kg of Gross Energy (GE). Results showedthat feeding tomato meal at an inclusion rate of 12% increased slaughter weight, carcass, breast meat, wings, drumstick and thigh, and decreased abdominal fat and blood cholesterol. Moreover, there were no significant difference in giblet (liver, heart and gizzard) between treatments. Meat water and meat crude protein were significantly increased. Meat crude fat and meat cholesterol were significantly decreased. In conclusion, tomato meal can be used as an alternative feedstuff in kampong chicken diets at inclusion levels up to 12% without negative effects on carcass quality and meat quality. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

The method use for research was survey method at Wirosari District and Purwodadi District, Grobogan Regency as research location. Each district was determined two villages to obtain data from respondent. Quota sampling method was use for determination the number of beef cattle farm household without a counting of population as a sampling frame. The number of respondent for each village was 20 farmers, so the total respondent was 80 farmers. Data were analyzed descriptively for on farm subsystem agribusiness approach, multiple linear regression and economic efficiency. The research result showed that the on-farm agribusiness subsystem was on moderate to good condition, the influencing factors of production were breed, forage, concentrate, health, reproduction, labor, year of farming and agribusiness implementation. The value of reproduction efficiency was 8.975 higher than 1, it was not efficient. The efficiency of farm scale, forage, concentrate, health and labor were 0.352; 0.128; 0.0148; 0.0235 and 0.0834 respectively less than 1, and it had not been efficient yet. The conclusion of research was the agribusiness implementation in beef cattle farming was in moderate and good criteria and gave the benefit to farmers. Production factors of farm scale, forage, concentrate, health, reproduction, labor, years of farming and agribusiness implementation were influence to the beef cattle production. The efficiency of farm scale, forage, concentrate, health, and labor on the beef cattle farm were not been efficient yet, while reproduction became an inefficient production factor. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

One hundred-sixty eight female broiler chickens aged 15 days were distributed into 7 groups as follows: 1) broilers were fed a diet with no medicinal herb as the control (P0) 2) broilers were fed a diet with 5% Sauropus androgynus leaf powder (P1); 3) broilers were fed a diet with 5% bay leaf powder (P2); 4) broilers were fed a diet with 5% basil leaf powder (P3) 5) broilers were fed a diet with 5% papaya leaf powder (P4); 6) broilers were fed a diet with 5% Moringa leaf powder (P5) and; 7) broilers were fed a diet with 5% noni fruit powder. Experimental results showed that the inclusion of medicinal herbs significantly increased protein (P<0.01), iron (P<0.05), kalium, calcium, phosphorus, linolenic acid (P<0.01), methionine, omega 3 unsaturated fatty acid (P<0.05), but significantly reduced fat (P<0.01), glutamic acid, alanine, lignoceric acid, oleci acid (P<0.01) and omega 9 unsaturated fatty acid (P<0.05). It was concluded that Sauropus androgynus leaf was the most effective to produce low fat-high protein and mineral meats. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

One hundred and ninety two female magelang ducks were assigned into a completely randomized design with a 4×4 factorial arrangement and each experimental unit was repeated 3 times, each with 4 female magelang ducks. The first factor was dose of curcumin supplementation consisted of 4 levels i .e., 0, 9, 18, and 36 mg/duck/day. The second factor was the color of monochromatic light consisted of 4 levels i.e., white, red, green, and blue colors. The data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. The result showed that serum concentrations of triglyceride, cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), and low density lipoprotein (LDL) were lower (P<0.05) while high density lipoprotein (HDL) were higher (P<0.05) in experimental ducks supplemented with a curcumin dose of 36 mg/duck/day in variety of monochromatic light colors compared to control experimental ducks without curcumin supplementation. The curcumin doses of 18 or 36 mg/duck/day within red, green, or blue light had the potential to modulate lipid metabolism, as indicated by the increased serum concentration of HDL and the decreased serum concentrations of triglyceride, cholesterol, VLDL, and LDL of the experimental female magelang ducks. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

Samples of limestone were obtained from two limestone mountains, Pamotan Subdistrict of Central Java Province and Wonosari Subdistrict of Yogyakarta Province. The mixtures were created by combining urea at levels 25, 50, 75and 100%; respectively with two limestones on the basis of their Ca contents: L0U100, LP25U75, LP50U50; LP75U25, LW25U75; LW50U50; and LW75U25. The soluble fraction, potentially degradable fraction, the degradation rate of potentially degradable fraction, and effective degradation of respective dry matter (DM) and nitrogen (N) ruminal degradation kinetics were measured in each mixture. The mixture of LP75U25 had lowest effective and degradation rate of potentially degradable fraction (P<0.05) respectively for DM and N compared with those of other mixtures.

The aim of this study was to identify the association of SNP and mRNA expression of SLC23A3 as a candidate marker for fatty acid traits (FAs). Sixty two F2 Kampung × Broilers crossbred chickens population were used in this study. FA composition was measured at 12 weeks of age from thigh meat of crossbred chicken. The PCR-RFLP and qRT-PCR were used for association study and expression analysis of SLC23A3 gene with divergent fatty acid composition. A SNP in coding region c.22385690 A>C of the SLC23A3 gene was associated (P<0.05) with fatty acid composition including stearic acid (C18:0), elaidic acid (C18:1n9t), and linoleic acid (C18:2n6c). The SLC23A3 was detected in liver from high fatty acids (HFA) and low fatty acid (LFA) composition. However, gene expression of SLC23A3 were not differentially expressed between HFA and LFA. These results will explain better understanding of the key important role of the SLC23A3 in fatty acid traits within the liver and will propose SLC23A3 as a potential genomic selection for selection of chickens with fatty acid composition. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

Saanen goat has predominance in milk production traits. Milk fat content is one of the commercial traits of milk production. Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase1 (DGAT1) gene was involved in the final process of triglyceride synthesis and associated with milk fat content. Single nucleotide subtitution or insertion-deletion in certain sequence of DGAT1 gene could be gene markers for milk fat content. The objective of this study was to identify differences variation in milk fat content among individual Saanen goats, to identify exon 14-16 polymorphism of DGAT1 gene and to examine its correlation between polymorphism and milk fat content on Saanen goats. The methodologies was collection blood and milk samples, DNA isolation from blood, amplification of DGAT1 genes, sequencing, detection of polymorphism of exon 14-16 DGAT1 gene with Polymerase Chain Reaction-Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), and examination milk quality on three lactation months using Lactoscan. The average of daily milk production from 70 Saanen goat was 2340±709 mL, 1880±632 mL, 1432±536 mL and average of milk fat content was 3.07±0.52%, 2.53±0.55%, 3.00±0.55% for the first, second and third months of lactation, respectively. The amplicon size of exon 14-16 of DGAT1 gene was ± 350 bp and showed monomorphic pattern from PCR-SSCP.

Total of 192 broiler, with initial body weight was 481.0 ± 67.2 g, given dietary treatment starting on day 21 until day 42. The experiment was assigned in a completely randomized design with 8 treatments and 4 replications. Dietary treatment were 21% intact protein (T0), 18% intact protein (T1), 21% microparticle protein (T2), 18% microparticle protein (T3), T0+Lactobacillus sp.1.2 mL (T4), T1+Lactobacillus sp.1.2 mL (T5), T2+Lactobacillus sp.1.2 mL (T6), T3+Lactobacillus sp.1.2 mL (T7). Parameters measured were total ileal lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Coliform and pH, rate of passage, daily body weight gain (DWG) and also carcass weight. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and followed by Duncan multiple range test (P<0.05). Experimental results showed that microparticle protein diet added with Lactobacillus sp. (P<0.05) increased total LAB and DWG, but decreased Coliform population, and slowed down the rate of passage. However, carcass weight was not significantly affected by treatments. Feeding microparticle protein (18%) with addition of Lactobacillus sp. (1.2 mL) can improve to be better condition of digestive tract based on higher LAB and lower Coliform populations, and increase daily body weight gain with the same carcass weight. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

Higher digestibility of feed material means the total amount of feed content that can be digested in the digestive tract. This study aimed to obtain the proportion of the use of fermentation concentrate in rumen fermentation based on in vitro. The feed used consisted of 7 treatments as follows P1 (20% Pennisetum purpureum: 80% concentrate), P2 (30% P.purpureum : 70% concentrate), P3 (40% P.purpureum : 60% concentrate), P4 (50% P.purpureum : 50% concentrate), P5 (20% concentrate: 80% P.purpureum), P6 (30% concentrate: 70% P.purpureum) and P7 (40% concentrate: 60% P.purpureum). Dry matter digestibility (DMD) and organic matter digestibility (OMD) were done using Theodorou method. Gas production was measured when the samples were incubated at 39oC in the waterbath incubator at hours 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, and 48. Approximately 0.75 g of feed formulation was mixed with 75 mL of rumen fluid buffer. The rumen fluid is taken from 3 fistulated cattles prior to morning feeding. A complete randomized design with three replicates was used. Asymptotic gas production and kinetics were estimated by the Orskov’s model. The results of this study showed that P2 and P3 treatment showed the best digestibility among others treatment with 71.63%; 71.06% of DMD and 76.42%; 71.65% of OMD.

Brahman cross steers reared under intensive production system in feedlot for 87 days. Samples of meat, spleen and liver were collected from 16 steers aged 24-36 months with four types of feeding treatment, feeding without Se (group I) and feeding with additional supplementary of 0.3 ppm selenium for 25, 50 and 75 days (group II, III and IV, respectively). Samples characterization were carried out by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) using irradiation facility in G.A Siwabessy Serpong reactor. Analysis results showed that there is an increasing of selenium content in meat and liver after 75 days feeding. The mean of selenium in liver for group I, II, III and IV were 0.13, 0.17, 0.20 and 0.31 mg/kg wet weight, respectively, while for liver were 0.43, 0.53, 0.60 and 0.70 mg/kg wet weight, respectively. The mean concentrations for iron in meat, spleen and liver were 11.85, 139, and 38.94 mg/kg, respectively, for zinc were 27.90, 21.70 and 25.27 mg/kg, respectively. In this study, the meat and liver contribute more than 100% of recommended daily allowance (RDA) of Se for children and adults. Spleen have contribution of RDA of Fe 53 to 154%, while the RDA of Zn is contributed mostly from meat by 21 to 56%. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

The research was conducted from July to December 2016, using survey method with multistage random sampling technique. The selected locations were three Districts of Sonder, Tombulu and Kakas based on the largest population of pigs involving randomly one hundred respondents. The variables were included profit, prices of corn, concentrate, bran, medicine, vitamin, animal housing depreciation, the number of piglets, farm experience and output sales orientation. Data were analyzed on the basis of unit output price Cobb-Douglas Profit Function using multiple linear regressions. Research showed that input prices of production factor and number of piglets were influenced profit (P<0.01). Partially, the input prices of corn, concentrate, bran, medicine, vitamins, output sales orientation, and the number of piglets influenced profit (P<0.01). Average profits of farm were IDR 942,823.70/month for breeding models and IDR 3,679,833.85/month for combination of breeding-fattening models, with average numbers of sows were 2.25 heads. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

This stage increases the sensitivity of collagen molecule chains that can affect production yields and collagen properties. The objectives of the study were to synthesize and evaluate halal collagen from Bali cattle’s hide on different -extracting processes. A total of 5 treatments applied in this study, namely: T1 = Ca(OH)2 5% (b/v); T2 = Ca(OH)2 15% (b/v); T3 = Ca(OH)2 5% + CH3COOH 5%(b/v); T4 = Ca(OH)2 15% + CH3COOH 5% (b/v). Each treatment was repeated 4 times. Data were analyzed in a variety of ways using SPSS program. The observed parameters consisted of: 1) yield, 2) viscosity and 3) pH. The results showed that the difference in real pre-extracting process increased the yield and viscosity, but not the pH value. The application of T4 treatment provided the best results compared to other treatments as well as controls to increase the yield and also improve the collagen's physical properties and pH. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

The research used 4x2 factorial complete randomized design, the first factor was dose-administration duration and the second factor was cessation length of pegagan extract. Parameters consisted of degree of spermatogenesis, sperm quality (motility, concentration and abnormality), and testosterone level. The data were processed using analysis of variance and Duncan’s test. Results showed that there was no interaction between dose-administration duration and cessation length. There was no significant difference of dose-administration duration of pegagan on degrees of spermatogenesis, sperm motility and testosterone level. Cessation length did not significantly affect degrees of spermatogenesis, sperm motility, and testosterone level although these results indicated that cessation of pegagan extract for 12 days increased degrees of spermatogenesis and sperm motility, indicated the antifertility potency of pegagan extract. In conclusion, Pegagan extract has potency as anti-fertility agent although the degree of spermatogenesis, sperm quality and testosterone levels were still in the normal range for the reproductive process and not irreversible, and pegagan could be explored as an reversible anti-fertility agent. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

The research was conducted at cows of the Ukrainian Black-Spotted (UBS) dairy breed and crossbred cows of the first-generation obtained as a result of crossing with Brown Swiss breed and at cows of the Ukrainian Red-Spotted (URS) dairy breed and crossbred cows of the first-generation obtained by crossing of the URS dairy breed with Montbeliarde breed. In both farms there were two groups of pure-breed and crossbred cows-analogues. The mineral composition of milk and its technological properties in crossbred cows were higher compared to the pure-breed analogues. The fat content of milk crossbred cows exceeded by 0.08-0.16%, protein exceeded by 0.15-0.22%, and the main trace elements include Ca and P – by 2.66-8.83 and 2.12-7.81 mg/100 g of milk, respectively. Milk protein of crossbred cows was marked by a more balanced composition of essential amino acids (EAAs) and their ratio suitable for processing. The amount of EAAs in 100 g of milk protein of crossbred cows was 3.11-6.25% higher compared to local analogues. Crossbred cows dominated pure-breed analogues by the mineral composition of milk. The authors recommend the use of Montbeliarde or Brown Swiss breeds in commercial herds to improve the technological properties of milk. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

Cheese was manufactured from goat milk with addition of probiotics bacteria L.plantarum TW14 and L.rhamnosus TW2 with a ratio of (1:1/v/v). Treatments were arranged in a factorial design, employing two factors, i.e. temperature (cold; frozen) and storage time (0; 15,30,45 and 60 days). Each treatment was repeated three times. Results showed that goat cheese stored at cold temperature has an average hardness-texture of 374.46 ±77.69 gf while that of the cheese stored at frozen temperature has 221.66 ±38.46 gf, which were significantly different (P<0.05). In term of flavor, texture and overall acceptability, there were no significant effects (P>0.05) of storage temperatures and storage time. However, the taste of cheese stored under cold and frozen temperatures was highly significant different (P<0.01). Fatty acids composition of cheese stored for 60 days in a cold storage showed that the highest fatty acid content was SFA which was 64.34% and USFA was 16.76%. During the 60-day storage, the SFA percentage of was relatively stable while the percentage of oleic acid USFA increased. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

This study was conducted to identify the KLF3 gene polymorphism in the Indonesian FH cattle. A total of 302 individual cattle blood samples from West Java (n=138), Central Java (n=34), and East Java (n=130) provincies were used to obtain DNA samples. The DNA sequencing was performed using 9 samples (each location of sampling represented by 3 samples) for initial identification of the KLF3 gene polymorphism and followed by PCR-RFLP analysis using all DNA samples. There were two SNPs identified in the intron region of the KLF3 gene i.e. SNP g.59607486delC and SNP g.59607554A>G. The SNP g.59607554A>G could be detected using PCR-RFLP method with HpyCH4IV restriction enzyme and resulted three genotypes of the KLF3 gene (AA, AG, and GG) but its heterozygosity value was low in the Indonesian FH cattle. The AA genotype has the highest frequency (0.73), while the AG and GG genotypes frequency were 0.24 and 0.03, respectively. Information about the KLF3 gene polymorphism in this study can be considered for further study to analyse its association with milk and protein yield traits. © 2018 Diponegoro University.

Willd. leaves in the diet on feed intake, digestibility and body weight gain of Kacang goats. The completely randomized block design using 5 treatments and 5 replications was used in this experiment. The treatments were 5 concentrate feeds containing different levels of white kabesak leaves i.e. 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40% in the dry matter (DM) basis (representing T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4 treatments, respectively). The feeds were set up to contain 11.5-12.5% of crude protein (CP). Concentrate feed and native grass was fed at ratio of 60 : 40 was fed to 5 local male goats (age 1-1.5 years old and initial weight of 16.7±5.0 kg). The results showed that DM, organic matter (OM), and CP intake of T0 was not significantly different from those of T1 goats, but it was significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) than those of T2, T3 and T4. The DM, OM, CP, and crude fiber (CF) digestibility as well as body weight gain in T2 goats were significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) and had feed conversion ratio that was significantly better (P&lt;0.05) compared to those of the other feed treatments. In conclusion, the most optimum level of white kabesak (Acacia leucophloea Roxb.)

Kappa-casein gene influences the manufacturing of milk properties. The aim of this study was to identify the kappa-casein gene polymorphism in Friesian Holstein (FH) cattle. Fifty nine (59) samples consisted of 32 (Malang), 10 (Sukahati Bogor) and 17 (Research Center for Biotechnology-Indonesian Institute of Sciences's collections) were applied in this study. DNA samples were extracted by high concentrated NaCl and quantified by spectrophotometer. The kappa-casein gene was amplified at 379 bp fragment by PCR method using a pair primer of kappa-casein at 56°C annealing for 30 cycles. PCR-RFLP technique with HindIII was used for genotyping analysis. The result showed that there were three variants of genotypes (AA, AB and BB) in two populations from Malang and RC for Biotechnology-LIPI's collection while cattle from Sukahati had only AA and AB genotypes. The averages of genotype frequencies were 65.28%; 65.28%; and 3.00% for AA, AB and BB genotypes respectively while frequencies of 0.81 and 0.19 were for A and B alleles, respectively. FH cattle populations were in equilibrium genetics. This finding concludes that polymorphism was found in three of FH populations with A allele was more common in kappa-casein locus. B allele is known having association with milk production, milk component and cheese yield. Increasing of B allele would influence on milk performance of FH cattle. Explorations of quantitative, qualitative and molecular genetics are important to improve dairy cattle performance.","Dairy cattle; Friesian Holstein; Kappa casein gene; Polymorphism",,,,,,"079.01.2.450083/2016","The research was supported by DIPA-LIPI research grant (079.01.2.450083/2016).

A total of 120 broilers were used for the research. The experiment utilized a completely randomized design in 2 x 3 factorial arrangement of treatments consisting of two dietary concentrations of energy and three dietary concentrations of crude fiber. Each treatment consisted of 4 replications (5 birds each) was reared during 35 days. The birds were housed in battery cages with ad libitum access to feed and water. During the experiment, feed intake, carcass yield, abdominal fat, blood LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol were measured. Data were subjected to the analysis of variance test followed by least significant difference test (LSD). Results showed that the diet with 3,100 Kcal/kg ME and 11% crude fiber significantly decreased feed intake, abdominal fat percentage, and blood LDL-cholesterol, but did not affect final body weight and the value of blood HDL-cholesterol and had the good value of carcass percentage. The diets containing sawdust with higher level of energy content decreased feed intake and the higher level of crude fiber decreased final body weight, carcass percentage and abdominal fat. Optimum broiler performance and carcass quality was obtained by diet formulated to contain 3100 Kcal/kg ME and 11% crude fiber.","Broiler; Carcass; Crude fiber; Energy; Sawdust",,,,,,,,"Abo Omar, J.M., Carcass composition and visceral organ mass ofbroiler chicks fed different levels of olive pulp (2005) J.

Three kinds of environmental pens were designed in this experiment: comfortable environment pens with temperature of air conditioner adjusted at 22°C (R0), tropical environment pens (±30°C ) without organic Se (R1), and tropical environment pens supplemented with 0.30 ppm organic Se (R2). One hundred and twenty broiler chickens (unisex) were used in this study. There were 40 chicks per pen for each treatment. The experimental design was completely randomized with four replications for each treatment. The data were statistically analyzed using the general linear model of SAS program. Results showed that R0 and R2 groups had significantly increased (P<0.05) feed intake, body weight, body weight gain, and decreased feed conversion ratio compared to R1 groups. Meanwhile, the expression of HSP70, GSH-Px enzyme activity and MDA of R2 groups and R0 groups were significantly lower (P<0.05) than that of R1 groups. It was concluded that the broilers given 0.30 ppm organic Se in tropical environment had similar productivity and expression of HSP 70 with broilers kept in comfortable environment.","Broiler; HSP70 gene; Organic selenium; Productivity; Tropical environment",,,,,,"238/IT3.41.2/L2/SPK/2013","The authors would like to thank the Directorate General of Higher Education of Indonesia for Beasiswa Unggulan (superior scholarship) and supporting this research through Funding Research Program-BOPTN (Project ID No.238/IT3.41.2/L2/SPK/2013).","Al-Aqil, A., Zulkifli, I., Changes in heat shock protein 70 expression and blood characteristics in transported broiler chickens as affected by housing and early age feed restriction (2009) Poult.

The experiment used fifteen ewes of 1.5 years old, primiparous, caged individually with their lambs and conducted three treatments and five replications from a completely randomized designed. Those treatments included R1= ration with 0% sunflower oil addition, R2= ration with 4% sunflower oil addition, R3= ration with 6% sunflower oil addition. The variables consisted of dry matter intake, nutrients, ewes performances (birth weight, weaning weight, decreased of body weight), total and partial VFA, the ratio of acetate: propionate, methane production, protozoa and bacterial population. Data were analyzed statistically and descriptively. The results showed that the treatments did not influence dry matter intake and nutrients,. rumen fermentability and ewes performances. Although the treatments increased (P<0.01) fat consumption and reduced shrinkage of body weight. It can be concluded that the adding sunflower oil as the resource of unsaturated fatty acids up to 6% of the ration was not negatively affected the fermentability of rumen, moreover can improve ewes body condition and, accelerated body weight recovery.","Body weight recovery; Garut ewes; Rumen fermentability; Sunflower oil; Unsaturated fatty acids",,,,,,,,"Adiati, U., Subandriyo, Produktivitas ternak domba Garut pada stasiun percobaan Cilebut Bogor (2007) Prosiding, , Seminar Nasional Teknologi Peternakan dan Veteriner P436-440; Al-Sabbagh, T.A., Swanson, L.V., Thomson, J.M., The effect of ewe body condition at lambing on colostral immunoglobulin G concentration and lamb performance (1995) J.

A total of 49 swine consist 15 boars and 34 gilts, with average body weight of 18.50-21.50 kg were used in this research. All of samples were raised in the same pen and feeding management. This research used the experimental method of Completely Randomized Design involving three treatments of animal breeds including Landrace, Yorkshire, and Duroc breeds. The data were analyzed by using analysis of covariance procedur General Linier Model and Least Square Means test. Boars and gilts were analyzed in separated data. The result showed that the effect of breed was significantly associated for all traits, but not for boars feed intake. The overall, Yorkshire and Landrace performed better than Duroc for average daily gain, feed conversion ratio, selection index, and age at 90 kg body weight.

Setiap perlakuan dilakukan empat kali ulangan. Fermentasi dilakukan menggunakan Hohenheim Gas Test (HGT) pada suhu 39oC selama 72 jam. Pada akhir fermentasi dilakukan pengukuran gas metan, parameter fermentasi, aktivitas mikrobia, kecernaan nutrient dan profil asam lemak cairan rumen. Data dianalisa menggunakan rancangan acak lengkap dan dilanjutkan dengan Duncan test (DMRT) untuk perbedaan rataan. Hasil penelitian menunjukan bahwa produksi metan mengalami penurunan sekitar 13,74%-17,39 % ketika pakan diberi ampas kelapa sebanyak 15-20%. Dari hasil penelitian disimpulkan bahwa pemberian ampas kelapa 15- 20% dalam pakan ruminansia dapat mereduksi gas metan serta tidak mengganggu aktivitas mikrobia pada fermentasi cairan rumen secara in vitro. Supplementasi ampas kelapa tersebut dapat dijadikan acuan dalam mendesain pakan penghambat metanogenik.","Ampas kelapa; Fermentasi rumen; Gas tes; Kata kunci: metan; Parameter fermentasi",,,,,,"Universitas Gadjah Mada","The appreciation and gratitude are conveyed to the Directorate General of Higher Education who has provided funding for fundamental research in 2016, thanks to the Dean and head of Laboratory of Biochemistry of Faculty of Animal Science Universitas Gadjah Mada who have given the opportunity to conduct research.","Chaney, A.L., Marbach, E.P., Modified reagents for determination of urea and ammonia (1962) Clin.

The aim of the study was to find out the pathogenicity of H5N1 HPAI virus clade 2.3.2 in Indonesian indigenous chickens. The study showed that within twenty four hours rearing, the chickens were exhibited mild clinical signs and by 48 hours, all of the chickens died, whereas the ducks survived but with severe clinical signs. The H5N1 HPAI virus has been successfully isolated from chickens and ducks swabs, confirming that those animals were infected by the virus. Histologically, the infected chicken encountered with severe inflammation reaction namely non suppuratives encephalitis, tracheitis, myocarditis, interstitial pneumonia, hepatitis, proventriculitis, enteritis, pancreatitis, nephritis and bursitis. Necrotizing spleen and pancreas were also prominent. Viral antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry staining in various affected visceral organs. This suggests that Indonesian indigenous chickens were susceptible to H5N1 HPAI virus clade 2.3.2 and it can be transmitted easily to Indonesian indigenous chickens by contact transmission with infected ducks.","H5N1 HPAI virus clade 2.3.2; Indonesian indigenous chickens; Pathogenicity",,,,,,,,"Bingham, J., Green, D.J., Lowther, S., Klippel, J., Burggraaf, S., Anderson, D.E., Wibawa, H., Daniels, P.W., Infection studies with two highly pathogenic avian influenza strains (Vietnamese and Indonesian) in pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), with particular reference to clinical disease, tissue tropism and viral shedding (2009) Avian Pathol., 38, pp. 267-278; Bröjer, C., Agren, E.O., Uhlhorn, H., Bernodt, K., Mörner, T., Jansson, D.S., Mattsson, R., Gavier-Widén, D., Pathology of natural highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 infection in wild tufted ducks (Aythya fuligula) (2009) J.

The Number of samples were 81 heads of Bali cattle consist of bulls (62 heads) and cows (19 heads) with various age ranging from 1 to 6 years were collected their body weight and carcass qualities including backfat thickness (BF), longissmus dorsi thickness (LD), rump fat thickness (RF), rump thickness (RT), marbling score (MS) and the percentage of intramuscular fat (PIF). Those were estimated using ultrasound performed on 4.5-6,5 MHz frequency with depth of 8.8-13 cm. The BF, LD, MS and PIF measurement were applied on 12th-13th ribs, while the RT and RF measurement were conducted between ischium and illium. MS determination was calculated using Aus-Meat standard, while PIF was analysis based on Deaton and Rouse (2000). Body weight and carcass quality among traits were analyzed using descriptive and correlation procedures. The results showed that performance of body weight and carcass quality differs between Bali bulls and Bali cows, as well as among the age variations. Correlation analyses among traits (body weight and carcass quality) showed strong positive correlation (P&lt;0.05) ranging from 0.291 to 0.938. In conclusion, ultrasound imaging method could be used to estimate carcass quality characteristics in Bali cattle.","Bali cattle; Carcass quality; Ultrasound imaging",,,,,,,,"Albertí, P., Ripoll, G., Goyache, F., Lahoz, F., Olleta, J.L., Panea, B., Sañudo, C., Carcass characterization of seven Spanish beef breeds slaughtered at two commercialweights (2005) Meat Sci., 71, pp. 514-521; Albrecht, E., Teuscher, F., Ender, K., Wegner, J., Growth-and breed-related changes of marbling characteristics in cattle (2006) J.

The use of antibiotic can be replaced by MOS to reduce the number of pathogenic bacteria in small intestines of chickens. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of MOS extracted from copra meal on intestinal microbial population and blood profile of broiler chickens. The study was conducted by using 150 day-old male broiler chickens (average body weight 46.00 ± 1.41 g). The design of this experiment was a completely randomized design (CRD) with 3 dietary treatments, 5 replications and 10 birds in each replication. The dietary treatments consisted of control diet (corn-soybean meal diet without supplementation of antibiotic and prebiotic), control + 0.1% antibiotic bambermycin, and control + 0.035% MOS. For the first 4 weeks the birds were fed treatment diets, followed by commercial feed for 2 weeks. The parameters observed in this study were intestinal microbes population and blood profiles. The results showed that the administration of 0,035% MOS increased the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) number compared with antibiotics feed (P<0.05), but not significantly different (P >0.05) with the control group. The total aerobic and coliform bacteria were higher in MOS and antibiotic treatment compared than control group. The supplementation of 0.035% MOS from copra meal in diet increased the level of leucocytes which is important to immune response of broilers and its usage was safe because the level of chicken blood profile were within the normal range.","Escherichia coli; LAB; Mannanase; Prebiotic; Streptomyces sp.

Six month old of male JTT sheep and paddock with field grass vegetation were used in the research. Fifteen male JTT sheeps were divided into three groups consisting of 5 heads per group, and grazing for 2 month (in early rainy season, late rainy season and dry season, respectively). The measured variables were feed consumption, digested organic matter, mineral (calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, copper, zinc) level in forage, feces, blood, and daily body weight gain. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance with one-way classification. Magnesium and zinc status of JTT sheep were adequate, whereas phosphorus status was deficient in all season. Calcium in early and late rainy season were deficient (7.37 and 7.86 mg/100 mL, respectively), whereas in the dry season was adequate (8.70 mg/100 mL). The copper deficiency was found in dry and late rainy season (with the Serum copper level was 0.62 and 0.51 μg/mL, respectively, and borderline in early rainy season (64.7 μg/mL). Serum copper in the late rainy season was lower (P<0.05) than it in early rainy season and dry season.

The research was carried out by survey method. The research locations (Boyolali and Semarang) were chosen using purposive sampling method. In each regency was determined 2 sub district locations in which having the largest dairy cow population and 3 Dairy Cattle Farmer Associations (DCFA) in every sub district. Dairy farmers were sampled randomly, 10 farmers in every DCFA. Therefore, there were 120 dairy cattle farmers for sample. Data were analyzed using descriptive methods, location quotient (LQ) analysis and multiple linear regression statistical model. The dependent variables were yield and quality of milk (Y1,2) and the independent variables were human resources (x1), environmental resources (x2), capital resources (x3), entrepreneurship resources (x4), technology resources (x5), institution resources (x6) and infrastructure resources (x7). The LQ analysis showed that dairy cattle population, availability of forage and agricultural waste, and absorption of labour were very potential (LQ>1). Local resources significantly affected (P<0.01) the production and quality of dairy cattle milk. These results suggest that the development of dairy cattle business needs to consider the potential of local resources in order toimprove the production and quality of milk.","Dairy cattle; Local resources; Milk production; Milk quality",,,,,,,,"(2014) Statistik Peternakan Tahun 2014, Ungaran-Jawa Tengah, , Dinas Peternakan dan Kesehatan Hewan Propinsi Jawa Tengah; Ekou, J., Dairy production and marketing in Uganda : Current status, constraint and way forward (2014) African J.

The bacterial isolation used a sample of liquid and solid waste from leather waste which taken from a different waste reservoirs (three liquid waste and one solid waste in unhairing phase). Data of the isolated bacteria, OD 600 nm bacterial growth, the identification of bacteria, and enzyme precipitation with 60% ammonium sulfate were analyzed descriptively. The colony diameter, diameter of clear zone, proteolytic index, and enzymatic activities characterization on difference of pH and temperature were analyzed using Completely Randomized Design, followed by Duncan's New Multiple Range Test. The second sample from four samples of the isolated bacteria was tested further for their proteolytic activity. The morphology of the colony was circle, white, flat ledges and convex elevation, the basal cell morphology was red, gram-negative, non-motile, catalase positive and gelatin negative. The highest activity of enzyme on pH 11 with activity unit enzyme 45,18±1,77 U/ml and specific enzyme activity 43,19±1,69 U/mg and temperature of 40°C activity unit enzyme 54,02±1,89 U/ml and specific enzyme activity 51,65±1,8 U/mg.

Variables observed were total gas production, in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), organic matter (IVDOM), and crude protein (IVDCP), volatile fatty acid (VFA) profiles and NH3 concentration. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results showed that there was no significant effect of R3 on IVDMD, IVDOM and IVDCP as compared to R1 and R2. However, there was significant difference (P<0.05) of the parameters between R1 and R2 (P<0.05). There was no significant effect (P<0.05) of different Indigofera levels on total gas production. The partial VFA of each concentrate feeds was not significantly different, but the percentage of acetic acids of concentrates containing I. zollingeriana were higher than those of control (P<0.05). The concentration of rumen NH3 of R2 was lower than R1 and R3 (P<0.05) even though the IVCPD of R2 was higher than R1.

The materials used were 84 male Muscovy ducks at 9 weeks old. The research used completely randomized design with 7 treatments. The treatments were E0C0 : basal diet without α-tocopherol and ascobic acids, E400: basal diet+ α-tocopherol 400IU, E600: basal diet+α-tocopherol 600IU, C400: basal diet+ascorbic acid 400mg/kg, C600: basal diet+ascorbic acid 600mg/kg, E200C200: basal diet+α-tocopherol 200IU+ ascorbic acid 200mg/kg, and E300C300: basal diet+α-tocopherol 300IU+ ascorbic acid 300mg/kg. Each treatment was repeated 4 times and each replication consisted of 3 ducks. The observed variables were body weight, feed consumption, feed conversion ratio, packed cell volume (PCV), total of plasma protein (TPP), leucocyte count, basophil, heterophil, eosinophil, monocyte, lymphocytes count and heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio of Muscovy duck. The result indicated that E0C0, E400, E600, C400, C600, E200C200 and E300C300 had no significant difference in body weight, feed intake and feed conversion. There were significant effects on PCV, leucocyte count, percentage of heterophil and lymphocytes, but had no significant effect on eosinophil, monocyte and the H/L ratio. The C400 resulted a higher PCV count, percentage of heterophil, and H/L ratio. The C 600 produced the highest leucocyte count.

Three medium scale dairy goat farms located in Bogor Regency which has population of more than 100 heads and has established more than 10 years were purposively selected for the study. Data were collected during February to May 2014. The design of this study was based on descriptive qualitative approach (rapid appraisal approach). Data were analized using internal factors evaluation (IFE) and external factors evaluation (EFE), strategic position and action evaluation (SPACE) matrix, and grand strategy matrix. It was revealed that dairy goat farms in Bogor Regency were located in quadrant I in SPACE matrix, which was on the aggressive strategy. Dairy goat farms have many resource advantages, despite facing various threats. The Grand Strategy Matrix analysis showed that dairy goat farms were in quadrant I. Dairy goat farms were in an excellent position to take advantage of the opportunities, overcome internal weaknesses and avoiding multiple external threats. The best strategies to be selected for dairy goat farms were market penetration and product development.","Dairy goat; Development strategy; External Factor; Grand Strategy Matrix; Internal Factor; SPACE Matrix",,,,,,,,"Aisyah, S.A., Sanim, B., Maulana, A., Strategi pengembangan usaha sapi potong: Studi kasus CV Mitra Tani Farm (2013) J.

A total of 180 twenty four wk-old laying ducks were fed with two forms (sun-dried and ground-fresh) and three levels of SSF (10, 20 and 30%) from 24 to 32 wk of age. Experimental diets were formulated containing 105.1; 141.5 and 177.9 g/kg crude protein and 3078; 3065 and 3052 kcal metabolizable energy (ME) /kg diet. Production performance and egg quality were measured. The form of SSF had a significant effect (P<0.0001) on feed intake, egg production, feed conversion, egg mass and egg number except final body weight. No significant effects (P>0.05) were found on all of the performance parameters measured due to feeding levels of SSF except feed intake and final body weight. The interaction of form and feeding level was significant (P<0.05) on egg and body weights. Low performance and egg quality were observed in the birds fed a diet containing the dried SSF. It can be suggested that local ducks required 20% SSF as a single protein source for maximum egg production (41.2%) and total egg number per wk (3.1 eggs/bird/wk) during 8 wk of rearing period. Egg quality can be improved by feeding the fresh SSF. However, due to be sufficiently better processing technique, the dried SSF would be potential to replace the common fish for laying ducks.","Egg production and quality; Mojosari duck; Sapu-sapu fish",,,,,,,,"Akintola, S.L., Brown, A., Bakare, A., Osowo, O.D., Bello, B.O., Effects of hot smoking and sun drying processes on nutritional composition of giant tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon, Fabrisius, 1798) (2013) Pol.

Eggs production was recorded during three weeks period. About 300 eggs were selected from each treatment to be hatched. Fertility was observed at 4th days of hatching process using egg candler. Data of eggs production, eggs weight, fertility, and hatchability were analyzed using unpaired two sample Student's t-test. The results showed that average of egg weight, fertility and hatchability were not different under two management system, but egg production in the semi-intensive maintenance was significantly higher (P<0.05) than those in the extensive system. Egg production in the semi-intensive was 12.3% higher than those in the extensive. In conclusion, the semi-intensive system that is applied in this study the number of eggs production but did not affect the average of egg weight, fertility and hatchability.","Egg production; Extensive system; Hatchability; Local duck; Semi intensive system",,,,,,,,"Adzitey, F., Adzitey, S.P., Duck production: Has a potential to reduce poverty among rural households in Asian communities-A Review (2011) J.

A nested design was used in this study with experimental material was Magelang duck consisted of 8 male (treatments), 40 female (sub-treatments) and 360 offspring (replicates) and the observed parameter was productive characteristics. Nine DOD from each female were measured for hatching weight and growth up to 8 weeks old. The measured Hen Day Production (HDP) at initial laying for within days. Result showed that different selection intensities (25, 50 and 75%) led to response in 2.968; 1.870 and 0.982 g hatching weight; respectively; 0.00221, 0.00139 and 0.00073 g growth, respectively; and 1.728, 1.088 and 0.571% egg production, respectively. Selection accuracy for hatching weight, growth and egg production was 0.70, 0.76 and 0.51, respectively. Conclusively, the less preserved female proportion, the higher selection intensity value thus the higher selection response. Selection accuracy of production characteristics was based on its heritability value.","Magelang duck; Production characteristics; Selection intensity; Selection productivity; Selection responses",,,,,,,,"Hailu, M.A.H., Zewdu, W., Indigenous chicken production system and breeding practice in north wollo, amhara region, Ethiopia (2013) Poult Fish Wildl Sci., 1 (2), pp. 108-111; Adzitey, F., Adzitey, S.P., Duck production: Has a potential to reduce povertyamong rural households in asian communities-a review (2011) J.

The feeding trial lasted for 56 days. One hundred and forty unsexed day old broiler chicks (Marshall strain) were used for the study. RBS was incorporated into the diets at 15% and 30% levels and supplemented with 0%, 0.25% and 0.5% of lysine, respectively. Average weekly feed intake in birds fed the control diet and 15% RBS based diet supplemented with 0.25 % and 0.5% lysine were not significantly different, but significantly (P<0.05) higher than those fed other diets. Feed conversion efficiency and protein efficiency ratio were significantly (P<0.05) reduced in birds fed 30% RBS with or without lysine supplementation. At 0.25% and 0.5% lysine supplementation, significant (P<0.05) increases were obtained in the retention of nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus and iron in birds fed 15% RBS based diets, but markedly reduced in those fed 30% RBS based diets. The reductions in the performance characteristics of the birds fed 30% RBS diets with or without lysine can be attributed to interactions in the toxic effects of the higher intakes anti-nutritional factors like tannin, oxalate and phytate. In conclusion, the response indices were better enhanced when 15% RBS supplemented with 0.5% lysine was fed to the birds.","Benne seeds; Lysine supplementation; Utilization",,,,,,,,"Abebe, S.T.R., Morris, Note on the effects of protein concentration on responses of responses of dietary lysine by chicks (1990) Br.

The research design applied was completely randomized design with 3 treatments and 5 replications. Fifteen local male lambs aged 9-12 months weighing 14-17 kg, were divided into 3 groups of different diet treatments (P0 : sheeps were only given a basal diet; P1 : sheeps are given basal diet and 3% cooking oil; P2 : sheeps are given basal diet, 3% cooking oil and protected by 3% Citrus hystrix powder). The data were analyzed by analysis of variance, the differences among treatments were tested by Duncan's New Multiple Range Test. The results showed meat from sheeps that consume P2 diet has a total fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acids content were higher (P<0.01), with lower cholesterol content (P<0.01) than of P0, and has a protein and fat content were higher (P <0.01), but a lower water content (P<0.01) than that of PO. It can be concluded that the use of Citrus hystrix powder as fat protector can increase content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, protein and fat, but decrease cholesterol content.","Chemical composition; Cholesterol; Citrus hystrix; Fat protector; Meat; Unsaturated fatty acids",,,,,,,,"(2012) Official Methods of Analysis, , AOAC. 19th ed.

Vinegar was prepared from banana peel and coconut water, and the efficacy against Escherichia coli O157:H7 was tested. Chicken meat were treated with vinegar solution (equals to 1% acetic acid), acetic acid solutions (1%), and lactic acid solutions (2%), control (distilled water). Samples were soaked with acid solution treatment for 1 minute (1.125:1 w/v; chicken meat: solution treatment). Treated samples were inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 on the surface of the chicken meat, then left for 20 minutes for absorption of bacteria into the meat. Observation was done at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 days at low temperature storage, and at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24 hours at room temperature storage. The results showed that banana peel vinegar and coconut water vinegar were effective as natural preservative. In conclusion, the vinegar were potentially inhibited E. coli O157:H7 growth at chicken meat until 12 hours at room temperature storage and 9 days at cold temperatures.","Banana peel vinegar; Coconut water vinegar; Escherichia coli O157:H7; Poultry meat",,,,,,,,"Bell, F.M., Marshall, T.R., Anderson, E.M., Microbiological and sensory tests of beef treated with acetic and formic acids (1986) Journal of Food Protection, 49, pp. 207-210; Chang, J.M., Fang, T.J., Survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enteritica serovars Typhimurium in iceberg lettuce and the antimicrobial effect of rice vinegar against E.

Eighteen local male goats of Kacang goat with body weight of 9.23 ?} 1.71 kg and aged at ?} 10 months were arranged into three treatments in completely randomized design. The treatments were T0 (group without chemical anthelmintic treatment and no supplementation of fermented coffee husk), T1 (without chemical anthelmintic treatment, but supplied with fermented coffee husk) and T2 (group with chemical anthelmintic and no supplementation of fermented coffee husk). All goats were offered a basal diet in the ratio of 60% natural grasses along with 40% concentrate. Fermented coffee husk was added in the diet as much as 6% from the dry matter need. The result showed that there were no significant effect to dry matter intake, daily weight gain, PCV value and eosinophil counts (P>0.05). The supplementation of fermented coffee husk (T1) enhanced Hb and red blood cell (RBC) value (P<0.05) while no significant difference to T2. There were no nematodes infection in T1 and T2 with the eggs count were zero while the animals in T0 were still infected. This result indicated that fermented coffee husk can be used as a promising natural anthelmintic supplement with the improvement of Hb value, RBC, egg counts and daily weight gain. © 2015 Diponegoro University.

The objective of this study was to confirm the effects of the SNP in LOC514211 on productive traits in another population of Chinese Holstein dairy cow. Four hundred and seventy dairy cows were use in this study, genomic DNA was extracted from the blood of dairy cow, PCR-RFLP was applied to genotype of these DNA samples. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed by the General Linear Model (GLM) procedure of SAS 9.13 to identify the association of SNP with milk and reproductive traits. Results showed that SNP in LOC514211 was polymorphic in this herd of dairy cow and was in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium, and had significant differences among genotype in milk yield, milk quality and reproductive traits, which were similar with the results of previous GWAS study based SNP-Chips. Inconclusion, indicated that this SNP in LOC514211 might be potential markers for both milk and reproductive traits. © 2015 Diponegoro University.

Those ducks were raised intensively. There were nine treatments included R0 (control feed), R1 (control feed + 2.5% Pomacea canaliculata snails from swampy area), R2 (control feed + 5% Pomacea canaliculata snails from swampy area), R3 (control feed + 7.5% Pomacea canaliculata snails from swampy area) R4 (control feed + 10% Pomacea canaliculata snails from swampy area) R5 (control feed + 2.5% Pomacea canaliculata snails from tidal swampy area), R6 (control feed + 5% Pomacea canaliculata snails from tidal swampy area, R7 (control feed + 7.5% Pomacea canaliculata snails from tidal swampy area, and R8 (control feed + 10% Pomacea canaliculata snails from tidal swampy area. The variables observed included meat chemical and physical quality. A Completely Randomized Design was used in this study. Analysis of variance and Duncan's multiple range test were used to analyze data. The research results revealed that using Pomacea canaliculata snails in duck feed had a significant effect (P<0.05) towards the physical characteristics (water holding capacity, cooking loss, and tenderness), and chemical characteristics of Alabio duck meat (water, protein, collagen, fat, and cholesterol content). However, there was no significant effect towards meat pH. It can be concluded that using 5% Pomacea canaliculata snails in a mixture of Alabio duck feed decreased cooking loss and meat cholesterol content. © 2015 Diponegoro University.

The study used 16 Ettawah cross bred male goats with body weight average of 16 kg and aged at 7 months. The dietary treatments were: T0 = total mixed ration (0.09% of Hibiscus tiliaceus leaf sapponin, 8.69 % of CP, 62.11% of TDN), T1 = T0 + 3% soybean meal protein, T2 = T0 + 6% soybean meal protein, and T3 = T0 + 9% soybean meal protein. The treatments were allotted in a completely randomized design, with 4 treatments and 4 replicates of each. The results showed that dietary treatments did not effect significantly (P>0.05) on intakes of dry matter, carbohydrate, energy, ruminal butirat and valerat concentrations. Crude protein intake, feed digestibility, ruminal acetate and propionate concentrations, ratio of non-glucogenic to glucogenic VFAs, and estimated methane production were increased (P<0.05) by dietary experiments.

Freeze-dried spermatozoa had stored in the refrigerator at 4°C for 2 years. Computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) was used in this study to identify sperm head morphometry, while for DNA integrity analysis using acridine orange staining. Samples were smeared on glass slides, fixed for 2 h in acetic alcohol and stained with acridine orange solution. After staining, each slide was examined at x400 magnification in a fluorescence microscope with axio vision (Zeiss Company, Germany). Proportion of fluorescence red and green emissions of the sperm head were examined and scored. These results indicated that sperm head had enlarged significantly (P<0.05) after freeze-drying process. However, freeze-dried sperm heads morphometry significantly (P<0.05) decrease after incubation for 3 and 6 hours. Changes of DNA integrity of freeze-dried spermatozoa significantly (P<0.05) decrease after incubation for 6 hours. In the present study concluded that (1) freeze-drying spermatozoa caused sperm head morphometric enlarged, whereas incubation time caused sperm heads decreased, (2) DNA integrity of freeze-dried sperm head is still intact during incubation 3 hours, and decreased DNA integrity occur in incubation for 6 hours. © 2015 Diponegoro University.

Ovaries were collected from slaughterhouse and stored in physiological saline for 2-4 h, 5-7 h and 8-10 h at various temperatures (27-28°, 36-37° and 4°C). Cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were collected with slicing method from each group and matured in vitro for 26 h. There was no difference between the proportions of oocytes maturation to metaphase II when collected from ovaries stored at 27-28°C and 36-37°C for 2- 7 h of slaughter. However, the percentages of oocytes from ovaries stored at 4°C were significantly lower (P<0.05) than those stored at higher temperature (69.23%, 70.83% and 45.65%, for 27-28, 36-37 and 4°C at 2-4 h, respectively; 59.61%, 64,58% and 36.36% for 27-28, 36-37 and 4°C at 5-7 h, respectively). The proportion of oocytes meiosis to metaphase II (MII) were significantly (P<0.05) decreased when the ovaries stored at 27-28 and 36-37°C for 8-10 h, but not in oocytes stored at 4°C (24.37%, 7.84% and 45.23%, respectively). The maturation rate of oocytes from ovary stored at 4°C was higher than those collected from ovaries stored at higher temperature (P<0.05). This finding indicated that the storage of ovaries at 4°C for 8-10 h is effective for maintaining the development competence of sheep oocyte better than storage at higher temperature. © 2015 Diponegoro University.

There were four PUFA-concentrates, no supplement (PC0), 0.5% or 5 g yeast (PCY), 2% or 20 g curcuma powder (PCC), and 0.5% or 5g yeast with 2% or 20g curcuma powder (PCM). These PUFA-concentrates were evaluated for nutrients and fatty acid contents during 2, 4, and 6 weeks of storage. The application of treatments utilized in this research was completely randomized design with repeated measurement and split plot statistical analysis. Results showed that the contents of dry matter, organic matter, ether extract, crude protein, N-free extract, gross energy, acid detergent fiber, Ca, P, and Saccharomyces cereviseae were significantly (P<0.05) remained stable as caused by unchained moisture of PUFA-concentrate with combined supplements (Y5C20) in the 6 weeks of storage. The total PUFA (P), P/S, monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), and long chained fatty acid contents tended to be high in PUFA-concentrate with 2% or 20 g curcuma powder. Whereas, the PUFA-concentrate with a combination of 0.5% or 5 g yeast and 2% or 20 g curcuma powder was higher in unsaturated (U) fat and the ratio of U/S. In conclusion, combining all nutrient performances during the storage of 2 to 6 weeks, the PUFA-concentrate with 0.5% or 5 g yeast and 2% or 20 g curcuma powder was considered nutritionally good. © 2015 Diponegoro University.

However, improper use of OTC with excessive doses potentially leads to residue formation in animal products that can be harmful to consumers in the form of allergic reaction or resistance. This study aimed to detect OTC residues in broiler chicken meat, marketed in traditional markets and supermarkets in Depok, Bekasi, Bandung, Cilegon, Surakarta and Yogyakarta using indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) method. The analyses of 67 broiler meat samples showed only 1 (1.5%) sample was positive for the OTC residue at 86.1 ng/g which meant below the maximum residue limits of permissible OTC (100 ng/g). Nevertheless, a stricter regulation for the use of OTC in the poultry industry and the monitoring of its residue in chicken products prior to marketing is still necessary to avoid the adverse effects of the residue present in animal products. © 2015 Diponegoro University.

LPL controls triacylglycerol partitioning between adipose tissue and muscle that increases fat storage or provides energy in the form of fatty acids for muscle growth. The research was aimed to explore Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms of LPL gene and to associate SNP with marbling quality. A total of 66 genomic DNAs consisted of sumatera thin-tail ed sheep (50 heads) and garut sheep (16 heads) were used in this study. Polymerase Chain Reaction was used to amplify genomic DNA and direct sequencing method was to identify polymorphism sequences. The sequences were analyzed with Bio Edit and MEGA 5.2. The BLAST sequence was obtained from gene bank X.68308.1. The association between the genotype and marbling quality was analyze by one way ANOVA and further between mean differences were tested using least sgnificant difference. The results showed that 3 novel SNPs i.e. insertion g.26>C; insertion g.27> G and c.192T>C on garut sheep and a SNP insertion g.26>C/G on sumatera thin-tail ed sheep.

A total of 270 broiler chickens (initial body weight of 163.12 ± 8.10g) were allocated into a completely randomized design with a 3 x 3 factorial pattern. The first factor was the cage density (bird/m2) namely, D1 = 8; D2 = 10, and D3 = 12. The second factor was BC level (%), namely, B1 = 1; B2 = 2, and B3 = 3. Feed consumption, body weight gain (BWG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), protein digestibility, and income over feed cost (IOFC) were the parameters measured. Data were subjected to ANOVA and continued to Duncan test. No interaction between cage density and black cumin on all parameters was observed. Feed consumption and FCR were increased, but BWG was lowered significantly (P&lt;0.05) due to the cage densities of 10 and 12 birds/m2 on weeks 2 and 3. Protein digestibility was significantly increased by feeding 2 and 3% BC. IOFC decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05) when cage densities were 10 and 12 birds/m2. In conclusion, the improvement of productive efficiency of broiler chicken reared at the cage density of 12 birds /m2 can be sufficiently achieved by feeding 1% black cumin. © 2015 Diponegoro University.

Sixteen Ettawah Grade goats in the second milk production periods and in the 4-5th month of lactation were used in this study. The study was arranged with completely randomized block block design based on milk production as replications. The goats were fed ration containing 16% of crude protein and 65% of total digestible nutrients (TDN). Some of crude protein content were supplied by urea. The treatments were control ration (without urea; T0), ration with 0.4% urea (T1), ration with 0.8% urea (T2), and ration with 1.2% urea (T3). Parameters observed were feed digestibility, fecal extended level (FEL), and fecal rough particle distribution (FRPD). Data were analyzed using correlation-regression to find the correlation between fecal characteristics and feed digestibility. The results showed that urea content in the rations up to 1.2% of dry matter did not affect dry mater digestibility, water content and fecal characteristics (FEL and FRPD). There were highly negative correlation (r= -0.665) between feed digestibility and water content of feces as well as feed digestibility and FEL (r= -0.553), while correlation between digestibility and FRDP was positive (r=0.608). The conclusion of this study was water content, degree of FEL and FRPD can be used to determine the quality of feed. If feces composed of finer texture, dried and small particles indicated having better digestibility, while if feces composed of rough texture, wet, and large particles indicated having low digestibility. © 2015 Diponegoro University.

A total of 80 thirty-six wk-old laying ducks were divided into four dietary treatments and each of four replicates with 5 birds. Diets were formulated with a commercial concentrate, rice bran and yellow corn (2:4:4) according to a commercial standard diet as a control, and three other dietary treatments with 2, 4 or 8% of green algae were included. Fresh water green algae had a significant effect on the feed uptake, egg production, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) (p<0.05). Egg production and FCR improved at added 2 and 4% green algae. No differences were observed in egg yolk index, albumen index, Haugh Unit, and egg shell thickness (P>0.05) except egg yolk color. The yolk color increased within 7 days after feeding with the test diets. The present study indicated that fresh-water green algae could be used as a natural coloring agent in laying ducks and at 8% of green algae showed the highest score of (Roche Yellow Color-15). © 2015 Diponegoro University.

The β-sub unit dictates its binding specificity with their receptor (FSHR). This study aimed to identify polymorphism of FSH β-sub unit and FSHR genes, and its effect to superovulatory response traits on superovulated cows. Study was done on 32 cows including Angus, Friesian Holstein (FH), Limousin, Simmental and Brahman in Cipelang Livestock Embryo Center. Cows used have been treated superovulation and mated by artificial insemination. Superovulation response (SR), ovulation rate (OR), fertilization percentage (FP) and viable transfer embryo percentage (VP) were analyzed to investigate the effect of FSH β-sub unit and FSHR polymorphism. Allele frequency of FSH β-sub unit|PstI and FSH|AluI were opposite within species. Mostly B allele and C allele for FSH β-sub unit and FSHR respectively have a high number in Bos taurus species while those were in contrast in Bos indicus species. The highest heterozygosity was found in FH cattle (0.250) for FSH β-sub unit and Brahman (0.333) for FSHR. Significant effect was found between FSHR gene polymorphism with ovulation rate where CC genotype was higher (P<0.05) than CG and GG genotypes. © 2014 Diponegoro University.

The objective of this research was to identify adoption level of beef cattle intensive rearing and some factors that affecting farmers adoption. Research design was survey with 90 respondents from a total of 578 farmers. Data were obtained through interview and observations using questionnare with close question. The data were analyzed with multiple regression models. The level of intensive rearing adoption (dependent variable) was measured based on housing system, feeding, reproduction, health management and feces utilization. While, independent variables were based on the intensity of extension, relative adventage, subjective norm, control of behavior, attitude, age, land area and scale of business. Level of housing system, feeding, reproduction and health management were in the medium level (average >50% of farmers), while feces utilization was in the lowest level. Factors that positively affected farmer adoption in Wajo regency were the ability of the farmers to control their behavior (p<0.01), farmer position in social community or subjective norm and relative adventage were significant with p<0.05. Another case with contact to the extension, age, attitude, land area and scale of business were no significant affected farmers adoption.

Twelve heads of Ongole grade (PO) cow from slaughterhouse were used in this study. Twenty four urine samples of pre-slaughter and slaughtering were collected to evaluate the CA and CO levels by ELISA method and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR). Data of CA and CO levels were statistically analyzed to determine the difference between pre slaughter and slaughter conditions. FTIR spectra were analyzed using chemo-metrics software. The results showed that the levels of urinary cortisol were 2.12±1.68 ng/dl of pre-slaughter and 7.58±3.89 ng/dl of slaughtered and the levels of urinary catecholamine in pre slaughter and slaughter were 3.07±2.05 and 4.15±2.68 ng/dl respectively. The results showed a correlation between the FTIR spectra and the results of ELISA analysis. FTIR spectrums were distributed in different quadrants, this was caused by differences of CA and CO levels between pre-slaughter and slaughtered.

The first study was conducted to isolate and select the fiber-digesting bacteria from the digestive tract of termites based on the highest activity of cellulolytic (S), xylanolytic (X) and lignolytic (L). The second study was optimation of the growth conditions of bacteria and the enzyme production due to effect of rice straw substrate and nitrogen. The material used were dry wood termites, rice straw, and culture medium. The design used was a completely randomized factorial design, in which the first factor was rice straw substrate (1, 2, and 3% W/V), while the second factor was nitrogen (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3% W/V). Variables measured were cellulase, xylanase and ligninase activities. Results of the first sudy showed that the isolates obtained consisted of 3 types, those were cellulolytic bacteria (S1, S2, and S3), 3 types of bacteria xylanolytic (X1, X2, and X3) and 3 types of bacteria lignolytic (L1, L2, and L3). Meanwhile, results of the second study showed that isolates of S2, X3, and L1 had the highest activity, those were 1.894 U/mL, 1.722 U/mL and 0.314 U/mL, respectively. In conclusion, the addition of 1% level of rice straw substrate and 0.3% of nitrogen showed the highest enzyme activity on cellulase, xylanase and ligninase. © 2014 Diponegoro University.

This research was conducted in two stages. Stage 1 was cacao pod fermentation. Completely randomized design with 3x3 factorial patterns was used in this stage, in which factor I was microbial inoculum dosage of 0%, 0.05% and 0.1% and factor II was incubation period of 0, 3 and 6 days. Result demonstrated that six-day fermentation with 0.05% microbial inoculum could lower cacao NDF, ADF and theobromine. The optimum inoculum dosage and fermentation time from stage 1 was applied to stage 2. Stage 2 was rumen microbial fermentation test. This research administrated 3x3 of Latin square design. In period I sheep were fed with CF0 (nonfermented complete feed), in period II sheep were given CF 1 (complete feed containing fermented cacao pod) and in period III sheep were given CF2 (fermented complete feed based cacao pod). Result demonstrated that pH value of sheep microbial liquid in treatment of CF0, CF1 and CF2 was in normal pH range and did not affect volatile fatty acids (VFA) and ammonia. In conclusion, supplementing up to 50% of feed with complete feed containing fermented or non-fermented cacao pod did not affect the process of rumen microbial fermentation. © 2014 Diponegoro University.

This study were used 12 rams of 12-18 months old with average of initial body weight of 27.05±2.9 kg (CV = 10.74%). The experimental design used in this study was a completely randomized design (CRD) with 3 treatments and 4 replications. The treatments were feeding during the day (06.00-18.00; DF), feeding at night (18.00-06.00; NF), and feeding all day and night (06.00-06.00; DNF). The diet was offered ad libitum. The results showed that feeding during the day and/or at night did not significantly affect (P>0.05) all parameters observed. The average of dry matter intake (DMI), average daily gain (ADG), gross energy intake (GEI), energy digestibility (DE) and energy metabolizability (ME) were 1006 g/d, 75 g/d, 19.2 MJ/d, 74.0% of gross energy, and 66.2% of gross energy, respectively. The feed efficiency ratio (FCR), gross energy efficiency, digestible energy efficiency, and metabolizable energy efficiency were 7.38%, 3.86 g ADG/MJ, 5.24 g ADG/MJ, and 5.84 g ADG/MJ, respectively.

The collected samples were divided into three groups: One group was fresh samples (F). The second group was oven-dried at 55°C for 48h (OD) and the last group was freeze-dried at -40°C for 72h (FD). Results showed that the mean value of gas production from fresh SG and MEC samples were not significantly higher (P<0.05) than from FD and OD samples. In SG and MEC, the mean value of gas production of FD was not significant compared to OD samples (P>0.05). Gas production from samples added with PEG were higher (P<0.05) than without PEG. In conclusion, the preparation and drying methods of feed samples could affect the volume of gas production. The addition of PEG in SG and MEC resulted in higher gas production volumes. © 2014 Diponegoro University.

The research was conducted using seven Bali cattle, approximately 2 years of age, kept in healthy condition with normal estrous cycles. Observation of estrus symptoms was performed daily. Ovarian follicles was examined and measured using ultrasonography started at the estrus day. Blood samples were collected from jugular vein, blood sample collection and ultrasonographical examination of the ovaries were performed daily in the same time. Serum level of estradiol 17-β was performed using EIA. The short cycle estrus were observed in 4 Bali cattle (n=7) among natural estrous cycle. They have only one wave ovarian follicular development whereas the maximal size of ovarian follicles ovulation likes the normal cycle The duration of short estrous cycle was 7-10 days with normal usual estrus behavior. The peak of blood serum level was 107.77 ± 55.94 pg/ml when the diameter dominant follicle of short estrous cycle was reached 10.5 ± 0.38 mm. It can be concluded that the short estrous cycles may occur in Bali cattle after puberty among normal cycles. © 2014 Diponegoro University.

This study was aimed to identify polymorphisms of the κ-Casein gene of local buffaloes in Indonesia. A total number of 40 heads of riverine buffalo and 250 heads of swamp buffalo. This study used PCR-RFLP method, which amplification of the κ-Casein gene resulted an amplicon with length of 157 bp, located in exon 4. The amplified fragment were digested with EcoRV restriction enzyme, which cut the κ-Casein gene in exon 4 at nucleotides of GAT|ATC, revealed the presence of one polymorphism at the base position of 23 bp that occurs with a substitution of Ile (ATC) of the T genetic variant into Thr (ACC) of the C genetic variant. Genotyping κ-Casein gene in riverine buffalo produced two types of allele, namely C allele (157 bp) and T allele (136 and 21 bp). These two alleles resulted in three types of genotypes, namely CC, CT, and TT. Frequency of the C allele was dominant to T allele. κ-Casein gene in swamp buffalo was monomorphic with one allele, namely C allele. Heterozygosity value of riverine and swamp buffaloes were low. PIC value in riverine and swamp buffalo ranged 0.000-0.288. Fixation index of κ-Casein gene in riverine buffalo was low (Siborong-borong SBBC = -0,0036; Deli Serdang = -0.025), but in swamp buffalo was in fixation. This study showed that κ-Casein|EcoRV were polymorphic in riverine buffalo and monomorphic in swamp buffalo. © 2014 Diponegoro University.

In experiment 1, either no or 10 μM of lacticin was added to hay or hay:concentrate (1:1, w/w) substrate. In experiment 2, the levels of lacticin additions were extended to 0, 10, 25 and 50 μM. Samples were incubated in three replicates in both experiments at 39oC for 24 h. Total gas production and methane emission were measured during and after the incubation, respectively. Results revealed that, in general, addition of lacticin had limited significant effects on gas production parameters compared to control (without lacticin addition). Lacticin addition up to 50 μM did not significantly decrease CH4 emission, although a tendency of methane reduction existed when lacticin was added at 25 μM. Hay diet produced significantly less methane emission than that of hay:concentrate diet both in experiment 1 and experiment 2 (P<0.05). It can be concluded that lacticin addition up to 50 μM was unable to decrease CH4 emission in vitro and therefore need to be tested further at higher concentrations. © 2014 Diponegoro University.

The research was conducted by a survey method, with 135 karapan cattle farmers as respondents in regencies of Bangkalan, Sampang, Pamekasan and Sumenep (mainland). The data were collected in the period of April to August 2012. Data of zootechnique indicators variables, farmer's motivation, allocation time of labour, labour skills, business scale, productivity of karapan cattle, farmers' performance and benefit of karapan cattle business were analysed by Lisrel 8.8 program. The results showed that factors of zootechnique, farmer's motivation, labour skills and business scale had highly significant influence (P<0.01) on productivity of karapan cattle, but allocation time of labour did not have significant influence (P>0.05). The performance of karapan cattle business was highly influenced by productivity of karapan cattle (P<0.01). The benefit of karapan cattle business was influenced (P<0.01) by performance of karapan cattle business. It is concluded that the farmer's benefit of karapan cattle business was influenced by performance of karapan cattle, which in turn was influenced by productivity of the karapan cattle. © 2014 Diponegoro University.

The parameters being tested included fermentation, microbial inoculation, and carbon source proportion. The observations were made after three weeks of fermentation on the color, odor, pH, contents of elements C, NH4, NO3, total-N, P2O5, K2O and pathogenic microbes (Fusarium sp., Coletotrichum sp., Salmonella sp. and Eschercia coli). The fertilizer were implemented for green Chinese cabbage in six locations. It was found that the aerobic fermentation system combined with inoculation of the decomposer microbes (Lactobacillus spp.) and the addition 20% (v/v) of a carbon source was the most appropriate method of fermentation in the production of liquid organic fertilizers from liquid waste of chicken slaughterhouse. The quality of the fertilizer which is based on physical, chemical and biological characteristics and crop responses still less than the similar commercial fertilizer (EM4). Nevertheless, the nitrogen and phosphor contents of this liquid fertilizer (92,000 ppm and 143,000 ppm) were significantly higher (P<0.05) than the EM4 (0.07 and 3.22 ppm). © 2013 Diponegoro University.

Results showed that there were no interactions between insoluble NSP sources and levels at any variable measured. Only levels of insoluble NSP had significant effect. Young broilers fed mash basal diet supplemented with 6% insoluble NSP decreased body weight gain (P<0.05) and impaired gain-to-feed ratio (P<0.01). Diets did not have a significant effect on feed intake (FI), in addition to the relative weight of gizzard, jejunum-ileum, caeca, and pancreas. Levels of NSP affected the weight of gastrointestinal digesta with jejunal-ileal digesta was found to be the highest (P<0.01) in 6% insoluble NSP supplementation. Dry matter of jejunal-ileal digesta and excreta moisture also did not significantly affected by diets (P≥0.05). The present study demonstrated that the insoluble NSP can be supplemented to young broilers diet up to 4%. It is likely that increased performance of young broilers supplemented with insoluble NSP up to 4% was due to increase FI and a better gut environment. The supplementation of insoluble NSP did not produce strong impact considering that the diets were given in mash form. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

Twenty four heads of two months old of Landrace x Yorkshire cross barrows were randomly divided into four treatment groups, i.e. without rice hull (R0), 10% rice hull (R1), 20% rice hull (R2), and 30% rice hull (R3). They placed in individual concrete pen with 1.9 m in length and 0.5 m in width. Feed and water were given as ad libitum. Observation was done for 10 weeks prior to slaughter. Completely Randomized Design was used in this study. Data obtained was analyzev by anova and mean comparison of Duncan's new Multiple Range Test. Fat content of R0, R1, R2, dan R3 pork were 14.09±0.31, 13.30±0.44, 12.9±20.30 and 11.95±0.56%, respectively. Fat content of pork of R0 was higher (P<0.05) than that of others groups. Cholesterol content of pork of R0, R1, R2 and R3 were 256.47±30.23, 252.34±26.56, 217.63±21.93 and 199.21±25.94 mg/100 g, respectively. Cholesterol content of pork of R3 were lower (P<0.05) than those of R0. It is concluded that the use of rice hull up to 30% in the dried hotel food waste based-diet can decreases fat and cholesterol levels of pork. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

A total of 20 Holstein Friesian cows at different stages of estrus cycle in a dairy herd were enrolled in the present study. The cows were randomly allocated into two treatment groups; with and without CIDR (Controlled internal drug release) insertion. All cows received 100 µg of GnRH I.M. at the beginning of the treatment (d 0) without regard to the stages of the estrus cycle followed by 25 mg PGF2α IM 7days later. Cows in CIDR group were inserted CIDR into the vagina at the time of GnRH administration and were removed on the day of PGF2α administration. estrus signs were checked twice daily starting on day-2 after initiation of the protocol, except cows in CIDR group the estrus signs were checked starting on day-8 of the protocol. The animals showing estrus signs were noted. Blood samples were collected from all animals on the days of GnRH and PGF2α treatments and on day-10 after initiation of protocol for progesterone concentration. The results of this study showed that 30% animals in cows without CIDR insertion showed estrus signs prior to PGF2α injection. Involving CIDR to synchronized estrus with GnRH-PGF2α based protocol avoided the occurrence of premature estrus and maintained high progesterone concentration on the day of PGF2α administration. It is concluded that ovarian response after involving CIDR in the protocol for estrus synchronization especially using combination of GnRH and PGF2α were much effective to synchronize the initiation of estrus in dairy cows. Likewise, the use of progesterone avoided premature estrus. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

Blood samples were taken from 46 cows consisted of of 17, 18 and 8 of sorrel, black and 8 heads, respectively, and 3 heads of bull. The PCR-RFLP method was performed to identify the gene. Amplification of PCR gene MC1R of Kupang's Bali Cattle (KBC) was 296 bp. The digestion by using MspI enzyme showed that there were EE genotype (169, 136 bp) in Bali bull, sorrel and white cows. Two 2 genotypes, those were EE (169, 136 bp) and Ee (296, 169, 136 bp) were found in black Bali cow. The frequency of E alele of KBC was 0.99 (99%) and e alele was 0.01 (1%). MC1R gene in KBC was monomorphic and the it can be used as the marker of the coat color in the population. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

A survey research was carried out to analyze the optimum raising duration and its relationship with income in the business of Simmental - Ongole Grade crossbred (SOG) beef cattle fattening. This research involved 50 farmers chosen purposively as respondents based on some specific criteria, i.e. the farmers had been experienced at least for 5 years, the business scale was 1 - 3 bulls and the cattle's live weight was around 250 - 350 kg. Data were taken by cross section and time series for 3 months, covering respondents' identity, cattle business condition, business inputs, cattle's weight, input and output prices. The data were analyzed using combined data regression model. The optimum raising duration was calculated using profit function per time, while the inputs were converted into time function. All of the costs and incomes of business were calculated. The results showed that the optimum raising duration of SOG beef cattle fattening was reached at the 1.5 months from the cattle aging 16.67 months old. The amount of the total cost, revenue and income in the optimum raising duration were IDR 7,161,740.00; IDR 7,797,100.00 and IDR 635,350.00, respectively. The amount of the cost, revenue and income in the optimum raising duration per kg of cattle live weight, were IDR 23,247.00; IDR 25,157.00 and IDR 1,910.00, respectively. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

The purpose of the study was to determine the pH value, the swelling percentage and collagen yield of chicken shank bones which were soaked by different HCl concentration and soaking time. The pH value and swelling percentage of chicken shank bones are indicator that determines amount of collagen yield. The research design used was factorial completely randomized design (CRD). Factor A was a concentration of HCl (2%, 3.5% and 5%) and factor B was a soaking time (24, 36 and 48 hours) without replication (profile). The result shows that the the increase of HCl concentration and soaking time affected on the decreasing of pH value profile (0.17-0.85), swelling percentage profile (80.25-97.49%) and also collagen yield (1.80 -10.02%). The lowest collagen yield of chicken shank bones was suspected caused by the used of Hcl. The highest result of the study was using 2% of HCl concentration for 24 hours. The best result was found in the use of 2% HCl and was soaked for 24 hours.

Twenty male JTTS of about 6 months old and 2 paddocks with field grass vegetation were used in the research. Treatment factor I was topography namely plain and slope, while treatment factor II was season, namely dry season and rainy season. The number of experimental sheep was divided into 4 groups with 5 heads of sheep for replication in each group and had been grazed for 2 months. The measured variables were soil pH, Mn content in the soil, forage, feces, and blood plasma. The collected data were processed using analysis of variance with factorial treatment pattern of 2 X 2 in completely randomized design. Mn level in blood plasma of sheep grazed on plain and slope paddocks were 0.62 and 0.61 mg/l, respectively, in dry season whereas in rainy season were 0.68 and 0.52 mg/l, respectively. Topography did not influence the level of Mn in blood plasma in dry season. Level of Mn in blood plasma of the sheep was lowest in slope area, whereas in plain area was the highest (P<0.05).

West Java, Indonesia","Antibacterial properties of three medicinal plants used widely amongst the native Indonesians, i.e., sirih (Piper betel), garlic (Allium sativum) and jinten hitam (Nigella sativa) were screened and evaluated against Salmonella sp. isolates. For this purpose, the three plants' powder, aqueous and ethanol extracts were prepared. The tests' results demonstrated the three plants' anti Salmonella sp. activities. In this conjunction, the aqueous extract of Allium sativum, the ethanol extracts of Nigella sativa, and Piper betel, consecutively produced 17 mm, 15 mm and 13 mm diameter of bacterial growth inhibition zones. As a comparison, sensitivity tests of three commercial antibiotics, i.e., chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and gentamycin on Salmonella sp. isolates produced 19.7-27.3 mm growth inhibition zones. Garlic having antimicrobial potential was comparable to the commercial antibiotics, can be used as a decontaminant against Salmonella sp. to maintain the quality of the broiler carcasses and therefore prolonging the carcass shelf-life. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

The treatments were, T1 slashing of Chromolaena every month, T2 digging up of Chromolanea, and exposed to dry (mulching), T3 digging up of Chromolaena followed by burning, T4 digging up of Chromolaena followed by burning and sowing with Centrosema pubescens and T5 digging up of Chromolaena followed by burning and planting with Brachiaria decumbens. Results of experiment showed that under drought conditions, digging up Chromolaena was very effective in suppressing regrowth of Chromolaena but it was not effective to other weeds. Among treatments, digging out of Chromolaena followed by burning and planting with Brachiaria decumbens was the most effective and slashing of Chromolaena every month was the least effective in suppressing weeds. Botanical composition was shifted with treatments. Stachytarpheta jamaicensis and Chromolaena were the dominant species in monthly slashed Chromolaena plots, Stachytarpheta and Calopogonium muconoides were the dominant species in mulched plots while Mimosa pudica, Brachiaria and Centrosema were the dominant species in burnt plots. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

Forty eight of broiler chickens with an average body weight of 900 g, were randomly divided into 8 treatments (one treatment was fasted and 7 were fed ration plus feed additive), containing six birds per treatment. The formulation of nanoparticle in this study used ionic gelation method. Method used to evaluate the metabolizable energy was total collection. Chickens were fasted one day before and after they were treated with rations. Nitrogen, gross energy and total weight of feed and excreta or ileal digesta released were analyzed to calculate the true metabolizable energy of the ration. It was found that the basal ration added with nanocapsule 0.1% had true metabolizable energy (3370.66 kcal/kg) significantly higher (P<0.05) than basal ration (3214.85 kcal/kg). The result of this study concluded that formulation of nanocapsule using turmeric extract and industrial chitosan as the polymer and sodium-tripolyphosphate as cross linker was potential to increase true metabolizable energy so it can be an alternative for broiler chicken feed additive. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

The meats of Bali cattle, Kacang goat, native chicken, and local duck were used in this study. The meats were ground using food processor added with aquadest to obtain meat extract. The meat extracts were then hydrolyzed using protease enzymes to obtain hydrolysate of meat protein. Protein concentration of meat extract and hydrolysate of meat protein were determined, and were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate - poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). ACE inhibitory activity of hydrolysate of meat protein derived from Bali cattle, Kacang goat, native chicken, and local duck was also determined. The results showed that protein concentration of hydrolysate of meat protein of Bali cattle, Kacang goat, native chicken, and local duck meat was significantly higher than their meat extracts. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that hydrolysate of meat protein of Bali cattle, Kacang goat, native chicken, and local duck had more peptides with lower molecular weight, compared to their meat extracts. Hydrolysate of meat protein of Bali cattle, Kacang goat, native chicken, and local duck had potencies in inhibiting ACE activity, so it will potentially reduce blood pressure. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

Semen was collected from three mature rams by artificial vagina. Semen was evaluated by macroscopic and microscopic. Semen was divided into ten tubes, the semen of first five tubes was unwashed (W0) and diluted with extender 0%, 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% soybean lecithin (L0, L1, L2, L3 and L4). Semen of another five tubes were washed (W1) then each diluted with similar extender levels. The diluted semen samples were stored at 5 0 C and the sperm motility and viability were evaluated each day. The interaction of the semen washing and soybean lecithin levels were no significant differences (P&gt;0.05) but the single factor of soybean lecithin level was significant differeNces (P&lt;0.05) and the single factor of semen washing were no significant differences (P&gt;0.05) on progressive motility and viability of ram sperm.The best extender was 3% soybean lecithin (L3) with the percentage of ram sperm progressive motility was 63.18 ± 3.61% and viability was 71.76±2.32%. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

Two hundreds of Isa Brown laying hens were used in this study. The hens were raised in individual battery cages units for 12 weeks. Four calcium source (limestone as a control, 5% limestone + 2.5% eggshells waste, 2.5% limestone + 5% eggshells waste and 7.5% eggshell waste) were used in feed experiment. A completely randomized design was applied, with 4 treatments and 5 replications. Each experimental unit consisted of 10 laying hens. The parameters measured were feed intake, protein intake, calcium intake, phosphorus intake, egg production, egg weight and feed conversion ratio. Results of the research showed that the calcium source had significantly effect on performance productions. The use of eggshell waste 7.5% significantly increased the feed intake, calcium intake, phosphorus intake, egg production and egg weight except for feed conversion ratio. The conclusion of this research was that the use of eggshell waste as calcium source of feed resulted in better performance than using limestone or mixed limestone with eggshell waste. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

Plant samples were obtained from various collection sites in different countries, i.e. Indonesia (n = 27 species), Mongolia (n = 14), Switzerland (n = 16) and Germany (n = 3). The plants were incubated in vitro with buffered-rumen fluid at 39oC for 24 h. Total gas production was recorded as an indicator of feed quality and emission of CH4 was measured. Results showed that, based on bivariate screening, generally, plants possessed low CH4 production had low quality or low total gas production except Rhus typhina, i.e. 43 ml/200 mg DM. The loading plot of PCA showed that all phenolic fractions were in the opposite direction with CH4 and total gas production. Plants clustered together in reverse direction to that of CH4 were Bergenia crassifolia root and leaf, Swietenia mahagoni, Clidemia hirta, Peltiphyllum peltatum, Acacia villosa and R. typhina. It was conluded that, for tannin-containing plants, screenings based on univariate, bivariate and multivariate approaches in relation to ruminal CH4 emission led to similar results. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

The study utilized AP (crossbred of Alabio ♂ with Peking ♀) and PA (crossbred of Peking ♂ and Alabio ♀ ducks) with a total of 180 birds. The observed variables were the duration of cessation of egg production before and after molting, the prolactin hormone level in the period of molting, the egg production period before and after molting. The data was analyzed using ANOVA, regression and correlation. The results showed that AP crossbred had fewer molting (23.33%) compared to PA (50.00%). The mechanism of molting is always preceded by cessation of egg production, molting and relaying. The prolactin hormone concentrations of AP and PA in the period before and after molting were significantly higher than in the period of molting. At the egg production period before molting, the prolactin hormone concentration of AP ducks was higher than the PA ducks. So that the egg production of AP before molting (0-16 weeks) was higher than the PA. The egg production of AP was higher than PA, 256.66±6.00 vs 232.22±6.64 eggs for 48 weeks. So it can be concluded that the prolactin hormone affects the molting and egg production. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

This research was done in East Java. Survey method was used to answer the objective. The study location were selected by purposive sampling. Usually deer was develop in conservation area, but because the area was decrease so the number of deer also decrease. Model of deer raising development should be improved not only for conservation but also for commercial purpose. The optimum deer raising were considered and monitored with a purpose to maximize commercial Timor deer by using Multiple Objective Goal Programming (MOGP) to find the Optimistic Rate Estimation. The result of this study showed to get the optimum benefit, it had to be applied together with conservation and commercial effort at the same time. Results of study showed that profit was taken from selling velvet was 164.46%. Profits taken from selling antler was 350.56%, from selling alive deer was 394.28%, from selling recreation tickets was 259.08%, from selling venison1 was 135.98%, and from selling deer leather was 141.24%. Operational cost spent were 168.46% for feeding cost, 213.23% for maintenance cost, and 232.04% for labors' salaries. The amount of operational cost required in MOGP model, with lower expenses and commercial priority were 185.54% for feeding cost, 253.13% for maintenance cost, and 246.95% for paying labors' salaries. The MOGP model result with commercial priority reached 335.21%, while in MOGP model with lower costs and commercial priority gave profit for breeders up to 381.26%. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

Total respondents were 495 farmers, in which 225 farmers were members of the Village Unit Cooperative (VUC), 180 farmers were member of Various Business Cooperative (VBC) and 90 farmers were member of Farmer Group Association (FGA). Primary data were obtained through interviews with farmers and secondary data were obtained from related institution. Descriptive and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) analysis were used in the study. Based on LQ (Location Quotiens) analysis, dairy cattle in Central Java was potential to be developed. The LQ value of Semarang, Boyolali and Banyumas districs were 4.57, 7.68 and 0.46, respectively, with 4.24 on average. The dairy cattle farmer income was IDR 1.024.095/month with an average of scale ownership lactation cattle was 2.7 head/farmer. Model Goodness of Fit of SEM was fit with the SEM requirement. The productivity was influenced significantly (P<0.01) by environmental, economic, institutional, and social factors. Dairy cattle farmer income were influenced highly significant (P<0.01) by technical and institutional factors (P<0.05) of the income. These results indicated that the role of technical factors, social, economic, institutional and business environment needs to be considered in order to increase business productivity and farmer incomes. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

The polyclonal antibodies were isolated and purified from local horses immunized repeatedly using isolated and purified HBsAg from Indonesia. The antibodies were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase by a modified method of Nakane and Kawaoi. The conjugate activities were performed using the principle of ELISA test conducted by the researchers as well as by independent laboratory. Commercial conjugate for HBsAg ELISA was used as a comparison study. The results of this study indicated that the antibody produced from local horses can be used to make conjugates that were comparable to commercial HBsAg ELISA kit. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

This research was done from July to September 2010 in Sanggalangi' subdistrict, North Toraja district, South Sulawesi. Purposive sampling was applied to observe data. The primary data were taken by purposive sampling method and collected by interview of 90 farmers. Results showed that sex ratio of male-female was 3:2. The first estrus was 2.48 years old, the estrus period was 23 hours and the oestrus cycle was 19 days. The first mating was 2.87 years old with the conception period about 387 days. Furthermore, the first partus was at 3.74 years old, calving interval was 2 years. Calving rate and calf crops were relatively high. Calf crops were 77%, pre weaning mortality was 2.35%. Service per conception (S/C) was 1.85 and conception rate (CR) was 86.5%. The most livelihoods in North Toraja is farmer. Spotted Buffalo population declined 24.31 % per year. SWOT analysis showed that score for internal factor was -0.25, whereas external factor was 2.25. It was showed that the sub-district Sanggalangi is in turnaround condition, so the development strategy of Torajan's spotted buffalo has to minimize the weakness and reached the opportunities. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

Sixteen PO carcasses were used in the experiment which was arranged in a completely randomized design with 4 treatments of different meat shops (traditional market, meat shop, supermarket and slaughter house). Parameters measured were meat pH, water holding capacity, cooking loss and bacterial total count. The result showed that the average of pH was 5.25- 6.03; water holding capacity was 17.07-38.87%; cooking loss was 33.15-48.20 and bacterial total count was 1.48x106-10.75x106 CFU/g. It was concluded that bacterial total count in slaughter house and special market (meat shop and supermarket) were less than those in traditional market. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

Four hundred and twenty eight data of weaning weight, yearling weight and body weight gain were used to estimate genetic improvement for those traits. One hundred and seven data of body dimension (body weight, chest circumference, body length and withers height) at 24 months old were used to estimate genetic improving for those traits. The estimation of genetic and environmental variance and co-variance component, and heritability were found by animal model. The fix effect of weaning weight, yearling weight and body weight gain was rainfall, age of measurement and year of birth, whereas the fix effect of body dimension depend on each trait. The result showed that heritability of weaning weight, yearling weight, body weight gain, body weight, chest circumference, body length and withers height was 0.09±0.15, 0.27±0.13, 0.47±0.15, 0.07±0.19, 0.50±0.19, 0.34±0.28, 0.60±0.21, respectively.

The first factor was different sources of P fertilizer: Guizhou Phosphate Rock (GPR), Jingxiang Phosphate Rock (JPR), and Single Super Phosphate (SSP). The second factor was level of P fertilizer: 75, 100, and 125 mg P2O5/kg soil. A control treatment (without addition of P fertilizer, CK) was added as a comparison with the treatments. The results showed that JPR was the best for alfalfa production, whereas GPR and SSP were better for nutrient content in the alfalfa tissue than JPR.

A total of 432 male birds were weighed at one-d-old and randomly distributed to 48 wire-floored brooder cage each 1.0 m2. There were 2 sexes and 4 dietary treatments with 6 replicates each of 9 birds. Birds were given one of three dietary regimens with dietary change every 7 days. All groups were fed free choice of summit and dilution diets. The estimated dietary level of crude protein at day-old was 240 g/kg and the level at 42 d was either 120, 150 or 180 g/kg for females or 130, 160 and 190 g/kg for males. At 43 d of age, all birds from each dietary treatment were slaughtered for measurement of body composition. Results reveal that lysine requirement for maximum gain in this study was higher than NRC recommendation. The free choice-fed bird was significantly higher, in terms of growth and body composition than that obtained on the low dietary protein regimen. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

Twenty ISA-Brown laying hens at the age of 72 weeks were randomly distributed into three feeding treatments which consisted of cassava bagase (CB), WSPCB of solid state fermentation method (WSPCB-SSF), and WSPCB of sub merged fermentation method (WSPCB-SmF). All of the hens were fasted for 24 hours and 15 of them were fed with CB, WSPCB-SSF and WSPCB-SmF (five hens for each test-diet). The other five hens were still fasted. Then, all of the hens were fasted again and their excreta were collected during 48 hours. The nutrient digestibilities which were measured consisted of the Apparent and True Digestibility of Dry matter (ADDM and TDDM), Crude Fiber (ADCF and TDCF), Starch (ADS and TDS), and the Apparent and True Metabolizable Energy (AME and TME). The result of this research showed that the saccharification process generated the solid waste with the nutrient digestibility value (ADDM, TDDM, ADS, TDS, AME, and TME) which were significantly lower (P<0.05) than those of CB. The crude fiber digestibility value of the WSPCB has an oposite phenomenon in which the ADCF and TDCF of WSPCB-SmF were greater than CB. In conclusion, the nutrient digestibility value, except for ADCF and TDCF, of the WSPCB on the laying hens were lower in value than those CB. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

The meal were mixed with other locally available materials to produce 5 difference mineral formulas: P1: 100% limestone meal, P2: 50% limestone meal + 50% fresh water oyster shell meal, P3: 35% limestone meal + 30% fresh water oyster shell meal + 35% bone meal, P4: 35% limestone meal + 30% fresh water oyster shell meal + 34.2% bone meal + 0.5% salt + 0.3% micro minerals and P5: 100% fresh water oyster shell meal. The formulas were stored for 12 weeks. Samples were taken weekly for analyzing of moisture content and physical properties. By a feeding trial the five mineral formulas were mixed in the level of 6 % into basal diet and fed to 150 laying hens for 24 weeks. Parameters measured included body weight, feed intake, egg production and FCR. Results showed that the composites of Bukit Kamangs' limestone had difference hardness. The strongest was found by the black composite of 23.4 HRc-C or 245.0 BHN. The meal products contained large particles (>0.42 mm) of 17.8%. Moisture content of mineral formulas increased during storage, but their physical properties were no significant changes. The highest moisture increase was found by the product of 100% limestone, but it could be reduced by mixing with oyster shell meal and bone meal. The best laying performances (P<0.05) were found by the hens fed with diet supplemented with mineral formula containing limestone, fresh water oyster shell and fortified with micro minerals. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

It mainly focuses on calculating the needed number of productive cows to enhance beef production in the province. Out of the total farmer households in Manokwari, Indonesia, 189 farmer-respondents were selected as samples of the study. Selection of the sample was based on the number of cattle kept in every age group (less than one (&lt;1) year old; one to two (1-2) years old, and more than two (&gt;2) years old and the number of productive cows. Secondary data came from the time series data of the number of slaughtered cattle vis-à-vis the population of all districts in West Papua Province from 1980-2008. Data were analyzed using the Partial Adjustment Model (PAM) and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method. Results of the study showed that beef self-sufficiency in West Papua depend on the availability of the number of productive cows to produce ready-slaughtered-bull in the previous year. Particularly for West Papua, to produce one unit of bull in the tth -year, with the assumption that cattle mortality is 4.92%, a number of 2.38 animal units AU of productive cows must be provided in the previous two (2) years. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

All the cattle were in about 1.5 years-old with an average body weight of 147.75 ± 14.57 kg and 167 ± 22.57 kg, for Madura and OC cattle, respectively. They were fed Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) hay, and concentrate feeding consists of pollard, soybean meal and rice bran for 10 weeks. Parameters measured were concentration of VFA at 0, 3 and 6 h post-feeding and pH. The concentration of VFA in both Madura and OC cattle was peaked at 3 h postfeeding, being 136.1 mmol and 158.9 mmol, respectively, and then were decreased at 6 h post-feeding at a level of 58.1 and 98.2 mmol, respectively. The proportion of acetic acid in Madura and OC cattle were 53.33% and 52.0% of total VFA, respectively, while the proportion of propionic acid and butyric acid were 28.80% and 17.87% for Madura cattle, and 30.71% and 17.28% for OC cattle, respectively. In addition, the Acetic/Propionic ratios were 1.85 and 1.69 for Madura and OC cattle, respectively. Rumen pH conditions of both cattle breeds tended to be basic, i.e. Madura cattle was ranged at 8.0-8.4, while the PO cattle was ranged at 7.6-8.4. In conclusion, both cattle breeds (Madura and OC cattle) have a similar efficiency to utilize the feeds in the rumen. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

Twelve rabbits were immunized against ovPG DEAE-TrisHCl (DT), DEAE-NaCl 20mM (DN2), DEAE-NaCl 40mM (DN4), DEAE-NaCl 80mM (DN8), DEAE-NaCl 160mM (DN16), DEAE-NaCl 320mM (DN32) and DEAE-NaCl 1M (DN1) and NaCl 0.9 % as a placebo. The 0.5 ml of isolate (purified from ovine cotyledon) was emulsified in equal volume with complete and incomplete Freud's adjuvant. The mixture of each isolate and adjuvant was injected at mutiple sites along the dorsal area of rabbits by subcutaneous route. Blood were collected from marginal ear vein, starting before first injection (baseline) and every 14 days. Rabbit anti-ovPAG were measured using Modified ELISA Technique. By using Western Blot Technique, DN32 showed the best immune response among others and also could differenciate ovPAG in the urine of pregnant ewes It could be concluded that ovPAG DN32 is a specific source of rabbit anti-ovPAG production. Protein of ovPAG at molecular weight 31 kDa is a pregnancy protein marker of garut sheep and could be developed as a major protein for producing antibodi. © 2012 Diponegoro University.

Quality of NFC-fish meal that was made by dipping in extract of fermented vegetable's waste has been reported better than commercial fish meal, but the effect after storing remained in question. Experiment was conducted to study the effect of different time of storing on physic-organoleptical, chemical and microbiological characteristics of the acidified NFC-fish meal that was made by dipped in extract of fermented vegetable's waste (FVW-exctract). The NFC-Fish was soaked in the FVW-exctract by the ratio 1:1 (w/v) for 4 hours, and then it was dripped out and dried. The dried fish was ground passed through 20 mesh, kept into plastic bags and stored at the room temperature (23-25°C and 70-80% RH) for 0, 1, 2 and 4 months. Physic-organoleptical, chemical and biologycal characteristics were parameters observed. Experiment was conducted by completely randomized design (CRD). Data were analysed by the GLM of SAS. Actual number of moisture, crude protein, extract ether, and proteolytic bacteria of fish meal were significantly influenced by time of storing (P<0.05). Dipping NFC-fish in the FVW-exctract effectively maintain the physical characteristics, pH, moisture, crude protein, extract ether and the number of proteolytic bacteria of fish meal up to 2 months of storage. Dipping NFC-fish in the FVW-exctract provide better characteristics on physical, chemical and microbiologycal than the commercial fish meal at the same condition of storage. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

Spearman Rank Correlation test was used to determine the relationship between cooperativism and the performance of dairy cattle farming. Based on the results of the Spearman Rank correlation test, feeds and feeding practices were significantly correlated with sharing of knowledge and information and sharing of resources. However, no significant relationship was found between participation in decision making and feeds and feeding practices. Meanwhile, there were significant relationships amog sharing of knowledge and information, sharing of resources, and participation in decision making and milk production in Getasan Village. The dairy health as performance indicator of dairy cattle farming, sharing of knowledge and information was the only significant factor. Sharing of resources and participation in decision making had no significant relationship with dairy health. As regards marketing, the test showed that sharing of knowledge and information, sharing of resources, and participation in decision making were significantly related factors. This study indicated that cooperativism may provide opportunities for farmers to access services, information and resources that will allow them to improve their capacities in these areas. This study also proposed some recommendations that the cooperatives should promote activities encouraging greater cooperation and mutual understanding among the members. Skills trainings and education for empowerment should be conducted to encourage participation in decision making. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

Sixteen lactating dairy cows were distributed into 4 groups by using compelete randomized design (CRD). Group I (Control) fed by basal diet consisted of elephant grass and concentrate 7.5 kg/hd/dy (CP 16% and TDN 70%), Group II (Pro. Woodii) fed by basal diet + probiotic Woodii, Group III (Pro.Noterae) fed by basal diet + probiotic Noterae; Group IV (CRM-Noterae) fed by basal diet + CRM + Pro.Noterae. Measurements were conducted on body weight gain, average daily gain, feed conversion ratio, milk and methane production. Results showed that CRM-Noterae increased ADG by 72% (1.29 vs 0.75 kg) and improved FCR (9.2 vs 15.6). Probiotic noterae as single treatment or combined with CRM increased fat and total solid content of milk from 3.18% and 10.58% in control group to become 3.91%; 11.31% and 3.55%; 11.02%, respectively. The lowest methane production was recorded in Group IV. The combination of CRM and Noterae reduced percentage of methane production by 14%. It is concluded that combination of CRM and Noterae can improve dairy cow performance and decrease methane production. Probiotic Noterae improved milk quality. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

Under these circumstances, animal usually manifest depression and the impact on physiological condition changes and loss of body weight. The objectives of the research were to examine effect supplementation of organic-Cr type into diets in transport-stress beef cattle on physiological condition, haematochemical (included were haematological condition and blood chemical) and body weight changes. The experiment was conducted using 16 beef cattle those were transported by truck for a distance of 400 km from Malangbong to Tangerang. The experiment was arranged by Completely Randomized Design with four treatments and four replications. The dietary treatments consisted of R0 (basal diet without Cr supplemented), R1 (R0+3ppm organic-Cr resulted of alkali hydrolysis), R2 (R0+3 ppm organic-Cr resulted from bioprocess), R3 (R0+3 ppm organic-Cr resulted from bioremediation). The result indicated that type of organic-Cr supplementation at 3 ppm in diet did not influence physiological condition, haematochemical and body weight at beef cattle transported for seven hours. There was indication that beef cattle fed on control diet (without Cr) showed a stress symptom, their loss of body weight were higher (5.41%) compared to beef given diet contains organic-Cr (3.72%, 5.04% and 4.83%, respectively for R1, R2 and R3). © 2011 Diponegoro University.

Three different diets: A wheat-based diet, a guar gum diet (a wheat-based diet + 20 g/kg guar gum) and a lucerne meal diet (a wheat-based diet + 40 g/kg lucerne meal) in mash form were offered for 12 weeks. The results showed that birds fed guar gum diet had the lowest intake (p<0.01), egg weight (p<0.05), body weight (p<0.05) and the lowest egg production (p<0.01) compared to those fed other diets. Diets did not have a significant effect (p>0.05) on feed to egg ratio and cannibalism mortality, but numerically the birds fed the guar gum diet had the highest mortality (11.3%) and the lucerne diet had the lowest (6.9%). The lack of profound differences was probably due to the diets were given in mash form. In conclusion, diets containing high soluble NSP reduced the performance and increased the mortality due to cannibalism in laying hens. The use of mash form may have a potential in reducing the negative effect of soluble NSP on cannibalism. © 2011 Diponegoro University.

Tea leaves waste was fermented by Aspergillus Niger during 6 day. Fifteen of rats with initial weight of 41.17±4.05 g were fed ad libitum by diets containing different levels of unfermented and fermented tea leaves waste as follows: basal diet (R1), unfermented tea leaves waste 5% (R2), unfermented tea leaves waste 10% (R3), fermented tea leaves waste 5% (R4), fermented tea leaves waste 10% (R5). The results indicated that bioconversion of tea leaves waste in diet (R4 and R5) decreased almost all of fiber fractions (NDF 75.55%; ADF 57.17%; celluloses 26.74%; lignine 31.19%), except hemicelluloses 18.38%, while the treatment did not change the lipid binding rate (2.07 vs 1.98). Also, the result showed that rats fed with diets containing fermented tea leaves waste (R4 and R5) had reduced cholesterol (86.25;87.4 mg/dl) and triglyceride (47.06; 46.03 mg/dl), but not on HDLcholesterol (29.28; 26.51 mg/dl).

The research involved 368 male broilers of the New Lohman strain aged 8 days which were raised up to 35 days at different densities and floor types. Floor types consisted of rice hull litter and bamboo slat were used as the main plot; while densities of 7, 10, 13 and 16 birds/m2 applied as the sub-plot. The results showed that the final body weight gain of the 35-day Lohmann broilers at densities of 7, 10 and 13 birds/m2 were 28.22, 24.43 and 19.27 kg respectively, compared to 16 birds/m2 at 13.53 kg (P&gt;0.05). Broilers in the bamboo slats floor had lymph weight at 3.73 g compared to the litter floor at 2.55 g (P&lt;0.05). Also, broilers in the bamboo slats had average RHL (0.65) lower than broilers in the litter floor (0.79). It could be concluded that bamboo slats best being used for broilers up to a density of 13 broilers/m2. © 2010 De Gruyter Open Ltd.

A total of 60 mixed-sexes of one day old Ross chicks were used in the experiment conducted with completely randomized design of 2 different feeding times after hatching, i.e.: T1: given access to feed and water ad libitum immediately after hatching until 35d of age; and T2: withheld from feed (fasted) but not from water for 48h after hatching and then fed ad libitum until d35. The birds were weighed at the start of experiment and weekly thereafter, and DWG was then calculated. Feed intakes and FCR were also recorded weekly. At d36, abdominal fat was taken out from 2 birds per pen and was weighed. Breast meat (skinless) from the same birds was also sampled for total FA analysis. Final BW (d35) and total feed consumption of earlyfasted birds were 1935.17±43.90 kg and 2745.55±47.48 kg and those of unfasted birds were 2019.00±50.85 kg and 2910.84±128.10 kg, respectively. FCR of early-fasted and unfasted birds at d35 were 1.42±0.03 and 1.45±0.07. The magnitude difference of DWG between early-fasted and unfasted birds was 27% at d7, whereas at d35 the difference was only 4.5%. Abdominal fat percentage to live BW of early-fasted birds was 1.65±0.09% (male) and 1.60±0.10% (female) and that of unfasted birds was 2.00±0.19% (male) and 1.89±0.38% (female). Total FA contained in meat of early-fasted and unfasted birds were 0.82±0.10 and 0.85±0.10 g/100gDM. Overall, BW and feed consumption of early-fasted birds were significantly lower (P>0.05) than unfasted birds. DWG, FCR, abdominal fat and total FA contained in meat were not significantly different (P<0.05) between early-fasted and unfasted birds. In conclusion, holding birds without feed following hatch (under practical conditions) may limit the compensatory growth capacity of birds in the later age. Fasting applied in the very early life of broiler leads to impairment of cell hyperplasia resulting in permanent stunting. Abdominal fat and total FA contained in meat might not be affected by fasting for 48h after hatching. The degree or duration of feed withholding (for 48h after hatching) might not sufficient to reduce adipocyte proliferation or the number of precursor adipocytes. © 2010 De Gruyter Open Ltd.

Data were collected from 124 birds that reared under intensive management. The results showed that artificial pair was 100% and polygamy was 16% (n=62 pair of pigeon). The ration of local pigeon consisting of 50% corn+50% of commercial feed for starter broiler chicken can be applied in field. The average of egg production was 1.8 eggs/pair/period, egg weight was 17.7 g, fertility was 96.6%, hatching rate was 77%, embryo mortality rate was 23%, interval period from laying to hatching and suckling was 51 days, 31.4 days with hatching, and 17.6 days without hatching and suckling. The day old pigeon weight ranged 10.9-16.2 g. Repeatability value of productive traits was high, in which egg weight was 0.64 and day old pigeon weight was 0.737. Repeatability of reproductive traits was low, that was fertility and hatchability was 0.12 and 0.048, respectively). The squab weight increased from week 0 to 4, then decreased in the week 5. The growth rate was highest at the week 1, then decreased from the week 2 to 5 with the negative growth rate occur at the 5 th week. The squab growth rate followed a quadratic pattern. It was concluded that slaughter squab selection could be done at 4 th week old. © 2010 De Gruyter Open Ltd.

The muscle tissue of round meat of goat was separated from fat and connective tissue manually and then was cut into 3 cm size of meat for mincing by using meat mincer. Then, the minced meat was washed three times by using chilling water (5-10†C) which the final washing used chilled 0.5% NaCl solution. The ratio of water to minced meat in washing was 3:1. The final step was dewatering by pressing washed minced meat in the screen of linen mesh manually. Finally, raw surimi was stirred with sucrose 3% (P1), 4% (P2) and 5% (P3) and added sodium tripolyphosphate 0.2% for each treatment. The result showed that both pH and Water Holding Capacity (WHC) increased significantly from P1 (P<0.05), whereas the gel strength was no different. The incline of WHC was followed by the incline of crude protein content. However, sucrose could not affect ash and fat content as well as salt-soluble protein. Sucrose supplementation at 4% in goat surimi produced the best characteristics of goat surimi. © 2010 De Gruyter Open Ltd.

Its ability to initiate infection depends on the surface character of the bacteria. The surface character of S. aureus is determined by the corelation of red blood cell hemagglutination activity, hydrophobicity, production of protein A, and bacterial adherence to the mammary epithelial cells of the host. This research was designed to characterize the surface of S.aureus, which correlates to bacterial adherence. Four isolates of S. aureus were taken from subclinical mastitis milk of dairy farm in Malang, East Java. The surface character of S.aureus was determined by performing the red blood cell hemagglutination test using the dairy cow erythrocyte suspension with concentration of 0.5%, 1%, and 2%. The hydrophobicity expression was determined by Salt Aggregation Test (SAT) method using the Ammonium Sulfate suspension with concentration of 1.2 M, 1.6 M, 2.0 M, 2.4M, and 3.2 M. Serum soft agar (SSA) test was used to indicate the production of protein A; Ability of adhesion was done by adhering the S.aureus, which were already labelled by Fluorescent Ichtiocyanate (FITC) to the mammary epithelial cell of post-calving mice. Result of this this research showed that the surface characters of S.aureus, which correlates to the adherence, comprise of erythrocytes hemagglutination ability, hydrophobicity, and protein A production. Isolates of S.aureus, which is hydrophobic, possess haemagglutinine, and protein A were able to adhere to mammary epithelial cell with higher quantity. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

Allotted in 18 pens, the total of 90 Ross day old chicks were assigned in completely randomized design by 3 of dietary treatments (T1: control (basal diet without enrichment of Chlorella sp.); T2: basal diet enriched with 5-g Chlorella sp./kg feed; T3): basal diet enriched with 10-g Chlorella sp./kg feed. At d-36, skinless breast meat was collected for FA determination. Practical standard of vaccination was performed to activate antibodies production and at d-36 gut mucosa was collected for sIgA analysis. Chlorella sp. administration had no significant effect (P>0.05) on the FA profile of breast muscle, mucosal sIgA concentration and producton index of broiler. In conclusion, the level and ratio between n-3 to n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) as well as the nature of dietary PUFA source determine tissue PUFA composition. Beside through eicosanoid, Chlorella sp. may affect mucosal sIgA production through cytokines mediated effect. Although Chlorella sp. administration does not improve the production index of broiler, this treatment may produce broiler meat with lower fat content. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

Randomized Block Design with Factorial was used in this experiment with the first factor was 3 levels of restricted feeding treatment where the amount of feed as follow: P1= 100 % from the total feed requirement, P2 = 80% from total feed requirement and P3 = 60% from the total feed requirement. Feed was given in the amount of rabbits requirement, in which 100% of the total requirement was calculated based on body weight (6.7% of body weight in dry matter basis), and second factor was 3 levels of slaughter age (U1= 120 d, U2= 150 d, U3 = 180 d) and each treatment was repeated 6 times. The data were analyzed by Anova, and analyzing between the treatments used Contrast Orthogonal. The variable measured were pelt production (weight pelt, width pelt, thickness dermis and epidermis) of Rex rabbit. There was an interaction betwen slaughtered age and the amount of feed given to Rex rabbits. Feeding 80% from the total feed requirement and the slaughtered age at 150 d were the most efficient in producing pelt of Rex rabbits, with weight 261.0 ± 30.33 g, width 928.0 ± 75.5 cm2, and epidermal thickness 32.50 ± 1.1μ, and dermis 2685.50 ± 15.0 μ. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

The total number of twenty day-old male chicks consisted of DOCs Cobb 500 broiler line as a control group and those of Pelung and the crossbred of Pelung and Cemani chicks with the average body weight of 30 gram as materials. They were divided into four groups, in which each group has 5 male DOC's. Group 1 was DOCs from parent of Cobb 500 broiler as the control; Group 2 was DOCs from parent of Pelung; Group 3 was crossbred DOCs from male parent Cemani line and female parent Pelung line; and Group 4 was crossbred DOCs taken from male parent of Pelung and female parent of Cemani. Chick body weight of each group was measured at 7th week. Histological process was carried out on five DOCs of each group previously raised until seven weeks old and at the end of experiment all chicks were euthanized for pancreatic organs, particularly tissue samples of pancreas, made as histological preparates. Data from the histological probe on total pancreatic β-cell number was statistically analyzed using the ANOVA of One Way Classification, and then followed by the LSD-test. Result of the study showed that average body weights of DOCs in the control group of Cobb 500 (2770±58.31) significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) compared to the groups of 2, 3, and 4 (652.4±32.77, 570.4±14.45, and 628±37.2 g, respectively). Total pancreatic β-cell number in the control group of Cobb 500 broiler chicks (2.76x106±0.20x 106) significantly higher compared to the groups of 2, 3, and 4 (1.93 x106±0.34 x106, 1.64x106±0.30x106, and 1.71 x106±0.19 x106, respectively). The results of this study revealed that total pancreatic β-cell number can be used as an indicator of the growth and development of chick. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

The research was conducted to evaluate growth characteristic and its nutritive value of Indigofera arrecta planted on different planting spaces and different levels of NPK fertilizer dose. Two factors experiments were assigned in a Split-Plot Design. The first factor (A) was planting space, (1) 50x50 cm and (2) 75x75 cm. The Second factor (B) was level of fertilizer dose, (1) 0 kg P2O5/ha+100kg K2O/ha, (2) 100kg P2O5/ha +100kg K2O kg/ha and (3) 200kg P2O5+100kg K2O/ha. The results showed that planting space had no effect on height of plant (P&gt;0.05) but diameter of stem were statistically different (P&lt;0.05). In addition, their dry matter yield and crude protein content were not different (P&gt;0.05) on either planting space or P fertilizer dose. There were no interaction between planting space and P fertilizer dose. In addition, there were no effects either planting space or P fertilizer dose on dry matter edible part, crude protein content, and plant height. Indigofera arrecta planted on wider planting space produce bigger stem diameter and bigger number of branch. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

The need to enhance the local production of carabaos will help local farmers to increase their income. Thus, producing thorough breeds of carabaos and improving it genetically is the best response to these constraints. This study was conducted to present the feasibility study of establishing an Artificial Insemination (AI) Center and its planned area of operation in Brgy. San Juan, Ildefonso, Bulacan. The market, production, organizational and financial viability of operating the business would also be evaluated. This particular study will provide insights in establishing an AI Center. Included in this study is the identification of anticipated problems that could affect the business and recommendation of specific courses of action to counteract these possible problems. Primary data were obtained through interviews with key informants from the Philippine. Carabao Center (PCC). To gain insights about the present status of an AI Center, interviews with the technicians of PCC and private farm were done to get additional information. Secondary data were acquired from various literatures and from San Ildefonso Municipal Office. The proposed area would be 1,500 square meters that would be allotted for the laboratory and bullpen.

A Completely Randomized Design was used in this study. Data were analyzed by variance of analysis, and followed by Duncan's Multiple Range Test The treatments were : T0 = control feed (without expired bread meal), T1 = corn substituted with 10% expired bread meal, T2 = corn substituted with 20% expired bread meal, T3 = corn substituted with 30% expired bread meal and T4 = corn substituted with 40% expired bread meal. The result indicated that corn substituted with expired bread meal up to 40% has not significantly affected on carcass weight, carcass percentage and feed conversion, but decreased significantly on feed consumption and body weight gain. It can be concluded that the use of expired bread meal 30% of the proportion of corn produced the most optimal broiler performance.

Sheep rumen fluid was used as enzyme source and inoculant, whereas carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) was used as the substrate. There were 4 levels of KSO supplementation as treatment, i.e. : 0% (T0), 5% (T1), 10% (T2), and 15% (T3). Two measured variables were reduced sugar production rate and gas fermentation production. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance in completely randomized design. The result showed that reduced sugar production rate in T0, T1, T2 and T3 treatment groups were 2.58; 2.93; 2.08 and 1.58 mg/g CMC/minute, respectively, whereas gas production were : 15.97; 13.26; 10.54 and 7.57 mg/g CMC, respectively. Kapok seed oil supplementation up to 5% DM of cellulose substrate (CMC) did not influence the ruminal cellulolytic enzyme activity.

Birds were fed using blended summit (247.91g/kg CP, 3200 kcal of ME /kg) and dilution (166.26 g/kg CP, 3200 kcal of ME g/kg) diets and offered to 2-4 or 8 phases. Two hundred male day-old broiler chicks of two commercial strains (A=Ingham and B = Steggles) were used. The predicted responses were greater than the observed both gain (g/d) and feed intake (g/d). The discrepancy between the observed and predicted gain in the strain A and B birds, showed a different pattern, with a marked difference during the early growing period, with a degree of convergence in the late growing period for the strain A but the reverse picture for the strain B. This shows that strain characterization is not accurate due to an inadequate definition of the genotypes by the model. Non agreement between predicted and determined gain and feed intakes provided little benefit in moving towards a more frequent change in diet to accommodate predicted growth-related changes in amino acid requirements. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

A factorial completed random design was used in this study. The first factor was type of grass, these were king grass (Pennisetum hybrid), napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum), panicum grass (Panicum maximum), setaria grass (Setaria sphacelata) and star grass (Cynodon plectostachyus). The second factor was salt solution (NaCl) with concentration 0, 100, 200 and 300 mM. Parameters of this experiment were the percentage of chlorophyll, rate of photosynthesis, number of tiller, biomass and dry matter yield. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance and followed by Duncan's multiple range test when there were significant effects of the treatment. Panicum grass had the highest chlorophyll content (1.85 mg/g of leaf). Photosynthesis rate of setaria grass was the lowest. The increasing of NaCl concentration up to 300 mM NaCl reduced chlorophyll content, rate of photosynthesis, tiller number, biomass yield and dry matter yield. Responses of leaf area, biomass and dry matter yield to salinity were linear for king, napier, panicum and setaria grasses. In tar grass, the response of leaf area and biomass ware linear, but those of dry matter yield was quadratic. The response of tiller number to salinity was linear for all species. © 2010 Diponegoro University.

A 4 x 3 Factorial Design was applied in this study. The first factor was 4 types of E. coli isolates that collected from native chicken (C), young cattle (A), piglet (B1) and pig (B2), while the second factor was 3 concentrations of CSO extract, that was 50.00, 25.00 and 12.50 percents. Fifteen micro liters of CSO extract was dropped in sterile paper disks. These disk were laid on the MEU agar media previously inoculated with each of the four isolates and were incubated overnight at 37°C. The bacterial growth inhibition zones were observed and measured. The results demonstrated that the higher concentration of the CSO extracts, the higher bacterial growth inhibition effects obtained. Fhe growth inhibition effects of the CSO extracts on E. coli isolates C, A, B1 and B2 were significantly different at P<0.05. It could be concluded that the CSO extracts were effective to control the E. coli growth. © 2009 Diponegoro University.

This research was expected to establish the efficient feeding level to produce high growth rate and meat quality of ram in tropical environment. Sixteen rams with different body weight (BW) were divided into 2 groups, i.e. light BW (10 + 1.47 kg) and heavy BW (18 + 1.18 kg). The experimental design was Split Plot design with two factors. The main plot was body weight (light and heavy) and the sub plot was level of feeding (FL, 1x maintenance and 1.5 x maintenance). The parameters measured in this experiment were live weight gain and body composition. The results of this study showed that body water, body protein and body fat were significantly higher (P<0.01) in heavy body weight (HBW) than those in light body weight (LBW), and was higher in 1.5xM than those 1xM. Ram of HW and LW had similar change rate of physical composition. Ram given 1.5xM had higher rate of change of body fat and body water than those given feed at maintenance level. It can be concluded that there was no interaction between BW and FL on the change of body water, body protein and body fat. Ram of HBW and LBW had similar rate of change of physical composition. Level of feeding affected body water content, the higher level of feeding resulted in fatter ram, leading to less body water content. © 2009 Journal of the Indonesian Tropical Animal Agriculture.

The cooperative's business activity includes also meat shop, granting of production loan, micro-finance, mobilization of saving deposits, aside from feed milling and hog fattening. Different agencies, industry organizations and private institutions provide trainings, seminars, assistance, as well as credit for the cooperative.The aims of the study was to determine the present and discuss a noteworthy business issue (s) of Luntian Multipurpose Cooperative, evaluate the business environment prevailing at a particular time of this case, assess the cooperative's performance in terms of the four business functions, define the problem relevant to the business issue(s) being studied. The study used primary and secondary data. Primary data were gathered through interviews with the key personnel, managers, and other informants of the Luntian Multipurpose Cooperative in order to obtain responses regarding the overall status of the cooperative including its problem and plans. Secondary data were taken from files and documents, especially the history, background information and financial statements. Other data were taken through research materials such as book, unpublished special problems and from some government institutions. The recommendation of this research showed that Luntian MPC should engage in establishing a communal farm as to become the primary source of hybrid piglets that their members would raised. The alternatives solution was establishing a breeding farm that would ask for initial investment. © 2009 Journal of the Indonesian Tropical Animal Agriculture.

The experiment was designed to evaluate macro nutrient uptake (Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium) of forage grasses at different NaCl concentrations in growth media. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse at Forage Crops Laboratory of Animal Agriculture Faculty, Diponegoro University. Split plot design was used to arrange the experiment. The main plot was forage grasses (Elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum ) and King grass (Pennisetum hybrida)). The sub plot was NaCl concentration in growth media (0, 150, and 300 mM). The nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) uptake in shoot and root of plant were measured. The result indicated increasing NaCl concentration in growth media significantly decreased the N, P and K uptake in root and shoot of the elephant grass and king grass. The percentage reduction percentage of N, P and K uptake at 150 mM and 300 mM were high in elephant grass and king grass. It can be concluded that based on nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium uptake, elephant grass and king grass are not tolerant to strong and very strong saline soil. © 2009 Journal of the Indonesian Tropical Animal Agriculture.

Thirty six male Arab chicken of seven weeks old were divided into two groups, each group consisted of three cages with six chicken in each group. Two types of ration consisted of Ration One (Par-S + corn) containing 2904 kcal ME and 17 % CP, and Ration Two (BR II) containing 3100 kcal ME and 19% CP. The chicken were raised for seven weeks, weekly weighed, and randomly taken for slaughter at 12 and 14 week old. The data collected were performances and carcass characteristics of the chicken. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance of completely randomised design. The results showed that the chicken fed BR II consumed more protein and energy (483.7 g CP and 7868.8 kcal ME) compared to the chicken fed BR I (444.0 g CP and 7586.1 kcal ME). Besides, the chicken fed BR II produced heavier final body weight (1142.5 g) than the chicken fed with BR I (1048.6 g) (P < 0,05). Type of ration affected the tenderness of chicken. Slaughter age influenced carcass weight and carcass physical composition of the chicken (P<0.05). Slaughter age affected the physical characteristic of meat. It could be concluded that male Arab chicken fed ration containing higher CP and ME (higher feed density) consumed more protein and energy, and finally had heavier final body weight. Slaughter age influenced carcass weight, carcass physical composition and meat characteristics of the male Arab chicken. © 2009 Journal of the Indonesian Tropical Animal Agriculture.

One hundred and forty four sexed doc from each strain (Cobb =A, Ingham = B and Steggels = C) were divided into a factorial arrangement (three dietary protein, two sexes and three strains). Two regimens of composite mixes of a summit and dilution diet and a free choice between these two diets. Diets were changed weekly, with notional crude protein levels at one day-old of 240g/kg for all chickens, and at 42 days of age of 120 or 180 g/kg in the low and high protein. Protein utilization efficiency (PRE) was measured from 39-42 d of age. PRE increased with the increasing of dietary protein in strains A and C and had much higher response than in strain B. The moisture: protein ratios were 2.51, 2.65 and 2.58 in strains A, B and C, indicating strain B contained higher moisture and body fat and less protein.
