The meaurement of farmer's commitment indicators are done by likert scale. The result indicated that farmers in Peri-urban area of Yogyakarta have low commitment in maintaining wetted land ownership status. Low level of farmer's commitment are reflected from the low commitment to prevent the desire to sell the wetted land, to rent out the wetted land for non-agricultural use and to change the wetted land for non-agricultural use.

The Prokasih has been considered successful because the pollutant concentrations in these segments have decreased. This study examines the Prokasih from the perspective of ordinary people. The study evaluates their perception of the easily observable characteristics of specific segments of three rivers participating in the Prokasih. These rivers are located in Jakarta, and they are the Ciliwung, Cipinang, and Mookervart rivers. The target respondents were the people living in close proximity to these rivers. Two important findings emerge from this study. First, people residing close to Ciliwung, Cipinang, and Mookervart rivers believe that, with regard to physical characteristics such as odor, color, mud (sediments), turbidity, suds (foam), trash, and flow, the river's conditions have worsened, even after the implementation of the Prokasih. Second, the majority of the people who reside along the three rivers and who are familiar with the Prokasih believe that the Prokasih has not played any positive role in preserving the river quality. From the two findings just mentioned, it can be concluded that river communities might not feel the benefits of a clean river program that is successful in lowering the technical parameters of water pollution, such as coliform, BOD, and COD.",,"developing country; pollution control; programme evaluation; residents' perception; river pollution; water quality; Indonesia, Java, Jakarta",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00249521,,,,"English",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031395849

Organic matter decline indicates that the rate of humus decomposition in plantation soil is greater than that of humus addition. The decline in the nutrients is mainly due to leaching losses, nutrient immobilisation in the standing biomass, nutrient loss via harvested palm fruits and a destabilisation of the nutrient cycle due to loss of biodiversity.

The techniques can be categorized into two major types, ie urban and rural (urban-rural) orientation. Indonesian urban sprawl can be distinguished into two models, ie the Java and Outer Islands model. Java model is characterized by leap-frog (see for example Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Surakarta, Surabaya) and ribbon development (see for example Padang in Sumatra, Banjarmasin in Kalimantan, Kendari in Sulawesi). The physical, social, historical background are responsible for these conditions. The urban-rural oriented strategy is highly recommended for managing and controlling urban land growth on the island of Java whereas urban oriented techniques are suggested for managing and controlling urban land development on the outer islands. -Author",,"developing country; historical background; literative review; management technique; urban area; urban growth management; urban planning; urban sprawl; Indonesia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00249521,,,,"English",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025523684

Data were collected from secondary and primary data. The primary data were obtained through observation, in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions. The results show that the utilization of space in the anticipation of the lahar flood disaster is still limited to the construction of an elevated levee. Research findings suggest attention should be brought to the utilization of space related to vulnerable groups. In addition, public participation, preparation of design toward ecotourism and economic value, integration of risk analysis, and spatial distribution of risk should be aggregated into a detailed spatial plan. © 2016 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Disaster Prone Areas; Riverbank; Spatial Analysis; Spatial Planning",,,,,,,,"Integrating disaster risk management into urban management (2013) Disaster Risk Management Practitioner's Handbook Series, , ADPC Bangkok; Alshehri, S.A., Rezgui, Y., Li, H., Public perception of the risk of disasters in a developing economy: The case of Saudi Arabia (2013) Nat Hazards, 65, p. 1813. , (2013); Bird, D.K., Gisladóttir, G., Residents' attitudes and behaviour before and after the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruptions - A case study from southern Iceland (2012) Bulletin Volcanology, 74, pp. 1263-1279. , Springer-Verlag 2012; Cronin, S.J., Gaylord, D.R., Charley, D., Alloway, B.V., Wallez, S., Esau, J.W., Participatory methods of incorporating scientific with traditional knowledge for volcanic hazard management on ambae island, Vanuatu (2004) Bulletin Volcanology, 66, pp. 652-668; Damiania, M.L., Groppellib, G., Norinic, E., Bertinoa, A., Nucitaa, G.A., A lava flow simulation model for the development of volcanic hazard maps for mount etna (Italy) (2006) Computers & Geosciences, 32, pp. 512-526. , Elsevier; Fleischhauer, Greiving, Wanczura, Spatial planning in the focus of hazard and risk assessment/Management in Europe (2005) EURO-RIOB Conference, , Wroclaw 19-21 X 2005 Exchange of experiences connected with flood prevention; Fleischhaurer, M., The role of spatial planning in the strengthening urban resilience (2008) Resilience of Cities to Terrorist and Other Threats, , H.J.

Recently, the doline ponds are facing various environmental problems, i.e. steadily decreasing water storage, water loss, and degrading water quality. The research aims to determine the characteristics of Jonge Telaga which include the continuity of flow, utilization, pollution sources, physical water quality (temperature, EC, TDS, TSS, and turbidity), chemical water quality (pH, NO2, NO3, NH4, PO4, BOD, COD, and detergent), and biological water quality (total coliform). In order to determine the characteristics of Jonge Telaga, the research was conducted using a survey method, i.e., observing the continuity of flow and measuring physical, chemical, and biological water quality. Initially, the water was sampled purposively based on the area and the depth of this doline pond. The qualitative description of the results shows that Jonge Telaga is a closed perennial doline pond, whose main pollution source comes from domestic activities, such as bathing and washing. According to the Governor Regulation of the Special Region of Yogyakarta Number 20 Year 2008 on Water Quality Standards, Jonge Telaga meets all of the water quality criteria, except the temperature and detergent, for a Class II water. © 2016 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Doline; Doline pond; Karst; Water consumption; Water quality; Water resources; Water storage",,,,,,,,"Alaerts, Santika, S.S., (1984) Metoda Penelitan Air, , Penerbit Usaha Nasional, Surabaya.(In bahasa Indonesia); (2008) Peraturan Gubernur Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta Nomor 20 Tahun 2008 Tentang Baku Mutu Air di Provinsi DIY, , BLH BLH Propinsi DIY, Yogyakarta.

Because of the low level of food production and its fluctuation with severe climatic conditions, agricultural and pastoralist economic sectors are at a risk. The displacement of small-scale or peasant farmers and pastoralist by public agricultural and nonagricultural schemes in regard to social stress and food production is outlined. This examination moves away from the point of view that holds the peasant farmers and pastoralist responsible for famine and consequently food insecurity. The impact of the structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) on food production and security and social constraints is elucidated. The paper recommends that only a benign and effective political context is capable of pre-empting the emergence of social stress and hence may prevent it from drastically damaging food security. Such a context should not only be struggled for by the peasant farmers and pastoralists, but also by all those individuals and institutions interested to contributing to food self-sufficiency and security in the arid and semi-arid environments of Africa. -Author",,"agricultural policy; arid area; arid lands; developing region; food security; policy implication; social stress; structural adjustment programme; Africa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00249521,,,,"English",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029483443

The geo-database water quality parameters were created in Geographical Information System. Further, the kriging a geo-statistical method of interpolation is applied to know the health of groundwater in non-sampled area. This interpolation method has been used to predict spatial distribution physico-chemical parameters in the form of contour. Local planners and policymakers may utilize these results for efficient management of groundwater resources in this area.parameters in the form of contour.

It uses an experimental study that adopts Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Accuracy Assessment in reducing data dimensions and enhancing image visualization for onward classification into landcover classes using 1987 TM, 2002 ETM+ and ETM+ 2011. The 2011 ETM+ was later excluded due to scan line and cloud cover errors. The PCA results show that 1987 Bands of 145 has variance of 834.71 (88.09% of total components) while the 2002 Bands of 147 has variance of 1287.21 (85.344% of total components). Supervised classification results show overall accuracy of 96.19% (for 1987) and 96.30% (for 2002) respectively. The study reveals that there was increase in urban landcover (17.2% to 34.93%) and swamp (10.11% to 11.61%). Correspondingly, light vegetation and thick vegetation decreased from 41.76% to 27.38% and 26.31% to 22.36% while water also reduced from 4.63% to 3.73%. The study indicates a higher demand for urban settiement which requires landuse control to avoid urban blight and environmental decay. © 2016 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Environment; Geographic study; Landcover; PCA Quantitative Technique; Remote Sensing",,,,,,,,"Akinbode, A., (1996) Research Methods in Geography, , Ekpoma, Edo State University Publishing House; Balsley, H.L., (1970) Quantitative Research Methods for Business and Economics, , New York, Random House; Bäring, L., Regionalization of daily rainfall in Kenya by means of common factor analysis (1988) Inernational Journal Climatology, 8, pp. 371-389. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.3370080405; Bedi, H.S., Bindra, M.M.S., Principal components of monsoon rainfall (1980) Tellus, 32, pp. 296-298. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2153-3490.1980.tb00956.x; Berry, B.J.L., A note concerning methods of classification (1958) Annals of Association of America Geographers, 48 (3), pp. 300-303; Cassell, C., Symon, G., Qualitative research in work contexts (1994) Qualitative Methods in Organizational Research, pp. 1-13. , C.

The internal dimention was measured based on subak capability index in implementing Tri Hita Karana (THK) philosophy. The external dimention was measured by using index of four variables, namely: road density, population density, social economic facilities, and number of nonfarmer families. The data were analyzed using descriptive quantitative technique and spatial analysis using Geographical Information System (GIS) software. The results found three zones of subak sustainability type, spatially follows the principle of distance decay of the growth of tourism and city center. Unsustainable - less sustainable subak zone dominates short distance zone, sustainable - less sustainable subak zone dominates transitional zone, while sustainable subak zone dominates long distance zone. To protect subak from destruction, less sustainable subaks have to be restored into sustainable ones and the sustainable subaks should be made eternal/exclusive subaks. © 2015 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Spatial zonation model; Subak sustainability type",,,,,,,,"Alit Artha, W., Wayan, I., Lorenzen, R.P., Lorenzen, S., Past, present and future-perspectives of balinese rice farming (2006) Sumar No, Suparyono, Achmad M.

The limited land resources implies the need of effective land use planning. The objective of this study was to assess land suitability for brackish water shrimp ponds, which then will be recommended for pond development in the north coast of Tuban, Indonesia. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) were used to obtain the weight of the different criteria consisted of soil characteristics, topographic, water quality, and infrastructure criteria. The suitable land for brackish water shrimp ponds was determined by weighted overlay in GIS. The results show that the study area contains highly suitable land for brackish water shrimp ponds. Land use and land cover map was interpreted from 2014 SPOT 5 imagery. The area recommended for brackish water shrimp pond was delineated by taking into account the suitability and the constraints of land use and land cover. © 2015 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","AHP; Coastal area; GIS; Land availability; Land suitability; Remote sensing",,,,,,,,"Akinci, H., Ozalp, A.Y., Turgut, B., Agricultural land use suitability analysis using GIS and AHP technique (2013) Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 97, pp. 71-82. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2013.07.006; Ambarwulan, W., (2010) Remote Sensing of Tropical Coastal Waters: Study of the Berau Estuary, , East Kalimantan, Indonesia (Unpublished doctoral dissertation), University of Twente, Netherlands; Aronoff, S., (1989) GIS a Management Perspective, , Ottawa, Canada: WDL Publications; (2015) Indonesia's Geography, , http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/indonesia/progeography.htm; Avnimelech, Y., Ritvo, G., Shrimp and fish pond soils: Processes and management (2003) Aquaculture, 220, pp. 549-567. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0044-8486(02)00641-5; Bah, Y., Tsiko, R.G., Landfill site selection by integrating geographical information systems and multi-criteria decision analysis: A case study of Freetown, Sierra Leone (2011) African Geographical Review, 30 (1), pp. 67-99; Banerjea, S.M., Water quality and soil condition of fish ponds in some states of India in relation to fish production (1967) Indian Journal of Fisheries, 14, pp. 113-144; Boyd, C., Zimmermann, S., Grow-out systems water quality and soil management (2000) Freshwater Prawn Culture: The Farming of Macrobrachium Rosenbergii, pp. 221-238. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9780470999554.ch14, M.

The results showed that 25.4 percent of lands in Yogyakarta is highly suitable for rice, while only 16 and 2 percent, respectively, is suitable for groundnut and corn. The limiting factors to the land suitability for these three commodities were plant roots condition, nutrients availability, nutrient retention, and soil condition.

The few geographic studies on RTAs in Nigeria are limited to their mere spatial distribution and associated risk factors, with very little attention given to their spatial clustering patterns and the detection of hotspots. With the aid of Global Moran's I and Local Getis, the study found some evidence of significant positive spatial autocorrelation, and consistent clustering of RTAs, RTIs and RTDs in the southwest from 2002 to 2007 which suggested the presence of an accident belt in the southwestern region, which has been accounted by poor road infrastructure, relatively high level of economic development and high vehicular movements. The study recommends the deployment of road safety officials to the accident belt, strict enforcement of safety belts and helmets, and periodic road maintenance. © 2015 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Accident belt; G.I.S.; Nigeria; Poor road infrastructure; Road traffic accidents; Spatial autocorrelation",,,,,,,,"Aderamo, A.J., Spatial pattern of road traffic accident causalities in Nigeria (2012) Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences, 3 (2), pp. 61-71; Akinyemi, Y.C., Road transportation in Nigeria: Issues And public policy (2012) Ibadan Journal of the Social Sciences., 19 (1), pp. 16-30; Andersson, T.K., Kernel density estimation and K means clustering to profile road accidents hotspots (2009) Accident Analysis and Prevention, 413, pp. 359-364; Atubi, A.O., Onokala, P.C., Contemporary analysis of variability in road traffic accidents in lagos state (2009) African Geographical Review, 28, pp. 11-41; Chidoka, O., Welcome address (2009) FRSC Annual Inaugural Lecture Series, , www.frsc.gov.ng/frsccompendium.pdf, Annual Lectures Series Monograph 1.

Color aerial photograph scaled to 1:30 000 of 1981, numerical data of Landsat satellite taken in 1985 and SPOT satellite data of August 30, 1988 were used. The photograph was interpreted manually, while the digital analysis with DIDACTIM software was applied to the Landsat and SPOT data. Barycentric supervised classification procedure was used in classifying mangrove and land use classes. Key interpretation of mangrove type was obtained by field check in 1989. Two types of mangrove (Avicennia sp and mixed mangrove) could be identified both on the aerial photograph and on the SPOT data. The extent of mangrove in 1981 was measured manually, while those in 1985 and 1988 were obtained by multiplying the number of pixel (picture element) and the spatial resolution of Landsat and SPOT respectively. During seven years (1981-1988), there were 852 ha of mangrove in the study area which have been cut. For mangrove reforestation purposes, two mangrove zonations are presented; one is based on the salinity gradient, while the other is based on the Ciloto formula. It seems that the second zonation is quite good for the study area. -Authors",,"classification procedure; colour aerial photograph; developing country; environmental change; Landsat; mangrove; mangrove disappearance; mangrove reforestation; monitoring technique; planning tool; remote sensing; SPOT; Indonesia; Java; Surabaya",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00249521,,,,"English",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026283926

Its function is mainly administrative, there is little economic dynamic, and its facilities reach only a limited part of its surrounding country.

The variation of activities dynamically change the shape of land-use or land-cover within the campus area, thus also create variations in Land Surface Temperature (LST). The LST are impacting the coziness of human activity especially when reaches more than 30 oC. This study used the term Urban Heat Signature (UHS) to explain LST in different land-use or land-cover types. The objective of this study is to examine UHS as an Urban Heat Hazard (UHH) based on Universal Temperature Climate Index (UTCI) and Effective Temperature Index (ETI) in University of Indonesia. Thermal bands of Landsat 8 images (the acquisition year 2013-2015) were used to create LST model. A ground data known as Air Surface Temperature (AST) were used to validate the model. The result showed an increased level of maximum temperature during September-October since 2013 until 2014. The maximum temperature was reduced in October 2014, however it increased again in August 2015. The UTCI showed ""moderate"" and ""strong heat stress"", while EFI showed ""uncomfortable"" and ""very uncomfortable"" categories during that period. This research concluded that build up area in UI Campus highest temperature on UI campus based on UHS. Range UHS in Campus UI on 2013 (21.8-31.1oC), 2014 (25.0-36.2oC) and 2015 (24.9-38.2oC).

One of comprehensive efforts to build ecoliteracy in community since early is through Adiwiyata Program. Based on this, this study is aimed to find out how the effectiveness of Adiwiyata Program in the effort to build students' ecoliteracy in Banda Aceh. The method which is used is survey. The study is conducted in ten schools, with respondents are principal/vice principal, teachers, administrative staff and students. Data analysis is done descriptively toward independent variable and dependent variable and hypothesis test use non parametric statistic test. The result of study showed that there is positive and significant influence of school policy, curriculum implementation, school culture and school infrastructure management toward students' ecoliteracy. The findings of study is the more effective four components of Adiwiyata is implemented, the higher of students'ecoliteracy. Therefore, four components of Adiwiyata should be implemented maximally in each school, among other by strengthening Adiwiyata school team. © 2017 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Adiwiyata program; Ecoliteracy",,,,,,,,"Armawi, A., Local wisdom: A solution to surpass hedonism effects on environment pollution (2010) Indonesian Journal of Geography, 42 (2), pp. 119-128. , December 2010; Barnes, J.C., Awareness to action: The journey toward a deeper ecological literacy (2013) Journal of Sustainability Education, 5. , May 2013; Bruyere, B.L., The effect of environmental education on the ecological literacy of first-year college students (2008) Journal of Natural Resources & Life Sciences Education, 37, pp. 20-26. , 2008; Capra, F., Sustainable living, ecological literacy, and the breath of life (2007) Canadian Journal of Environmental Education, 12. , 2007; Edwards, S., Cutter-Mackenzie, A., Eco-literacy and the content-pedagogy relationship in early childhood education.

The samples of bottom surface sediments and the suspended sediment were collected at 50 stations in the estuary using grab and van dorm samplers. Oceanographic observation were also carried out at the stations. The Mesjid River Estuary receives lithogeneous sediments mainly from the Mesjid River's drainage areas which play important role on the formation of sandbar which is shown by a belt-like area (0.5-1.0 m depth) in the area off the river mouth. The sandbar might become a sandbank in 20 to 40 years later. High suspended sediment up to 354.61 mg/l indicates the river mouth receives lithogeneous sediments. Total of 926 ton/day of the sediments supplied by the river are deposited 0.024 m/year into the area. © 2017 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Bottom character; Bottom surface sediments; Sediment discharge; Sedimentation rates; Suspended sediment",,,,,,"1001a/UN.19.5.1.3/LT/2015","We express our deep gratitude to the Research Institute of Riau University, Minister of Education and Culture of Indonesia with contract number: 1001a/UN.19.5.1.3/LT/2015, for funding the present study.

The 48km single track mainline section under consideration which barely make up 1.1% of the entire narrow gauge track network of the country within a 5 year period contributed about 45% of the total National crossing accidents recorded in Nigeria. The method of investigation involved recording the individual attributes of each RLC such asgates, pedestrian traffic, car traffic light, proximity of signage to crossing, vehicular traffic as dummy variables. The regression analysis was used to measure their effect on accidents. The result indicates gates, pedestrians and the location of signage had significant impact on accidents occurrence at level crossings within Lagos metropolis. Based on the findings, enhancement of active warning systems among other recommendations was suggested as potent counter measures for RLC accident reduction. © 2016 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Accidents; Attributes; Crossing; Lagos Nigeria; Level",,,,,,,,"Afxentis, D., (1994) Urban Railway Level Crossings: Civil Engineering Working Paper, , Melbourne: Monash University; Asenime, C., Mobereola, D., Traffic behaviour at a signalised intersection in metropolitan lagos (2015) American Journal of Social Issues and Humanities, 5 (2), pp. 453-561; Atomode, T.I., Assessment of traffic delay problems and characteristics at urban road intersections: A case study of ilorin, Nigeria (2013) IOSR Journal of Humanities and Social Science, 12 (4), pp. 06-16; Badejo, B.A., Resuscitating Nigeria rail system: Strategies and options (1999) Journal of Transport Development Initiatives, 1 (1), pp. 25-39; Badejo, B.A., The Nigerian railways and socio-economic development of yoruba land: A historical perspective (2004) Perspectives on Yoruba History Culture, , Toyin Falola (ed) University of Texas, Austin Texas USA; Borowsky, A., Shinar, D., Parmet, Y., Sign location, sign recognition, and driver expectancies (2008) Transportarten Research Part F, 11, pp. 459-465; Caird, J.K., Creaser, J.I., Edwards, C.J., Dewar, (2002) A Human Factors Analysis of Highway-railway Grade Crossing Accidents in Canada, , Transport Canada, Montreal, Canada; Cairney, P., (2003) Prospects for Improving the Conspicuity of Trains at Passive Railway Crossings.

The results indicate that walking dominate modes for on-campus and commercial bus for off-campus students, while motorcycles taxi is used by few of the sample. Mode choices are influenced by a combination of socio-economic and trip factors. A key finding is extent that these variables positively affect the odds of using walk and commercial bus modes especially with reference to student residence: on and off-campus.

Logistic regressions are employed to understand factors influencing youth's decision to migrate as well as their choice of destination areas. The study findings suggest that migration preferences are determined by both the individual characteristics as well as the development level in both areas of origin and destination. It is also shown that education plays an important role in youth migration in Indonesia, not only in improving individual's capacity to migrate, but also in prompting migration to big cities. In addition, youth migrants tend to move to areas with similar characteristics or similar cultural background to their areas of origin. For most of young people, migration is considered as an attempt for gaining upward social mobility, thus the prevalence of youth migration to less developed areas is low. © 2016 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Decision-making; Destination choice; Education; Gender; Indonesia; Youth migration",,,,,,,,"Argent, N.M., Walmsley, D.J., Rural youth migration trends in Australia: An overview of recent trends and two inland case studies (2008) Geographical Research, 46 (2), pp. 139-152; Bell, M., Muhidin, S., (2009) Cross-national Comparisons of Internal Migration (UNDP Human Development Research Paper Volume 30), , New York: Human Development Report Office (HDRO), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); (1990) Penduduk Indonesia: Hasil Sensus Penduduk 1990, , Biro Pusat Statistik (BPS) Jakarta: BPS; (2000) Penduduk Indonesia: Hasil Sensus Penduduk 2000, , Biro Pusat Statistik (BPS) Jakarta: BPS; (2005) Survei Penduduk Antar Sensus 2005 (SUPAS 2005) [Data Set], , Biro Pusat Statistik (BPS) Jakarta: BPS; (2011) Migrasi Internal Penduduk Indonesia, , Biro Pusat Statistik (BPS) Jakarta: BPS; Corcoran, J., Faggian, A., McCann, P., Human capital in remote and rural Australia: The role of graduate migration (2010) Growth and Change, 41, pp. 192-220; Crivello, G., Becoming somebody: Youth transitions through education and migration in Peru (2011) Journal of Youth Studies, 14 (4), pp. 395-411; Elder, G.H., Jr., King, V., Conger, R.D., Attachment to place and migration prospects: A developmental perspectives (1996) Journal of Research and Adolescence, 6 (4), pp. 397-425; Easthope, H., Gabriel, M., Turbulent lives: Exploring the cultural meaning of regional youth migration (2008) Geographical Research, 46 (2), pp. 172-182; Fafchamps, M., Shilpi, F., Determinants of the choice of migration destination (2013) Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics, 75 (3), pp. 388-409; Faggian, A., McCann, P., Sheppard, S., Human capital, higher education and graduate migration: An analysis of Scottish and Welsh students (2007) Urban Studies, 44 (13), pp. 2511-2528; Franklin, R.S., (2003) Migration of the Young, Single and College Educated: 1995 to 2000 (Census 2000 Special Reports, CENSR-12), , Washington DC: Government Printing Office; Gabriel, M., Youth migration and social advancement: How young people manage emerging differences between themselves and their hometown (2006) Journal of Youth Studies, 9 (1), pp. 33-46; Lee, E.S., A Theory of Migration (1966) Demography, 3 (1), pp. 47-57; Magnan, M.O., Gauthier, M., Cote, S., (2007) Youth Migration in Quebec: Survey Results Obtained from Anglophones 20 to 34 Years of Age, , Montreal: Institut national de la recherché scientifique Urbanisation; McKenzie, F., (2009) Regional Youth Migration and the Influence of Tertiary Institutions, , Melbourne: Department of Planning and Community Development.

Concentration of CO ranges from 4.8 ppm at Erinlu/Molipa Roundabout to 137ppm on Sagamu/Ore Expressway. Concentrations of NO2 range from 100-662 ppb with overall average value (OAV) of 299.8 ppb, while concentration of nitrogen oxide (NO) ranges between 67-302 ppb and OAV of 166.23 ppb. SO2 had concentration ranging between 38-245 ppb and an OAV of 139.07 ppb all of which are above standard ambient air quality standards. AQI indicated very unhealthy air quality in most areas which calls for the need to establish and strengthen the health-based standard for air pollutants. © 2016 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Air pollution; Air quality index (AQI); Ijebu-Ode; Interpolation; Traffic emission",,,,,,,,"Abam, F.I., Unachukwu, G.O., Vehicular emission and air quality standards in Nigeria (2009) European Journal of Scientific Research, 1 (4), pp. 550-560; Allegrini, I., Costabile, F., A new approach for monitoring atmospheric pollution in urban environment (2002) Global Conference Building a Sustainable World, , San-Paolo; Al-Awadhi, J.M., Measurement of air pollution in Kuwait City using passive samplers (2014) Atmospheric and Climate Sciences, 4, pp. 253-271. , http://dx.doi.org/10.4236/acs.2014.42028; Banja, M., Como, E., Murtaj, B., Zotaj, A., Mapping air pollution in urban Tirana area using GIS (2010) International Conference SDI 2010 - Skopje, , 15-17.09.2010; Baumbach, G., Vogt, U., Hein, K.R.G., Oluwole, A.F., Ogunsola, O.J., Olaniyi, H.B., Akeredolu, F.A., Air pollution in a large tropical city with a high traffic density-results of measurement in Lagos, Nigeria (1995) The Science of the Total Environment, 169 (1-3), pp. 25-31; Begum, B.A., Kim, E., Biswas, S.K., Hoopke, P.K., Investigation of sources of atmospheric aerosol at urban and semi urban areas in Bangladesh (2004) Atmospheric Environment, 38 (1), pp. 3025-3038; Bellander, T., Berglind, N., Gustavsson, P., Jonson, T., Nyberg, F., Pershagen, G., Jarup, L., Using geographic information systems to assess individual historical exposure to air pollution from traffic and house heating in Stockholm (2001) Environ Health Perspect, 109, pp. 633-639. , http://ehpnet1.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2001/109p633-639bellander/abstract.html, Available Online at, Accessed 17 July 2014; Bortnick, S.M., Coutant, B.W., Eberly, S.I., Using continuous PM2.5 monitoring data to report an air quality index (2002) Journal of Air Waste Management Association, 52 (1), pp. 104-112; Brezzi, M., Sanchez-Serra, D., (2014) Breathing the Same Air?

However, there have been several recent foul cries about the negative development of recreational facilities and the abuse of the Master Plan in the FCC. The motivation for carrying out this study arose from the observation that recreational facilities in Phase 1 of the Federal Capital City Abuja are not clearly developed as intended by the policy makers and thus, the need to identify the recreational facilities in the Phase 1 of FCC and observe their level of development as well as usage. The field survey revealed that the Central Business District and Gazupe have higher numbers of recreational facilities with 45 and 56. While Wuse II (A08) and Wuse II (A07) Districts have lesser recreational facilities with 10 and 17. The field survey further revealed that all the districts in Phase 1 have over 35% cases of land use changes from recreational facilities to other use. The survey shows that over 65% of these recreational facilities are fully developed. The study also shows that just about 11% of the recreational sporting facilities were developed in line with the Abuja Master Plan in Phase 1. The study revealed that recreational facilities in Phase 1 of the FCC, Abuja has not being developed in compliance with the Abuja Master Plan. © 2016 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Compliance; Green area; Master plan; Open space; Park; Recreational facilities",,,,,,,,"Falade, B., Location of recreational facilities, parks and gardens development in the context of the Abuja master plan (1999) The Review of Abuja Master Plan, , Kalgo, M.

The representative 26 soil samples were analysed for their available trace metal concentration (DTPA), soil pH, and C-organic and soil texture. The result indicated that Fe toxicity and Zn deficient problems were encountered in both sites. Rice field in SP2 was more deficient in Zn than SP1. Site with the highest trace elements (Zn, Fe, Cu, and Cd) concentration had low soil pH and high C-organic. Acidic soil has higher solubility of metals; while high C-organic could improve the formation of dissolve organic carbon-metal binding, hence it improving the trace metals concentration in soil solution. © 2016 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Iron; Prafi; Rice field; Spatial distribution; Trace elements; Zinc",,,,,,,,"Alvim Ferraz, M.C.M., Lourenço, J.C.N., The influence of organic matter content of contaminated soils on leaching rate of heavy metals (2000) Environmental Progress and Sustainable Energy, 19 (1), pp. 53-58; Aminudin, Upaya peningkatan produksi padi sawah di kampung udapi hilir distrik prafi kabupaten manokwari (2011) Journal Penyuluhan Pertanian, 6 (1), pp. 212-220. , bahasa Indonesia; Tanah, B.P., (2009) Petunjuk Teknis Analisis Kimia Tanah, Tanaman, Air Dan Pupuk, Badan Penelitian Dan Pengembangan Pertanian Depertemen Pertanian, , bahasa Indonesia; Becker, M., Asch, F., Iron toxicity in rice-conditions and management concepts (2005) Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science, 168 (4), pp. 558-573; Bless, A.E.S., Citrate root exudation under Zn and P deficiency (2012) Journal of Tropical Soil, 17 (3), pp. 219-225; Du, L.G., Rinklebe, J., Vandecasteele, B., Meers, E., Tack, F.M.G., Trace metal behaviour in estuarine and riverine floodplain soils and sediments: A review (2008) Science of the Total Environment, 407 (2009), pp. 3972-3985; Gao, X.P., Hoffland, E., Zhang, F., Malate exudation by six aerob rice genotypes varying in zinc uptake efficiency (2009) J.

The study findings suggest that migration preferences are determined by both the individual characteristics as well as the development level in both areas of origin and destination. It is also shown that education plays an important role in youth migration in Indonesia, not only in improving individual's capacity to migrate, but also in prompting migration to big cities. In addition, youth migrants tend to move to areas with similar characteristics or similar cultural background to their areas of origin. For most of young people, migration is considered as an attempt for gaining upward social mobility, thus the prevalence of youth migration to less developed areas is low. © 2016 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Decision-making; Destination choice; Education; Gender; Indonesia; Youth migration",,,,,,,,"Argent, N.M., Walmsley, D.J., Rural youth migration trends in Australia: An overview of recent trends and two inland case studies (2008) Geographical Research, 46 (2), pp. 139-152; Bell, M., Muhidin, S., (2009) Cross-national Comparisons of Internal Migration, 30. , UNDP Human Development Research Paper.

The percent of urbanization increase from 27.8 percent in 2001 to 31.1 percent in 2011 census. The increase in the percentage of population in urban areas is because of natural growth, rural to urban migration and the reclassification of village and towns. The share of the slum population in the total urban population of the country was 18.3 percent in 2001 while in 2011 it was 17.4 percent.

It involves labor intensive, time consuming, high costs and impractical for use in large area. To answer these problems, this study aims to study accuracy and effectiveness of forest canopy density (FCD) model of Landsat for monitoring mangrove changes with large area ±2.600 hectares during periods 2002 and 2014 in Central Kalimantan. The result showed that FCD is capable to classified mangrove changes with overall accuracy 89.75%, and known that mangrove changes during approximately 12 years divided into four groups, i.e. deforested areas 11.11%, degraded areas 12.98%, regrowth areas 23.29% and not change areas 52.62%.

Landform control on the settlement distribution was analyzed from produced geomorphological and settlement maps and overlay them. The influence factors were analyzed from the results of in-depth interviews conducted in each village in the study area. The results show that the settlement in the study area is distributed in a dispersed pattern, following the presence of abandoned delta's natural levees.

The research aims at finding out how aerial photographs help in evaluating the characteristics of karst hydrology in the study area, and also to idenfity ways of preserving limestone karst topography within the study area. In this study, the researcher used remote sensing techniques with SPOT images, and panchromatic as well as infrared aerial photographs scaled at 1:50 000 and 1:30 000 respectively. Field work was also employed in primary data collection. To identify the hydroloigc potential phenomena that need to be preserved, spatial and qualitative analysis methods were used. Results indicate that hydrologic divide of the Bribin catchment area can easily be delinaeted on aerial photographs for Oya/Sambipitu formation but difficult for limestone karst formation. Landform units in karst topography were identified and delineated basing on the density of limestone hills and solution process using aerial photographs. On the other hand, hydrologic occurrences such as stream flow comes out and suddenly cuts into the cave, springs and sinkholes which appeared very clearly on the infrared aerial photographs, emerge in karst topography. Hydrologic phenomena were inferred by land slope and length of dry valley as uvalas lineament. Groundwater subsurface flow in karst topography could be traced from Tambakromo cave and its proceeds on to the Gilap cave in the southeast and finally to the Jomblang cave in the south. From this point, the flow follows three directions, that is, towards the east (Brokomo-Pricimantoro), to the south (Southern coast), and to the southwest (Bribin cave). Basing on the findings it was recommended that Oya/Sambipitu formation which is situated on the northern part of Bribin catchment be the first priority to preserve, and to be followed by spring belts and high density limestone karst hills that were found out to be recharge areas.",,"aerial photograph; catchment; hydrological cycle; karst hydrology; limestone; remote sensing; Indonesia, Yogyakarta, Bribin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00249521,,,,"English",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031422307

Partly as a result of the development implemented these tend to be concentrated in urban areas of Java, especially around the primate city of Jakarta. This inequality of development not only affected the performance of development activities but has also hindered the spread of employment opportunities to other areas, both rural and urban.

The younger colluvial layer transgresses all of these with little apparent change in general appearance, extending into relatively thick, recent valley fills.

The erosion hazard factors were directly observed in the field and through laboratory tests of soil samples originating from each mapping unit. The delineation of mapping unit is based on landform, slope class, and landuse type differences. Four landforms are delineated, i.e. colluvial footslope, dissected hills and mountainous which are developed on andesite intrusive rocks, and dissected mountain formed on andesitic breccias. Using the USLE, the units which are densely covered by vegetation are characterised by erosion hazard which varies from low to moderate class, while the units are covered by mixed gardens and dryfield are indicated by moderate to high class.

If tourism should be used to alleviate some of the biggest contemporary problems of Indonesia, namely hyperurbanisation and population pressure on Java and Bali, then more emphasis needs to be placed on regional distributive effects of tourism.

Three major river systems which are: Brahmaputra-Jamuna, Ganges-Padma and Surma-Kusiara have developed the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) floodplain, this covers 80% area of Bangladesh. These rivers carry huge sediments from upper Himalayan region during monsoon period. On the contrary, as the costal part of Bangladesh is open to the sea, so high wave actions, strong wind flow, tidal actions are prevailing here. Consequently, coastline of this part is unstable and dynamic. Coastline change dynamics is significant for disaster management, coastal planning and environmental management. Rennell's map (1776), Landsat MSS (1976) and Landsat OLI (2016) images have been used to explore the coastline using tools of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) of Geo-informatics.

This research uses Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) survey in order to identify the distribution of electrical resistivity in polluted areas. The results show that groundwater contamination has occurred in the research area, as indicated by very low electrical resistivity in aquifer zone, i.e. 3-9 Ωm. Such low electrical resistivity is caused by increased ions in groundwater as the results of leachate migrating downward into groundwater. The increased ions will trigger an increase in electrical conductivity (EC), i.e. up to 1,284 μmhos/cm, and a decline in electrical resistivity. The leachate spreads westward and northward at a depth of 6-17 m (aquifer) with a thickness of pollution between 4-11 m. The recommended landfill management model, emphasizing on leachate movement, include base lining (liner), leachate collection channel, geomembrane cap, and leachate treatment. © 2018 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Electrical Resistivity; ERT; Groundwater; Leachate; Piyungan Landfill",,,,,,,,"Chambers, J.E., Kuras, O., Meldrum, P.I., Ogilvy, R.D., Hollands, J., Electrical resistivity tomography applied to geologic, hydrogeologic,and engineering investigations at a former waste-disposal site (2006) Journal of Geophysic, 71 (6), pp. B231-B239. , hal; Okpoli, C.C., Application of 2D electrical resistivity tomography in landfill site: A case study of Iku, Ikare Akoko, southwestern Nigeria (2013) Journal of Geological Research, 2013, p. 8. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/895160; Koda, E., Tkaczyk, A., Lech, M., Osinski, P., Application of electrical resistivity data sets for the evaluation of the pollution concentration level within landfill subsoil (2017) Applied.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of asthma in Western Australia using EDA and confirmatory data analysis (CDA). Four provided variables (humidity, annual rainfall, EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and SEIFA (Socio-Economic Indexes)) have been tested to get the best relationship that underlying the asthma prevalence in Western Australia. The EDA result indicates that high level of humidity, high level of annual rain, the positive value of EVI and low level of SEIFA index are the main factors that contribute to the asthma prevalence. However, the result of CDA reveals that only low level of SEIFA that contributes to the asthma prevalence. The negative value of EVI and low level of annual rain become dominant factors in the disease. ©2018 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Asthma; Exploratory Analysis; Spatial Analysis; Western Australia",,,,,,,,"Anderson, H.R., Butland, B.K., Donkelaar, A.V., Brauer, M., Strachan, D.P., Clayton, T., Research | Children' s Health Satellite-based Estimates of Ambient Air Pollution and Global Variations in Childhood Asthma Prevalence (2012) Environ Health Perspect, 120 (9), pp. 1333-1339. , https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1104724; Andrusaityte, S., Grazuleviciene, R., Kudzyte, J., Bernotiene, A., Dedele, A., Nieuwenhuijsen, M.J., Associations between neighbourhood greenness and asthma in preschool children in Kaunas, Lithuania: A case-control study (2016) BMJ Open, 6 (4), p. e010341. , https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010341; ArcMap, D., (2017) Using Weights, , http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/tools/spatial-statistics-toolbox/using-weights.htm, Retrieved from; (2018) Thunderstorm Asthma, , https://www.australiawidefirstaid.com.au/thunderstormasthma/, Retrieved October 27, 2017, from; Black, M.H., Anderson, A., Bell, R.A., Dabelea, D., Pihoker, C., Saydah, S., Lawrence, J.M., Prevalence of asthma and its association with glycemic control among youth with diabetes (2011) Pediatrics, 128 (4), pp. e839-e847. , https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2010-3636; Bottrell, J., (2011) Here'S Why Humidity and Cold Air Trigger Asthma, , https://www.healthcentral.com/article/heres-why-humidity-and-cold-air-trigger-asthma, Retrieved from; Chien, L.-C., Alamgir, H., Geographic disparities of asthma prevalence in south-western United States of America (2014) Geospatial Health, 9 (1), p. 97. , https://doi.org/10.4081/gh.2014.8; Collison, A., Herbert, C., Siegle, J.S., Mattes, J., Foster, P.S., Kumar, R.K., Altered expression of microRNA in the airway wall in chronic asthma: MiR-126 as a potential therapeutic target (2011) BMC Pulmonary Medicine, p. 11. , https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2466-11-29; (2015) Breathe Easy: Why Controlling Humidity Can Help Reduce Asthma Symptoms, , https://learn.compactappliance.com/humidityand-asthma/, Retrieved October 25, 2017, from; Cook, A.G., Devos, A.J.B.M., Pereira, G., Jardine, A., Weinstein, P., Use of a total traffic count metric to investigate the impact of roadways on asthma severity: A case-control study (2011) Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source, 10 (1), pp. 1-8. , https://doi.org/10.1186/1476069X-10-52; Crighton, E.J., Feng, J., Gershon, A., Guan, J., To, T., A spatial analysis of asthma prevalence in Ontario (2012) Canadian Journal of Public Health, 103 (5), pp. 384-389; Cunningham, J., (2010) Socioeconomic Status and Self-Reported Asthma in Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Australian Adults Aged 18-64 Years: Analysis of National Survey Data, pp. 1-11; (2013), http://davinci.asu.edu/index.php?title=evi, evi; Delclòs-Alió, X., Miralles-Guasch, C., Jacobs, J., Land Use Policy Looking at Barcelona through Jane Jacobs' s eyes: Mapping the basic conditions for urban vitality in a Mediterranean conurbation (2018) Land Use Policy, 75, pp. 505-517. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.04.026, April; Erdman, E., Liss, A., Gute, D.M., Rioux, C., Koch, M., Naumova, E.N., (2015) Does The Presence of Vegetation Affect Asthma Hospitalizations Among The Elderly ?

The assessment employed a water quality modeling using Qual2Kw that provided not only the comprehensive values of PL and PCC but also the amount of PL that should be reduced to meet the PCC of every river segment. Water sampling and primary parameter measurement were conducted purposively in seven observation points, which included one point source and six non-point sources (river segments). River segments were determined according to the characteristics of land use and drainage system. Descriptive, graphic, and spatial analyses on water quality modeling show that the COD and BOD of Bedog River (2.24 km) indicates a small presence of PL compared to the river's PCC. The PCC allows additional pollutant loads of 566.95 kg/day or 0.024 ton/hour BOD and 22,965.12 kg/ day or 0.96 ton/hour COD. However, a high BOD in segments 3, 5, and 6 and a high COD in segment 5 imply the needs for PL reduction. © 2018 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Bedog River; Pollutant Carrying Capacity (PCC); Pollutant Load (PL); Qual2Kw",,,,,,,,"Abdi, Z., (2011) Kajian Daya Tampung Beban Pencemaran Sungai Batanghari Pada Penggal Gasiang - Sungai Langkok Provinsi Sumatera Barat, , Tesis.

Gleam combines a wide range of remotely sensed observations to estimate the terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture at a global scale (0.25-degree). The aim is to assess the accuracy of Gleam data by examining correlation, mean absolute error, Root means square error and mean error between Epan and Gleam data in Java and Bali Island. The result shows the correlation between Epan with Ep Gleam is higher than Epan with E Gleam. Generally, the accuracy of Gleam data is a good performance to estimate the land evaporation in Java and Bali at annual and monthly scale. In daily scale, the correlation is less than 0.50 both between Epan with E Gleam and between Epan with Ep Gleam. In a daily scale, the average errors ranging from 0.15 to 3.09 mm according to RMSE, MAE, and ME. The result of this study is essential in providing a valuable recommendation for choosing alternative evaporation data in a regional or local scale from satellite data. © 2018 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Bali;

Five former mining lakes were chosen: Gunung Lang, Taman Indah, Kg. Temiang, Lahat and Kg. Engku Husin. The parameters measured were pH, dissolved oxygen, suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand and ammonical nitrogen (NH3N), while the heavy metals measured were lead (Pb), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and arsenic (As). The analytical study shows that four former mining lakes in this research are suitable to be developed for water recreation purposes as they are classified under class II with a WQI greater than 81, which holds a clean status. Only one lake, Kg. Engku Husin, is categorised as class III, which requires an intensive treatment before it can be used for recreational purposes. Meanwhile, heavy metals such as Zn, As and Cu were at the standard level except for Pb, which exceeded the set guidelines. The local authorities and project developers should take appropriate measures to ensure that this former mining lake is well maintained and managed so that it is preserved and suitable to be developed as a recreational area. © 2018 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Ipoh City; Tin Mining; Water Quality",,,,,,"Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris: 2015-0113-106-01","We would like to extent our appreciation to UPSI for financing this research under Research University Grant (2015-0113-106-01).

The volcano is located in Karo District, North Sumatera Province, Indonesia, geographically on 3o10' North Latitude, and 98o23, East Longitude. It is about 2460 m high above sea level, and the highest volcano of Sumatera. Sinabung has been estimated about 400 years long inactive, therefore categorized as B type of volcano. It was astonishing; Sinabung erupted on 27 August 2010, again on November 2013, and in May to June 2015. Awakening of the volcano hypothetically has been triggered by last decade earthquakes happened in North Sumatera and surrounding area, including the great earthquake and tsunami of Aceh, December 2004 that caused about 115,000 people died. Because of the volcano has been slept for a long time, people live in the surrounding area were not prepared yet to facing the eruption. To reduce the risk, such a countermeasure should be developed especially that directly involving local people participation. In this case, such an environmental communication system is needed to be developed; it is SMS gate way for disaster early warning system. © 2018 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association","Environmental communication system; Eruption; Sleeping volcano; SMS gate way",,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research","The authors wish gratefully acknowledged to the Ministry of Research Technology and Higher Education through the Directorate of Research and Community Service for their support to this research.

It used a qualitative method with research data obtained from in-depth interviews to 22 informants including governmental agencies (7 informants), academics (6 informants), entrepreneurs (5 informants), and villagers (4 informants). The informants were sampled using purposive sampling method. Data processing and analysis were conducted using qualitative descriptive method, i.e. (1) data reduction, (2) data presentation, and (3) data conclusion. Data validation and reliability tests were conducted using source triangulation method. The results show that the stakeholders proposed various management strategies to improve the positive impacts and, at the same time, reduce the negative impacts of urban sprawl. These management strategies include (1) consistency in implementing spatial planning regulation, (2) spatial synergism in development planning, implementation, and monitoring, (3) assistance to the native people and the migrants, and (4) integration between the university and the village. © 2017 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Areas around UMY; Indications of urban sprawl; Outskirts; Regional management",,,,,,,"Author would like to express her gratitude to the Graduate School of UGM for providing research funding through the scheme of Competitive Graduate-School Lecturer Research Grant in 2016.

Thirty questionnaires were administered through a systematic sampling technique in each of the six faculties making a total of 180 questionnaires. The paper has found out a positive relationship between the student's academic performance, power supply and health facilities. However, the internet facilities and transportation facilities were not adequate, whereas water supply was adequate. A test of the impact of infrastructural facility on the student's academic performance, using a Chi Square statistical technique revealed a significant value of 177.1 at 0.05 % level. The paper recommends that the existing facilities should be upgraded and significantly improved by the government; urgent attention should be given to the development of the internet facilities and transportation sector of the University. Also, private partnership should be encouraged in the infrastructural development of the University. © 2017 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Academic performance; Infrastructural facility; Students; University",,,,,,,,"Abosedra, S., (2009) Electricity Consumption and Economic Growth: The Case of Lebanon, in Applied Energy, 86 (4), pp. 429-432; (2009) An Overview of the Infrastructure Strategy including MTS, , Africa Development Bank (ADB).

Geographically weighted regression (GWR) enables the use of the local parameter rather than the global parameter to be estimated, with the results presented in map form. The results of this study reveal that residential property values are mainly determined by the property's physical (structural) attributes, but proximity to locational attributes also contributes marginally. The use of GWR in this study is considered a better approach than other methods to examine the effect of locational attributes on residential property values. GWR has the capability to produce meaningful results in which different locational attributes have differential spatial effects across a geographical area on residential property values. This method has the ability to determine the factors on which premiums depend, and in turn it can assist the government in taxation matters. © 2017 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Geographically weighted regression; Kuala Lumpur; Location attributes; Residential property values",,,,,,,,"Ahlfeldt, G.M., Kavetsos, G., Form or function?

Indicators of agricultural drought often are precipitation, temperature and soil moisture to measure soil moisture and crop yield. This study aims to assess spatio-Temporal variations of drought in the Tihama Plain, which is one of the most important agricultural areas in Yemen, which contributes about 42% of the total agricultural production in the country. In recent years, the Tihama Plain faced changes in the rainy season, which reflect negatively on agriculture production and water security in the area. In this study, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was used to temporally evaluate the situation of drought, also used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in order to show the spatial variability distribution of drought in the study area. The analysis results of SPI-6 showed that the year of 1984, 1991, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2008 were the most affected by drought during the study period of 30 years (1980-2010). It was also shown that 1991 was the worst years of drought experienced by the study area. Based on the fact that the study area is the most important agricultural areas in Yemen, it is recommended to study the drought and its impact on agricultural crops. © 2017 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Agricultural drought; Drought indicators; GIS; Spatial distribution; Standardized precipitation index (SPI); Tihama plain",,,,,,,,"Al-Haddad, N.A., (2008) Geomorphological Study of the Phenomenon of Sand Dunes in the Area of Zabid, , (Master Thesis) Department of Geography, Sana'a University, Yemen; Statement on meteorological drought (2004) American Meteorological Society (AMS), Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 85, pp. 771-773. , AMS; Andreadis, K.M., Clark, E.A., Wood, A.W., Hamlet, A.F., Lettenmaier, D.P., Twentieth-century drought in the conterminous United States (2005) Journal of Hydrometeorology, 6 (6), pp. 985-1001; Bruns, B., Taher, T., (2009) Yemen Water User Association Study: Findings and Recommendations for a Problem-solving Approach, , Groundwater and Soil Conservation Project, Sana'a, Yemen; Ceglar, A., Zalika, C., Lucka, K.B., (2008) Analysis of Meteorological Drought in Slovenia with Two Drought Indices, , Balwois, Ohrid; Dhaifallah, A.A., (2012) Spatial Variation of Desertification in Hudeidah Governorate (Master Thesis) Department of Geography, , Thamar University, Yemen; Dracup, J., Lee, K., Paulson, E., Jr., On the definition of droughts (1980) Water Resources Research, 16 (2), pp. 297-302; Eklund, L., Seaquist, J., Meteorological, agricultural and socioeconomic drought in the Duhok Governorate, Iraqi Kurdistan (2015) Natural Hazards, 76 (1), pp. 421-441; (2005) Water Development Report 1: Vulnerability of the Region to Socio-Economic Drought, , http://www.escwa.un.org/information/publications/edit/upload/sdpd-05-9-e.pdf, ESCWA.

Therefore, geographical and spatial issues are frequently engaged and even embedded into it. Thus, this article is written with one purpose: To investigate the spatial relationship of voter turnout and their political participation. As stated earlier, the complexity of the political analysis based on geography will take us on a multidimensional approach that includes social, cultural and economy. However, this article starts the discussion from spatial analysis by using a map that illustrates the administrative boundaries of a region, then determining whether one region is adjacent to another. In this case, Moran's I is used to determine the spatial autocorrelation of voter turnout and political participation. The result indicates that the voter turnout and political participation in one region is adjacent to each other. Possible reasons for the result are discussed in this article. © 2017 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Adjacent; Democracy; Gentrification; Neighboring; South tangerang municipality; Spatial autocorrelation",,,,,,,,"Abdulbaki, L., Democratisation in Indonesia: From transition to consolidation (2008) Asian Journal of Political Science, 16 (2), pp. 151-172; Agustino, L., Yusoff, M.A., Local politic in Indonesia: Form autocratic to political reform [in bahasa] (2010) Jurnal Ilmu Politik, Edisi, 21, pp. 6-30; Anwar, D.F., Foreign policy, Islam and democracy in Indonesia (2010) Journal of Indonesian Social Sciences and Humanities, 3, pp. 37-54. , 2010; Bollen, K., Liberal democracy: Validity and method factors in cross-national measures (1993) American Journal of Political Science, 37 (4), pp. 1207-1230. , November 1993; Carter, A., Stokes, G., (2002) Democracy and Citizenship, in Democratic Theory Today: Challenges for the 21st Century, , Carter, A. & Stokes (ed), Cambridge: Polity Press; Cho, W.K.T., Gimpel, J.G., Dyck, J.J., Residential concentration, political socialization, and voter Turnout (2006) The Journal of Politics, 68 (1), pp. 156-167. , February 2006; Clinton, J.D., Lapinski, J.S., Targeted"" advertising and voter turnout: An experimental study of the 2000 presidential election (2004) The Journal of Politics, 66 (1), pp. 69-96. , February 2004; Cox, R.K., (2002) Political Geography: Territory, State, and Society, , Blackwell Publishers, Oxford, UK; Darmoval, D., The political geography of macro-level turnout in American political development (2006) Political Geography, 25, pp. 123-150; Dimitrova, D.V., Bystrom, D., The effects of social media on political participation and candidate image evaluations in the 2012 Iowa caucuses (2013) American Behavioral Scientist, 20 (10), pp. 1-15; Rhoads, E., Women's political participation in Indonesia: Decentralization, money politics and collective memory in Bali (2012) Journal of Current Southeast Asian Affairs, 2 (2012), pp. 35-56; Hadiz, V.R., Decentralization and democracy in Indonesia: A critique of neo-institutionalist perspectives (2004) Development and Change, 35 (4), pp. 697-718; Hajnal, Z.L., Lewis, P.G., Municipal institution and voter turnout in local elections (2003) Urban Affairs Review, 38 (5), pp. 645-668. , May 2003; Hidayat, S., (2007) Shadow State...?

Studies using a global model might not be sufficient to pinpoint the factors having most impact on poverty due to spatial differences. Therefore, a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) was used to analyze the factors influencing the poverty among food crops famers. Jambi Province is selected because have high number of poverty in rural area and the lowest farmer exchange term in Indonesia. The GWR was better than the global model, based on high value of R2, lowers AIC and MSE and Leung test. Location in upland area and road system had more influence to the poverty in the western-southern. Rainfall was significantly influence in eastern. The effect of each factor, however, was not generic, since the parameter estimate might have a positive or negative value. © 2017 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Food crop farmer; Geographically weighted regression; Poverty; Spatial analysis",,,,,,"Ministry of Agriculture - Saskatchewan","Thank you for Ministry of Agriculture which has funded this reseach through the scholarship program.","(2009) Kesejahteraan Petani Dan Pengentasan Kemiskinan [Internet]., , http://www.mediaindonesia.com/mipagi/read/16521/Kesejahteraan-Petani-dan-Pengentasan-Kemiskinan, ADB.

The aim was achieved by establishing crime incident spots, types of crime committed, the time it occurred and factors responsible for prevailing crime. The methods for data collection involved Geoinformatics through the use of remote sensing and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) for spatial data. Questionnaires were administered for other attribute information required. The analysis carried out in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment especially for mapping and the establishment of spatial patterns. The results indicated that the main types of crime committed were theft and house breaking (42.9%), followed by assault (12.4%), mischief (11.3%), forgery (10.5%), car snatching (9.05%), armed robbery (8.5%), trespass (5.2%) and culpable homicide (0.2%). In terms of hot spots the districts recorded the following: Garki (27.62%), Maitama (25.7%), Utako (24.3%), Wuse (20.9%) and Asokoro district (1.4%) respectively with most of the crime committed during the day time. Many attributed the crimes to mainly high rate of unemployment and poverty (79.1%). Consequently to reduce the crime rate, the socio-economic situation of the city must be improved through properly constructed interventions scheme in areas known to quickly generate employment such as agriculture, small and medium scale enterprises, mining and tourism. © 2017 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Crime incident; Crime pattern; Policing; Socio-economy; Spatio-temporal analysis",,,,,,,,"(2008) Demographic Yearbook 2005, 764p. , New York, United States; Weeks, J.R., Defining urban areas (2010) Remote Sensing of Urban and Suburban Areas.

Seagrass distribution map was produced from radiometrically and geometrically corrected Sentinel-2A image with overall accuracy of 61.9%. Using empirical model, seagrass percent cover was predicted with maximum coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.51 and standard error of estimate (SE) of 19.4%.

Methodology used is an analysis to compare the different number of islands from various sources. First, some numbers of Indonesian islands were derived from: (i) Centre for Survey and Mapping- Indonesian Arm Forces (Pussurta ABRI) recorded as 17,508 islands; (ii) Agency for Geospatial Information (BIG) previously known as National Coordinating Agency for Surveys and Mapping (Bakosurtanal) as national mapping authority reported with 17,506 islands (after loosing islands of Sipadan and Ligitan); (iii) Ministry of Internal Affair published 17,504 islands. Many parties have referred the number of 17,504 islands even though it has not yet been supported by back-up documents; (iv) Hidrographic Office of Indonesian Navy has released with numbers of 17,499; (v) Other sources indicated different numbers of islands, and indeed will imply to people confusion. In the other hand, the number of 13,466 named islands has a strong document (Gazetteer). Second, enumerating the total number of islands in Indonesia can be proposed by three ways: (i) island census through toponimic survey, (ii) using map, and (iii) applying remote sensing images. Third, the procedures of searching valid result in number of islands is by remote sensing approach - high resolution satellite images. The result of this work implies the needs of one geospatial data source (including total numbers of islands) in the form of 'One Map Policy' that will impact in the improvement of Indonesian geographic data administration. © 2017 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Island definition; Method for counting islands; Number of Indonesian islands",,,,,,,,"Abidin, Z.A., (2015) Inventarisasi Jumlah Dan Potensi Pulau-Pulau di Indonesia, Diunduh Tanggal 29 Juni 2015, Jam 14.15 Dari Situs, , http://geodesy.gd.itb.ac.id/hzabidin/?p=77, (in Bahasa Indonesia); (2015) Paradigma Geomaritim: Strategi Mewujudkan Indonesia Sebagai Poros Maritim Dunia Dalam Perspektif Geografi, Cibinong, 2015, , (in Bahasa Indonesia); (2017) Jumlah Pulau Indonesia Sebanyak 16.056 Pulau Masih Bisa Bertambah Lagi, , http://www.big.go.id/berita-surta/, (in Bahasa Indonesia); Cheung, R., Cheung, E., (1980) Modern Map Reading for Junior Secondary School, , Jin Kung Educational Press, Hongkong, 1980; Dahuri, R., (2014) Teologi Negara Maritim, Koran Sindo Senin, 4 Agustus 2014, , (in Bahasa Indonesia); (2004) Keputusan Menteri Dalam Negeri No. 109 A Tahun 2003 Tentang Data Wilayah Administrasi Pemerintahan, Direktorat Jenderal Pemerintahan Umum, Jakarta- 2004, , (in Bahasa Indonesia); (2012) Surat Edaran Kepala Dishidros Nomor SE/1241/IV/2012, Tanggal 10 April 2012 Tentang Data Wilayah NKRI, , (in Bahasa Indonesia); (2014) Pulau Indonesia Berkurang Empat Ribu, Diunduh Dari Situs, , http://www.kidnesia.com/Kidnesia2014/Dari-Nesi/Sekitar-Kita/Pengetahuan-Umum/Pulau-Indonesia-Berkurang-4-Ribu, (in Bahasa Indonesia); Karim, M., (2009) Eksistensi Pulau - Pulau Kecil di Kawasan Perbatasan Negara, Buletin Tata Ruang, Mei-Juni 2009, , Badan Koordinasi Penataan Ruang Nasional (BKPRN), Jakarta 2009.

Insufficient comprehension over these three aspects has caused delays of economic progress in several regions like Maluku. This region is characterized with archipelagic geo-profile where marine and fisheries resources are abundant but economic progress is sluggish. To catch up with the achievement shown by regions in the western part of the country, there must by effective efforts done in Maluku. This research is aimed at analyzing the three aspects mentioned above as related to acceleration of marine and fisheries economic development based on the region's maritime geo-profile. In line with it, primary and secondary data were applied on a SWOT Analytical Approach. Based on the analysis, it was concluded that acceleration of marine and fisheries economic development in Maluku can be carried out through both local and national policies focused on facilitating prospective economic players in making massive investment in the marine and fisheries sector. Among others, this should be done by improving the capacity of Maluku marine ports and directing them to be local economic transmiters, through more effective functions as hubs for ships carrying commodities and products for both national and international markets. This research found that in line with it, a pre-requirement that has to be advanced by the government is detailed zoning of marine and fisheries resources, which is supported by a legal umbrella. © 2017 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Acceleration; Economic development; Geo-maritime; Maluku; Marine and fisheries",,,,,,,,"(2015) Strategi Mewujudkan Indonesia Sebagai Poros Maritim Dunia Dalam Perspektif Geografi, , (in Bahasa Indonesia); Wangqs, C., Sociological Interpretations marine management (2003) Journal of Ocean Unoversity of China (Social Science); Djalal, H., (2014) Negara Maritim Dan/atau Negara Kepulauan?, , http://news.metrotvnews.om/read/2014/11/07/315756/negara-maritim-dan-atau-negara-kepulauan.html, 7 November 2014., (in Bahasa Indonesia); Gidden, (2000) Consequence of Moderenity.

The growth of cities is mainly due to various reasons such as the capitalization process, regional enlargement/reclassification, as well as migration from rural to urban. The growth of cities leads a lot of problems like environmental degradation, traffic congestion, poverty, crime and other social conflicts. Such a rapid rate of urbanization is a reflection of the inequity between rural and urban development. Lack of employment opportunities in the village causes the population to go into town to find work. The imbalance of development that occurs is a result of implementing a liberal economic system that only emphasizes growth, while on the other side of the agricultural sector is not paid any appropriate attention. The farmers are at a very weak and do not have a good bargaining position, with the exchange rate is very lame. The imbalances of development do not only occur between rural and urban, but also between Java and the outside of Java, and between western and eastern Indonesia regions. This imbalance should be found a solution, with good management and equitable development, including the political will to reform the economic system in favor of the Indonesian people. © 2017 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Level of urbanization; The economic system regional imbalance; The lack of employment opportunities in villages; Urban growth",,,,,,,,"Aziz, I.J., Pembangunan Daerah dan Aspek Alokasi Investasi Antardaerah (1985) Prisma, (6), pp. 3-21. , (in Bahasa Indonesia); Boeke, J.H., The Theory of Dualismin Wertheim (eds) (1961) The Concept of Dualism in Theory and Policy, pp. 165-193. , Amsterdam, W Van Hoeve Publisher Ltd; Borts, G.H., The Equalization of Returns and Regional Economic Growth (1960) American Economic Review, 50, pp. 319-347; (1982) Sensus Penduduk 1980, , (in Bahasa Indonesia); (1992) Sensus Penduduk 1990, , (in Bahasa Indonesia); (1997) Survai Antar Sensus 1995, , (in Bahasa Indonesia); (1998) Produk Domestik Bruto Indonesia, , (in Bahasa Indonesia); (2002) Sensus Penduduk 2000, , (in Bahasa Indonesia); (2005) Survai Sosial Ekonomi Indonesia, , (in Bahasa Indonesia); (2006) Survai Angkatan Kerja Nasional, , (in Bahasa Indonesia); (2007) Survai Antar Sensus 2005, , (in Bahasa Indonesia); (2008) Survai Demografi Dan Kesehatan Indonesia 2007, , (in Bahasa Indonesia); (2009) Produk Domestik Bruto Indonesia, , (in Bahasa Indonesia); (2013) Sensus Pertanian, , (in Bahasa Indonesia); Brannen, J., (1997) Memadu Metode Penelitian Kualitatif Dan Kuantitatif Terjemahan Nuktah Arfawie Kurde, Imam Syafei, Noorhadi AH.

Further data processing used USLE formula with ArcGIS program. The results showed that the potential erosion of Wae Heru Watershed and Wae Tonahitu Watershed are in very light potential class. This is because the conditions in the upstream are still forested largely. However, at the downstream potential for erosion is vary, i.e. light class, moderate class, heavy class and very heavy class.

Adaptation in community activities is to fulfill the needs by working as farmers (on the rice fields, fish ponds or salt ponds) or as the fishermen.

Effects on rain intensity, spatio-temporal variability of growing seasons, flooding, drought, and land-use change impose feedbacks at regional-local scales. Yet, empirical knowledge of associated impacts on crop yield is limited; thus, we examined the imperatives for food security in Nigeria. Bivariate correlation and multiple regression suggests impending drought in the northern region where livestock farming is predominant. Relative contributions of climate independent variables in determining crop yield by backward selection procedures with step-wise approach indexed the impacts of annual climate variability by a parameter computed as annual yield minus mean annual yield divided by the standard deviation. Results show Z-distribution approximately 5 to + 5, when < 3 or > 3 indicate impacts significant at 95% confidence levels. In conclusion, we established the interwoven relationship between climatic change and food security. © 2015 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Africa; Climate change; Food security",,,,,,,,"Acosta-Michlik, L., Kelkar, U., Sharma, U., A critical overview: Local evidence on vulnerabilities and adaptations to global environmental change in developing countries (2008) Global Environmental Change, 18, pp. 539-542; Ahmed, S.A., Diffenbaugh, N.S., Hertel, T.W., Climate volatility deepens poverty vulnerability in developing countries (2009) Environmental Research Letters, 4, pp. 1-8; Battisti, D.S., Naylor, R.L., Historical warnings of future food insecurity with unprecedented seasonal heat (2009) Science, 323, pp. 240-244; Bello, N.J., Ufoegbune, G.C., Akanni, C.O., Climatic classification approach to agricultural land use planning in ogun-oshun river basin area Nigeria (2004) Journal of Meteorological Society, 4 (1), pp. 50-62; Biasutti, M., Giannini, A., Robust sahel drying in response to late 20th century forcings (2006) Geophys.

This study examines the effects of farmer-managed practices on soil fertility in Sabke catchment of the drylands. Seven sites under permanent cropland, fallow land, grassland, shrubland, orchard land, intercropping land and woodland distributed on four transects were selected across the catchment. At every site, five replicate soil samples were collected from 0-15cm (topsoil) and 20-30cm (subsoil) and analysed for C, N, P, Ca, Mg, K and Na. Higher topsoil values of most of the properties were observed under cropland and intercropping sites. The two cultivated plots receive annual applications of organic manure in addition to chemical fertilizer and crops residue retention while the other plots are not. Thus, improvement in soil organic matter and nutrients would be expected in soils of the area with high rate of application of manure and chemical fertilizer, and retention of crop residues. © 2015 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Land; Management practices; Nutrients; Sabke catchment; Soil organic matter; Subsoil; Topsoil",,,,,,,,"Bouwman, A.F., Exchange of greenhouse gases between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere (1990) Soils and the Greenhouse Effects, pp. 61-127. , Bouwman, A.F.

Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) was used to determine vegetation assemblages, while both correlation and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to show the relationship between species in the different study sites. Results of the DCA revealed three species assemblages, an area with only forest species, another with only savanna species and a third with both forest/savanna species. ANOVA results further revealed that within the forest and savanna assemblages, species in mature and successional sites were alike. The study therefore revealed that human activities' within the region is leading to the establishment of savanna species and an elimination of forest species. © 2015 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Floristic composition; Forest-savanna boundary; Successional landuse",,,,,,,,"Adejuwon, J.O., Adesina, F.A., Vegetation patterns along the forest-savanna boundary in Nigeria (1988) Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography, 9 (1), pp. 18-31; Areola, O.O., (1991) Ecology of Natural Resources in Nigeria, 270p. , Avebury; Dezzeo, N., Chacón, N., Sanoja, E., Picón, G., Changes in soil properties and vegetation characteristics along a forest-savanna gradient in southern Venezuela (2004) Forest Ecol.

This study applied face to face interviews, targeting key informants such as the environmental experts, urbanization researchers and officials from the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA). Results show that rapid motorization, continued dependence on fossil fuels, open waste burning, biomass burning, industrialization, bushfires and urbanization are the key causes of air pollution in Uganda. To reduce air pollution and improve urban air quality it is critical to promote non-motorised mass transport, increase electricity access, regulate open waste burning, establish laboratories, strengthen local research and training capacity, promote collaborations, introduce more fuel efficient vehicles and periodic vehicle inspection and carry out public awareness campaigns about air pollution. © 2015 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Air pollution; Air quality management; Uganda; Urban air quality",,,,,,,,"Bateebe, I.P., (2011) Investigation of Probable Pollution from Automobile Exhaust Gases in Kampala City, , Uganda, Msc.

There is a river in the Aceh Besar district named ""Keuliling River"". The river is one of the watershed sub-basins of Krueng Aceh which has large enough potential of water to increase the supply of raw water in order to meet the water needs of the Banda Aceh City and Aceh Besar district. Therefore, a reservoir building was built that able to acomodate a large capacity of water. The resorvoir was named ""Keuliling Reservoir"". ""Reservoir Keuliling"" has 38.20 km2 watershed areas, 259.94 hectares wide puddle on Normal Water Front (MAN), a total of 18,359,078 m3 bin normal water level at an elevation of 45.80 m and has an effective pitcher of 12.99,208 m3. The reservoir also serves as a provider of raw water for the development of inland fisheries, livestock, rice fields and others. The greatest needs are to be served by the reservoir is water requirement for paddy planting season Rendeng in October to December and the gadu growing season from April to June. To meet all these requirements then performed the planning operation of reservoir. Ie, by optimizing the volume of water storage at the end of the month through the optimization of the use of inflow data and outflow data. The optimization performed with optimization models Linear Programming. The results of the optimization is the volume of water in reservoirs that have large water needs, which in October is 13,380,986 m3, in November is 76,640,036 m3 and in December is 38,104,116 m3. Where in each month of the above conditions are still effective volume reservoirs at 12,992,080 m3. The results showed that from month to month never happened reservoir conditions at the level of the dead reservoirs, this illustrates that Keuliling reservoir can meet the water needs of the community. © 2015 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","Debit; Linear programming optimization model; Reservoir operation; Reservoirs volume",,,,,,,,"Aminudin, (2005) Principles Operations Research, , Erlangga, Jakarta; Anonymous, (1986) Irrigation Planning Standards KP-01, , Board of Public Works Publisher, Jakarta; Anonymous, (2009) Aceh Besar in Figures, , BPS Banda Aceh; Anonymous, (2009) Profile Reservoir Keuliling Aceh Province, , Wiratman & Associates, Jakarta; (1995) Hydrology and Watershed Management, , Gadjah Mada University Press, Yogyakarta; Hadihardaja, I.K., Reliability analysis optimal operation of reservoir kaskade citarum to meet the needs of raw water, design and construction journali (2006) Vol., 5 (1); Mohammad, H., Faridah, O., Qaderi, K., Developing optimal reservoir operation for multiple and multipurpose reservoirs using mathematical programming (2015) Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2015; Ibrahim Agung, B., (2003) The Guidelines Operation Single Reservoir, , www.bintek-spm.com/download/98.pdf; Mays, L.W., Koung Tung, Y., (1992) Hydro Systems Engineering and Mangement, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Siswanto, (2006) Operations Research, , Jilid 1, Erlangga, Jakarta; Soewarno, (1995) Hydrology Measurement and Watershed Data Management, , (Hidrometri), Nova, Bandung; Srivastava, D.K., Patel, I.A., Optimization-simulation models for the design of an irrigation project (1992) Water Resources Management Volume, 6 (4), pp. 315-338; Susilah, (2009) Reservoir Operation Model System in Indonesia, , Unimal Press, Lhokseumawe - Aceh; Bambang, T., (2009) Applied Hydrology, , Beta Offset, Yogyakarta; Tu, M.Y., Hsu, N.S., Yeh, W.G.W., Optimization of reservoir management and operation with hedging rules (2003) Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management; Wesli, (2008) Urban Drainage, , Graha Ilmu, Yogyakarta","Wesli; Malikussaleh UniversityIndonesia; email: ir_wesli@yahoo.co.id",,,"Gadjah Mada University",,,,,00249521,,,,"English","Indones.

A cross sectional household survey design was used in this study, using systematic sampling to obtain 150 household samples. Qualitative analysis and chi-square tests were used to analyze these data. Results indicated that only 54% of the sampled households have adopted soil conservation, and revealed that eight of the nine factors significantly influenced farmers' adoption, which are slope, farm size, farm distance from home, education level, family income, training, membership to NGOs, and credit accessibility. Only family size was insignificant. Other constraints are labour demands, cost of conservation work, land fragmentation, crop pests, and the limited agricultural extension services. It is recommended to perform training for farmers on designing soil conservation structures.

The study reveals that the surveyed villages have experienced a great spatial and socio-economic transformation. Continuous provision of infrastructural support from the government has led to a better integration of rural areas to the main regional center of Yogyakarta Municipality. The most evident spatial changes are found in terms of land use in the main corridors from Yogyakarta Municipality to various directions. Employment structure is characterized by the importance of non-farm activities related to the urban sector. Service and trading activities are the most important source of employment for those who conduct commuting, either as employees or independent workers in both urban formal and informal sectors. Another type of non-farm employment is food processing and services are to be found in situ in the growing rural urban zone. This type of employment is simply a form of adjustment to local circumstances in which higher population density provides more accessible threshold for various goods and services offered. Sectoral and spatial linkages of the existing non-farm employment is rather limited in terms of economic multiplier effects. Further employment and income generation linkages are almost negligible. Finally, two sets of policy options consisting of agricultural development and infrastructural provision are proposed in order to anticipate the growing importance of rural urban linkage in the future for the benefit of the rural areas.",,"agricultural development; infrastructural provision; labour absorption; land use change; off-farm employment; rural-urban linkage; Indonesia, Java, Yogyakarta",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00249521,,,,"English",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031429635

The eruption occurred in the southern parts of the volcano and the nuee ardente was witnessed between Turgo and Kaliurang hills via the Boyong river. Various volcanic materials were emitted on to the surface, including lava flows, gases, volcanic ash, sand and big blocks. The heavy rainfall which accompanied the eruption led to the formation of rain lahars, which also posed a threat in the lower portions of the volcano. Hugh volumes of volcanic materials found their way into the Boyong river and neighbouring rivers in the west, resulting in lahar floods. Some prognoses have been put forward as predictions or the outcomes of Merapi eruption both in the short-term and the long-term.

This research was conducted by employing oral interviews with husbands and wives (separately) on 59 randomly chosen households on the basis of interview schedules. The results of the research have shown that women are not only capable of successfully carrying out the bulk of the heavy agricultural tasks but also are better farm managers than men.

These problems arise due to the imbalance between natural resources and the population. Geography is a study of land and people, or a study of reciprocal relationships between man, earth and environment including the changes and developments. The geographer, therefore, has an academic and moral obligation to be active in applying practical analyses to the development problems. Since the 1960s geography has been confronted with various development theories. In developing countries, like Indonesia, geographical studies have now reached a higher and broader horizon because geography is no more just a pure science but also functions as an applied science with qualitative as well as quantitative analyses.
