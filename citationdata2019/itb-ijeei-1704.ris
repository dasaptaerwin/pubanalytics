AB  - A large proportion of the world's population lives in remote rural areas that are geographically isolated and sparsely populated. This paper proposed a hybrid power generation system suitable for remote area application. The concept of hybridizing renewable energy sources is that the base load is to be covered by largest and firmly available renewable source(s) and other intermittent source(s) should augment the base load to cover the peak load of an isolated mini electric grid system. The study is based on modeling, simulation and optimization of renewable energy system in rural area in Sundargarh district of Orissa state, India. The model has designed to provide an optimal system conFigureuration based on hour-by-hour data for energy availability and demands. Various renewable/alternative energy sources, energy storage and their applicability in terms of cost and performance are discussed. The homer software is used to study and design the proposed hybrid alternative energy power system model. The Sensitivity analysis was carried out using Homer program. Based on simulation results, it has been found that renewable/alternative energy sources will replace the conventional energy sources and would be a feasible solution for distribution of electric power for stand alone applications at remote and distant locations.

AB  - In recent years, Electrocardiogram (ECG) plays an imperative role in heart disease diagnostics, Human Computer Interface (HCI), stress and emotional states assessment, etc. In general, ECG signals affected by noises such as baseline wandering, power line interference, electromagnetic interference, and high frequency noises during data acquisition. In order to retain the ECG signal morphology, several researches have adopted using different preprocessing methods. In this work, the stroop color word test based mental stress inducement have done and ECG signals are acquired from 10 female subjects in the age range of 20 years to 25 years. We have considered the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) based wavelet denoising have incorporated using different thresholding techniques to remove three major sources of noises from the acquired ECG signals namely, power line interference, baseline wandering, and high frequency noises. Three wavelet functions ("db4", "coif5" and "sym7") and four different thresholding methods are used to denoise the noise in ECG signals. The experimental result shows the significant reduction of above considered noises and it retains the ECG signal morphology effectively. Four different performance measures were considered to select the appropriate wavelet function and thresholding rule for efficient noise removal methods such as, Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR), noise power, Percentage Root Mean Square Difference (PRD) and finally periodogramof Power Spectral Density (PSD). The experimental result shows the "coif5" wavelet andrigrsurethresholding rule is optimal for unknown Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in the real time ECG signals.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel Artificial Intelligence technique known as Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for optimal tuning of PID controllers for load frequency control. The design algorithm is applied to a hydrothermal power system consisting of two control areas one hydro and the other is thermal with reheat stage. To make the system in realistic form, the system nonlinearities represented by Generation Rate Constraint (GRC), Dead Band, wide range of parameters are introduced. Three different cost functions have been suggested for tuning the PID controllers. The system has been tested for various load changes to reveal the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique.

AB  - This paper describes the simulation model and the harmonics analysis of multi level inverters fed RL load and induction motor load. The SEIG fed H- bridge multi level inverter (MLI) for variable speed wind energy conversion systems are considered for various stand alone applications. In this paper, the SEIG fed cascaded five levels inverter for induction motor load systems are clearly explained with the help of MATLAB / SIMULINK models. The generated voltage of the wind driven self - excited induction generator (SEIG) is mainly depending on the wind velocity fluctuations, appropriate capacitance values and load conditions. The five levels cascaded inverter has interface with the wind driven self - excited induction generator (SEIG). The variable magnitude, variable frequency voltage of the generator can be controlled by choosing the proper modulation index. The simulation and harmonic analysis of the proposed inverter will be discussed and the total harmonic distortion will be evaluated.

AB  - The Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) is fast, flexible and efficient solution to voltage sag problem. The DVR is a power electronic based device that provides three-phase controllable voltage source, whose voltage vector (magnitude and angle) adds to the source voltage during sag event, to restore the load voltage to pre-sag conditions. The DVR is designed for protecting the whole plant with loads in the range of some MVA. The DVR can restore the load voltage within few milliseconds. Several configurations and control methods are proposed for the DVR. In this paper, an overview of the DVR, its functions, configurations, components, compensating strategies and control methods are reviewed along with the device capabilities and limitations.

AB  - Bandpass filters play a significant role in wireless communication systems. Transmitted and received signals have to be filtered at a certain center frequency with a specific bandwidth. In designing of microstrip filters, the first step is to carry out an approximated calculation based on using of concentrated components like inductors and capacitors. After getting the specifications required, we realized the filter structure with the parallel-coupled technique. Experimental verification gives comparison, how close the theoretical results and measurements look like.

AB  - Voltage instability is considered as one of the main threats to secure operation of power systems around the world. Grid connected renewable energy-based generation are deploying in recent years for many economic and environmental reasons. This type of generation could have significant impact on power system voltage stability given the nature of the primary source for generation and the technology used for energy conversion. This paper presents the results of an investigation of static voltage stability in heavily stressed IEEE-14 bus test system with large-scale PV integration. The study focused on the impact of large-scale PV penetrations and dynamic VAr placements on voltage stability of the sub-transmission system. For this study, the test system loads are modeled as the summer peak load of a realistic system. The comparison of STATCOM and SVC performance with large-scale PV is also discussed.

AB  - Network reconfiguration is a combinatorial optimization problem because it accounts various operational constraints in distribution systems. Plant Growth Simulation Algorithm has emerged as a useful optimization tool for handling nonlinear programming problems. In this paper, Plant Growth Simulation Algorithm has been proposed with a view to enhance speed and robustness. This method has been applied successfully on some benchmark mathematical problems. The solution for loss reduction through network reconfiguration involves a guiding search over the relevant configurations. The branch load balancing index and system load balancing index are defined for formulation of objective function of load balancing problem. Most of the methods published in the literature require external parameters such as barrier factors, crossover rate etc. The main advantage of the method presented here does not require external parameters. The proposed method is tested to reconfigure 69-node radial distribution system for loss minimization and load balancing.

AB  - For transmitting a huge electrical energy, high voltage transmission systems are commonly operated. Due to high reliability and less space required, gas insulated substation (GIS) are widely used. In a defect experienced GIS, partial discharge (PD) usually takes place. Partial discharge (PD) monitoring technique using UHF method becomes more popular because of its higher signal to noise (S/N) ratio. Amongst novel sensors, loop sensor could be a candidate for PD detector to measure UHF signal emitted from PD source. This paper presents the experiment results on characteristics of loop sensors. The characteristics of three loop sensors with varying diameter were examined using a spectrum analyzer and a network analyzer to obtain frequency characteristic and optimum operating frequency (S11) parameter, respectively. Then, PD experiment was conducted on 66kV GIS model having floating electrode and free metallic particles as its PD source. The loop sensors were placed far external to GIS bushing to measure leaked PD signal from it. The influences of the sensor diameter and the sensor distance from GIS bushing on PD detection sensitivity were also examined. Based on IEC-60270 standard measurement, the highest sensitivity of 30 pC was obtained from this investigation. The result suggests that higher sensitivity could be achieved with proper shielding and suitable filter design against external noise.

AB  - The utilization of video surveillance systems is becoming common and is expected to more widespread as societies become more complex and the population continues to grow. The implementation of these video surveillance systems has provided valuable information and assistance in monitoring large areas. These systems typically use human operators to determine human behavior and to manually track people or objects of interest over an array of cameras. With the application of computers with video surveillance, real time surveillance of large public areas, people and their activities has been made possible for monitoring and security. The main contribution of this paper is to show the effect of color space on tracking methods in video surveillance. Results from evaluations on different tracking methods have indicated that YCbCr and HSV color spaces have better tracking ability compared to grayscale and RGB color spaces. In addition, the results from evaluations have also indicated that data from selected layers in some color spaces can be used for the purpose of tracking namely the Cb and Cr layers from the YCbCr color space and the H layer from the HSV color space.

AB  - The design of array antenna is vital study for today's Wireless communication system to achieve higher gain, highly directional beam and also to counteract the effect of fading while signal propagates through various corrupted environments. In this study, the design and analysis of a (2×2) microstrip patch antenna array is introduced. It is designed to function in the 5.25 GHz which corresponds to IEEE 802.11a (VSWR&lt;2, data rate 54Mbps/ B.W 20 dB and S-parameters, S ij &lt;-20dB where i≠ j) wireless LAN application. It achieves single band functionality through additional slots to rectangular patch of dimension 18.8 mm by 24.4mm. The proposed antenna array is a high gain, low-cost, low weight base station antenna. The characteristic analyses such as return loss (RL), bandwidth, VSWR and radiation pattern of the prototype antenna array have been investigated both numerically and experimentally. In this investigation, VSWR less than 1.45 and bandwidth of 180MHz (For RL&gt;-9.5dB) and antenna gain of 13.88 dBi have been achieved. Both numerical and experimental studies have been carried out to optimize the distance between the antenna elements. The measured results have a good agreement with that of simulated results. The numerical study has been done by using Zeland make IE3D electromagnetic simulator and measurements have been done with the help of Agilent make N5230A, network analyzer.

AB  - In high voltage (HV) electrical power system, variety of solid, liquid and gaseous materials are used for insulation purpose to protect the incipient failure inside the HV power equipment. Among these the solid insulation is widely used for high voltage power equipment HV electrical power system. Most of insulating materials are not perfect in all respect and contains always some impurities. The presence of air bubble is one of such impurities in insulating materials and highly undesirable for such type of insulation which causes a local weak zone inside the insulator. Insulation of the HV power equipment gradually degrades inside the insulator due to cumulative effect of electrical, chemical and thermal stress. Due to the high voltage stress the weak zone inside the insulator causes the partial discharge (PD) which is known as local electrical breakdown. As a result the insulation properties of such materials are enormously degrades its quality due to the PD. In this work, the simulation of PD activity due to presence of a small cylindrical void inside the solid insulation material of high voltage power equipment is studied with the MATLAB Simulink platform.

AB  - Most existing image enhancement algorithms work on a single image. Their performance is limited to the capacity of the sensor by which the image is taken. In some cases they completely fail to provide us the necessary enhancements. This paper proposes a composite image approach for enhancing still images. The approach proposed combines the relevant features of the input images and produce a composite image which is rich in information content for human eye. The input images are first decomposed into multiple resolutions by using the contourlet transform which provides a better representation than the conventional transforms. Transformed coefficients are combined with a predefined fusion rules. The resultant image is found by performing inverse contourlet transformation of the composite image. The results found are encouraging and the algorithm does not introduce any distortion for applications in low light and/or non uniform lighting conditions. The composite image also contains almost all of the salient features of the input images.

AB  - The study is objected to investigate the response of a magnetorheological brake (MRB) system under thefree move inertial mass. The disk-type MRB comprises of a rotating disk immersed in magnetorheological fluids (MRFs) and surrounded by an electromagnet coil. The magnetized coil causes a solidification of the MR fluid so that the shear stress between the moving part and static part increases resulting in the decrement speed of the moving parts. The shear stress can be varied by applying different electric current to the coil. The study began with the part design using the3D modeling software, followingbythe magnetostatic analysis. The flux density across the magnetorheological fluid could be predicted through this finite element magnetic simulation. The quantity of magnetic flux was then used to predict the shear stress between static and moving parts. The fabricated MRB was integrated onto a test rig which employs load cell and speed sensor as well as completely instrumented with data acquisition.Since the MRB test rig performed a simple free rotation system, a linear second order differential equation was derived to model the stopping time and braking torque behaviors. The equation of motion was built in a Simulink model, and the simulation results were compared to the real measurement. The achievable braking torque was also presented based on theaverage value from the load cell. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper discusses the development of loop antenna to detect partial discharge (PD). The loop antenna is designed to measure PD induced EM wave in the frequency up to 100 MHz. The form, the circumference, the number of rounds of loop antenna affect the frequency response of the antenna. In the design, the circumference of a loop antenna is set to be a tenth of a wavelength of PD induced EM wave. The conductor wire length of loop antenna is set to be 30 cm to achieve 100 MHz bandwidth. Various forms of the loop antenna: circle, square, and triangle have been designed and implemented. The designed loop antennas were applied to measure PD in high voltage laboratory. The needle-plate electrodes in air is used as a PD source. The test results showed that the new designed loop antennas were able to detect and measure PD. PD induced EM wave waveform and pattern were measured. The effect of distance between PD source and the antennas was observed. The sensitivity of the circle loop antenna is the best among the new designed loop antennas. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics .All right reserved.

AB  - In the constrained dynamic ED problem, considering some practical operation constraints of generators, such as ramp rate limits and prohibited operating zones, electric power generation of units are scheduled. So, this paper, considering these constraints, presents a new optimization technique based on Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) to solve the Economic Dispatch (ED) problem in power systems. To show the efficiency of the proposed method, this algorithm is applied to solve constrained dynamic ED problem of two power systems with 6 and 15 units. The results are compared to those achieved from conventional methods such as Simulated Annealing (SA), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The experimental results show that the proposed method is capable to determine the solutions of ED problem more fast and accurate than other conventional approaches.

AB  - This paper presents a three-phase three-wire shunt active filter based on intelligent controllers to compensate current harmonics. Shunt active filter is the best solution to eliminate harmonics drawn from nonlinear load especially for low power system, the most inverter used is the two-level voltage source. The control strategies adopted to determine the compensation currents are the synchronous reference frame (SRF) detection method and the synchronous current reference (SCR) detection method. To improve the performance of the conventional control scheme based on hysteresis controller and take advantages of intelligent techniques, fuzzy and ANN current controllers are proposed in this paper. To maintain the dc voltage capacitor constant and compensate the inverter losses a proportional integral voltage controller is used. The numerical simulation is developed and performed using MATLAB-Simulink and SimPowerSystemd Toolbox from complete structure including control and power circuits. The obtained results show the simplicity and the effectiveness of the two proposed intelligent current controllers.

AB  - Face recognition is gaining enormous interest nowadays. However, the technical challenges to "teach" a computer to recognize faces have been very difficult. Many methods and approaches have been proposed in the literature. This paper presents a face recognition method based on the combined kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and support vector machine (SVM) methods. First, the KPCA method is utilized to extract features from the input images. The SVM method is then applied to these extracted features to classify the input images. We compare the performance of this face recognition method to other commonly-used methods. Our experiments show that the combination of KPCA and SVM achieves a higher performance compared to the nearest neighbor classifier, support vector machine, and the combination of kernel principal component analysis and nearest neighbor classifier.

AB  - This paper proposes a hybrid carrier based space vector modulation suitable for multiphase multilevel inverters. Multiphase multilevel inverters are controlled by this hybrid modulation to provide multiphase variable voltage and variable frequency supply. The proposed modulation inherits the features of fundamental frequency modulation and carrier based space vector modulation strategies. The main characteristics of this hybrid modulation are the reduction in power losses, and effectively improve harmonic performance. This algorithm can be applied to cascaded multilevel inverter topologies; it has low computational complexity and it is suitable for hardware implementations. Theoretical considerations are detailed using a five phase multilevel inverter. The performance of this hybrid modulation is analyzed based on power loss, weighted total harmonic distortion, the linearity and it is compared with standard modulation strategies. Simulation and experiment results confirm the good performance of the proposed modulation scheme.

AB  - High voltage transformer is one of the most important equipments in an electric power system. High voltage insulation plays important role in determining transformer performance and greatly determines the lifetime. In general, paper and oil composite is used as main insulations in a high voltage transformer. Due to thermal aging, the insulation performances of the insulation may be degraded. The degradation mechanisms are important to be clarified. This paper reports the experimental results on the effects of thermal aging on the properties of paper-oil composite insulation. The samples used were thermally upgraded kraft paper and mineral oil. They are widely used in high voltage transformers. Samples were conditioned to the same initial conditions through the heating at a temperature of 100 °C for 24 hours. Mineral oil samples with volume of 800 ml and 6 gram insulating kraft paper were put in hermetical bottles. The paper-oil ratio reflects the typical ratio of oil and kraft paper inside a real transformer. The bottles containing oil and paper samples were subjected to thermal aging at 120°C and 150°C in a controllable oven for a period up to 4 weeks. Dielectric properties of the oil such as breakdown voltage, resistivity, water content were measured after and before aging. Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) was used to identify the gasses released in the paper-oil composite insulation as the results of thermal aging process. The morphological aging of the kraft paper was investigated using SEM (scanning electron microscopy) while chemical element change was investigated using EDS (energy dispersive spectroscopy) with accelerated voltage of 0.3-30 kV. The results showed that the dielectric properties will decrease with the increasing duration and temperature of aging. From these experiments obtained CO gases, produced from thermal degradation of paper cellulose chain. H2 and C2H2 gases are not generated in this experiment. The result was consistent since H2 usually generated under partial discharges while C2H2 released under very high temperature such as partial combustion, electric arc which were not available in the experiment. Some hydrocarbon gas such as CH4, C2H4 and C2H6 were detected. CO gas was obtained as the result thermal aging of paper insulation through oxidation process. The EDS analysis showed that during aging the C element increased while O element decreased. EDS data of krafft paper aged at 120°C for a duration of 4 weeks (672 hours) taken using JEOL 6510 at accelerated voltage of 10 kV with energy range of 0-20 kV showed that the aged paper consists of 3 elements, C, O and K elements with mass percentage of 75.23 % of C at energy of 0.277 kV, O of 21.69 % observed at energy of 0.525 kV and new element of K with mass percentage of 3.08 observed at energy of 3.312 kV. It is clearly observed that C increased from 58.83 % to 75.23 %. This is due to the migration from the ester into the paper on the other hand oxygen reduced from 41.17 % to 21.69 % because the oxygen from the paper reacted with oil in an oxidation and release CO gas as confirmed by DGA (dissolved gas analysis). Similar behavior was observed for aging at 150°C. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to develop the assessment of speech disorders for detecting patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), we have collected 34 sustained vowel / a /, from 34 subjects including 17 PD patients. We subsequently extracted from 1 to 20 coefficients of the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) from each individual. To extract the voiceprint from each individual, we compressed the frames by calculating their average value. For classification, we used the Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) validation scheme and the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with its different types of kernels, (i.e.; RBF, Linear and polynomial). The best classification accuracy achieved was 91.18% using the first 12 coefficients of the MFCCs by Linear kernels SVMs. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper presents performances of a harvest season artificial bee colony (HSABC) algorithm for obtaining the best solution of a combined economic and emission dispatch (CEED). Two strategies of placement are applied to IEEE-30 bus system for solving the CEED problem under some constraints. Modified rates and various distances are also used to demonstrate HSABC's performances. Simulation results show that two placement strategies have different implications for the CEED, application of various modified rates and distances affect to convergence speeds, minimum results are searched in different starting points at the first iteration and the total number of food sources gives effects to the HSABC's performances.

AB  - Distribution system reconfiguration problem is a complex optimization process to find a structure with minimum losses in which the satisfaction of both sides, that is consumers and distribution system companies, need to be met. One of the most significant parameters in this regard is to increase the reliability of system. This parameter, on one hand, increases the satisfaction of power consumption and on the other hand, improves the economic benefits of distribution companies. Distribution system reconfiguration, considering the reliability parameters, seems to make the attempts to solve the problem of optimization difficult. In this paper, a new heuristic approach for distribution system reconfiguration in order to decrease the power losses cost and damage cost due to power supply interruption of consumers has been presented. Radial network construction and all energized nodes constraints are the most important ones that should be considered in distribution system reconfiguration problem. Hence, in this paper a new codification is proposed which is computationally efficient and guarantees to generate only feasible radial topologies all times. In order to illustrate the performance of proposed heuristic method, modified 33-bus and 119-bus distribution networks have been employed which have led to the desired results.

AB  - This paper reports on validation of a numerical model for both transient and steady bipolar charge transport, trapping and recombination in polymeric insulators, such as low density polyethylene. The numerical model is based on the high precision Runge-Kutta method for determining mobile and trapped charge local density within the sample, during the application of a DC voltage. In addition, we have applied the finite element method considered as the most general one, which can be applied to any sample shape and boundary conditions. It is applied to resolve Poisson's equation, thus providing the potential and its gradient within the sample and at the dielectric-electrode interfaces. The principal results show the appearance of charge packets for the first time in modeling works although they have long been reported in experimental studies on polyethylene materials. The conditions for the appearance of such packets are discussed. For the net space charge density and the conduction current, the dynamics are in a good agreement with those observed in some experimental works during the transit time of the bipolar carriers. The model is already numerically validated for the space charge densities and the electric field distribution under low DC voltage.

AB  - Voltage collapse is an undesired phenomenon that occurs due to voltage instability and is generally associated with weak or stressed system (heavily loaded lines), long lines, radial networks, faults and/or reactive power shortages. Its occurrence is not frequent in developed countries despite their large and complex networks but its frequency is high in Egypt. Voltage collapses are highly catastrophic anytime they occur. On the Egyptian Interconnected Electrical Grid EIEG, the system collapse phenomenon is frequently experienced and often leads to either partial or total system collapse blackout, which greatly impairs the nation’s socio-economic development and industrialization. This high rate is due to the fact that the EIEG is weak, highly stressed, long and radial in nature hence lacking flexibility. The analysis is performed for EIEG power system. Modern advances in technology are changing the way utility industry increase the transmission of power throughout the country. Distributed energy resources are constantly improving their reliability and power capabilities. The model analysis technique is performed for system using the constant load model. The simulation results are Q-V curves on weak voltages by Power World Simulator PWS Software and Matlab Program. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics .All right reserved.

AB  - This paper presents three-level (NPC) shunt active power filter the performances based on fuzzy control techniques to compensate harmonic currents generated by non-linear loads operating under non ideal voltage conditions. Shunt APF is the best solution to eliminate harmonics drawn from nonlinear load especially for low power system, the most inverter used is the two-level voltage source inverter. Multilevel inverters are being investigated and recently used for APF topologies. Today Threelevel inverter is one of the most used converters in the majority of industrial applications, such as machine drives and power active filters. The control strategy used is based on the synchronous reference frame detection method that gives a good performance particularly if the source voltage is unbalanced or distorted. The new control scheme proposed in this work is based on fuzzy techniques and it is designed to improve APF compensation capability by adjusting the current error based on fuzzy rule. To improve the output three-level voltage inverter and avoid an unbalanced AC voltage waveform a neutral-point potential voltage compensator based on proportional controller is used with a proportional integral controller required to maintain dc voltage constant. The results of simulation study obtained using Matlab-Simulink and SimPowerSystem Toolbox are found quite satisfactory to eliminate harmonics and reactive power components from utility current.

AB  - As the population of transformers in service increases and their operating time extends, much attention has been focused on their availability and reliability. However, insufficient research work concentrates on how to evaluate transformer's aging condition, although huge progress has been made on the techniques of fault diagnosis and condition assessment of transformer in past decades. This paper presents the concept of Aging Index (AI), which is a practical tool that combines the results of routine inspections, and site and laboratory testing to estimate the aging condition of oil-immersed transformers. Further, frequency domain spectroscopy (FDS) as a novel non-destructive testing technique to estimate remained life expectancy is included in aging evaluation system. Moreover, a software system based on transformer's electrical and thermal parameters is developed correspondingly, by using a multi-parameters analytic approach. This system would dedicate to decision-making and replacement planning and has good application prospects.

AB  - This paper presents the design and analysis of a novel fork-connected autotransformer based 30-phase ac-dc converter which supplies direct torque controlled induction motor drives (DTCIMD's) in order to have better power quality conditions at the point of common coupling. The proposed converter output voltage is accomplished via five paralleled 6-pulse ac-dc converters each of them consisting of 3-phase diode bridge rectifier. An autotransformer is designed to supply the rectifiers. The proposed converter requires five inter-phase transformers in the dc link. The design procedure of magnetics is in a way such that makes it suitable for retrofit applications where a sixpulse diode bridge rectifier is being utilized. The aforementioned structure improves power quality criteria at ac mains and makes them consistent with the IEEE-519 standard requirements for varying loads. Furthermore, near unity power factor is obtained for a wide range of DTCIMD operation. A comparison is made between 6- pulse and proposed converters from view point of power quality indices. Results show that input current total harmonic distortion (THD) is less than 2% for the proposed topology at variable loads.

AB  - This paper presents a comparison between a fuzzy logic controller and a conventional IP controller used for speed control with a direct stator flux orientation control of a doubly fed induction motor. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is evaluated under different operating conditions such as of reference speed and for load torque step changes at nominal parameters and in the presence of parameter variation. Simulation results show that the fuzzy logic controller is more robust than a conventional IP controller against parameter variation and uncertainty, and is less sensitive to external load torque disturbance with a fast dynamic response.

AB  - Insulator is one of the most important equipments in an electric power system. Since long time ago ceramic insulators are widely used in transmission as well as in distribution lines. As outdoor insulators, the insulators are subjected to outdoor environmental stresses such as humidity, temperature and pollution. Under polluted and wet condition, high leakage current may flow on the insulator surface. As the result a dry band arching may take place and in the long time it may degrade the insulator and initiate the insulator flash over leading to the failure of the lines. Several efforts may be taken to improve the insulator performance under polluted condition. They are increasing the number of insulator strings, modification of insulator design to increase the creep age distance and regular washing. This paper presents the investigation \ results on the silicone coating on ceramic insulators under laboratory and real environmental conditions. It was found that the coating was significantly suppressed the magnitude of leakage current and drastically eliminated the harmonic content. The coating also drastically suppressed the corona on the insulator and reduced the surface temperature. The coating also significantly increased the flash over voltage of the insulator. Leakage current analysis and simulation showed significant improvement of surface resistance of insulator after application of RTV coating under most environmental conditions compared to those of uncoated insulators. Overall investigation results indicated significant improvement of insulator performances by applying RTV silicone rubber coating.

AB  - Substations as a whole being an important part of the complete power system, grounding system of substations plays a vital role in overall performance of reliable power system. Grounding system of any substation deserves considerable care and attention at design stage, primarily to ensure electrical safety of persons working within or near substations. Looking to such great significance of grounding system design procedure, software which analyzes performance of ground grids of various shapes as per method described in IEEE standard 80 - 2000 has been developed using MATLAB®. Proposed software is able to calculate various performance parameters of grounding system for given input data related to grid geometry, soil and system conditions for all the basic shapes of grounding grid in uniform and two layered soils. Additionally this software can also suggest optimal i.e. most appropriate, safe and cost effective design of the grounding system under given conditions and safety constraints. This software is deployed as windows standalone application using MATLAB run time compiler. Hence it can run on systems where MATLAB is not installed. In order to test the performance of the software, simple design problems have been solved and the results given by it are compared with those obtained form ETAP - GGS module and after verifying its technical performance it is found to be quite reliable tool in the field of grounding system design.

AB  - In this article, a new intelligent search evolution algorithm (ISEA) is proposed to minimize the generator fuel cost in optimal power flow (OPF) control with multi-line flexible alternating current transmission systems (FACTS) device which is interline power flow controller (IPFC). Unlike the OPF solution methods existing in the literature, in the proposed algorithm, a two step initialization process have been adopted which eliminates the mutation operation and also it gives optimal solution with less number of generations. The proposed algorithm has been examined and tested on a standard IEEE-30 bus system without and with IPFC. The test results indicate that the proposed algorithm with IPFC can obtain better solution than without IPFC.

AB  - This paper deals with electric field characteristics under three-phase voltage in threephase gas insulated switchgear (GIS). Three-phase equipment differs from single-phase equipment in two aspects: configuration and applied voltage. In this paper the effects of these differences on electric field in three-phase GIS are reported. There are periodic changes in the electric field magnitude and direction produced by three-phase voltage at any point. While the voltage phase varies, the electric field vector changes and rotates continuously. The rotating characteristics of the electric field vector in three-phase power apparatus depended on the position inside the insulation of the tank. The electric field vector locus is circular, elliptic, or linear. The elliptical nature of rotating electric field is expressed as electric field ratio. The mathematic description of the rotating electric field is given considering the maximum and the minimum electric field and the position inside the insulation. There is no zero electric field under threephase voltage. The areal velocity of the electric field vector locus is constant. The electric field vector moves slowly in a high electric field area, but moves quickly in a low electric field area.

AB  - This paper deals with partial discharge measurement and partial discharge characteristics on a three-phase construction. A simplified model of three-phase gas insulated switchgear is used in the experiment to simulate three-phase electric field in three-phase equipment. A particle was adhered on the different positions on the conductor and on the tank to produce partial discharge. Partial discharge signals flowing on three phase conductors were measured simultaneously with three high frequency current transformers clamped on the threephase lines through capacitive voltage divider. Partial discharge signals induced on the enclosure were measured with the current transformer and the detecting impedance. The circuit was calibrated and examined by injecting known charges from a pulse calibrator to some points in the circuit. The calibration results indicate that measuring partial discharge signals only at the enclosure or on one of the phases of three phase construction will result in the position dependent sensitivity for partial discharges. Experimental results show that partial discharge inception voltages of a particle adhered on different position differed depended on the particle position. Phase of partial discharge inception voltage also depended on the particle position. Experimental results show that partial discharge caused by a particle on one phase conductor was induced and detected on the other phase conductors. Polarity and magnitude of discharge current flowing on each phase depended on the particle position. Each particle at different position generated discharge current which flowed on each phase so that the magnitude ratios of the currents flowing on each phase were unique for each particle. These results were discussed with considering electric field characteristic in three-phase construction and coupling capacitance between three-phase conductors and between the conductors and the tank.

AB  - The objective of optimal feeder reconfiguration of radial distribution system problem is to obtain the best set of branches to be opened, one each from each loop, such that the resulting radial distribution system has the desired performance. This paper presents a feeder reconfiguration problem in the presence of distributed generators to minimize the system power loss while satisfying operating constraints using Hyper Cube-Ant Colony Optimization (HC-ACO) algorithm. Loss Sensitivity analysis is used to identify optimal location for installation of DG units. Simulations are conducted on 33 - bus radial distribution system at four different cases to verify the efficacy of the proposed method with other recent published approaches reported in the literature. The result shows that the method proposed is fast and effective.

AB  - The proposal of this paper is on a simple and fast distribution load flow solution algorithm. The proposed method fully exploits the radial structure of the network and solves the distribution load flow directly using the single dimension vectors. An effective data structure is proposed to identify lines and number of lines available beyond the particular line. Using this concept, power summations are calculated to obtain the distribution load flow solution. Unlike other traditional methods, the proposed method consider the effective convergence approach which is not only simple and fast but also is efficient from time perspective and needs very less memory for any size of the distribution system compared with the existing methods. The proposed concept was tested on standard distribution system and results are promising and have great potential for applications in the distribution automation.

AB  - Power-system stability improvement by shunt FACTS based damping controllers are thoroughly investigated in this paper. The present study considered both local and remote signals with associated time delays. The design problem of the proposed controller is formulated as an optimization problem, and differential evolution (DE) algorithm is employed to search for the optimal controller parameters. The performances of the proposed controllers are evaluated under different disturbances for both single-machine infinite bus power system and multi-machine power system. The performance of the proposed controllers with variations in the signal transmission delays has also been investigated. Simulation results are presented under various operating conditions and disturbances to show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

AB  - This paper presents real time simulation to analyze the behavior of discrete controller for interconnected power system. A two-area interconnected power system consisting of non-identical power plants with EHVAC transmission link as interconnection is considered for investigations. The hydro and nuclear power plant comprises of area-1 and area-2 respectively. In this paper new control strategies for digital controller is developed depending on the sampling time to test the controller in the non real time simulation environment and transform the controller into a real-time prototype controller, which is used for testing the algorithm in real working conditions. The real time simulation provides a quick solution for prototyping new functions in different types of industrial processes and devices controlled with a complex distributed control system. The real time simulation uses the discrete model of the AGC. Hence discrete controller for the AGC is derived from the continuous controller by discritization of the continuous controller using Tustin transformation, or trapezoid approximation method and the closed loop stability is checked by taking the bode of the closed loop of AGC model for different sampling time periods,the dynamic response plot for 1% load disturbance in area-1. The discrete controller is prototyped and the real time simulation is performed to observe the results, the dynamic response plots are obtained for 1% load disturbance in area-1 of the real time model.

AB  - In this paper a complete state-space average model for the buck switching regulators is presented. The presented model includes the most of the regulator's parameters and uncertainties. In modeling, the load current is assumed to be unknown, and it is assumed that the inductor, capacitor, diode and regulator active switch are non ideal and they have a resistance in conduction condition. Some other non ideal effects look like voltage drop of conduction mode of the diode and active switch are also considered. This model can be used to design a precise and robust controller that can satisfy stability and performance conditions of the buck regulator. Also the effects of the boost parameters on the performance of the regulator can be shown easily with this model. After presenting the complete model, the buck converter Benchmark circuit is simulated in PSpice and its results are compared with our model simulation results in MATLAB. The results show the merit of our model.

AB  - This paper presents an algorithm for solving the multi-objective reactive power dispatch problem in a power system. Modal analysis of the system is used for static voltage stability assessment. Loss minimization and maximization of voltage stability margin are taken as the objectives. Generator terminal voltages, reactive power generation of the capacitor banks and tap changing transformer setting are taken as the optimization variables. In this paper an intelligent water drop (IWD) algorithm has been proposed to solve this combinatorial optimization problem. Intelligent water drop algorithm is a swarm-based nature inspired optimization algorithm, which has been inspired from natural rivers. A natural river often finds good paths among lots of possible paths in its ways from source to destination and finally find almost optimal path to their destination. These ideas are embedded into proposed algorithm for solving reactive dispatch problem.

AB  - The modern microwave and millimeter wave communication system demands good filtering characteristics with compact sizes. In this paper the attention has been given towards the design of a good elliptical lowpass filter with sharp transition between passband and stopband, negligible passband insertion loss and wide stop band. A new defected ground structure (DGS) consisting of two square slots connects with a rectangular slot by two thin transverse slots underneath a microstrip line is proposed. In the frequency characteristics of proposed unit pattern provides an attenuation zero close to an attenuation pole. As a result, better transition sharpness, lower passband insertion loss and broader stopband are observed compares to dumbbell DGS. An equivalent lumped L-C network is proposed to model the introduced DGS unit and corresponding L-C parameters are extracted. A 3rd order quasi-elliptic lowpass filter with 1.4 GHz cutoff frequency, 1.7 GHz attenuation pole frequency, negligible passband insertion loss, almost 100 dB/GHz sharpness factor and 1.56GHz passband bandwidth (at -15 dB) is designed by cascading three investigated DGS units of different dimensions under capacitively loaded microstrip line.

AB  - The switched reluctance motor drives has evolved as an alternative to conventional motors in variable speed drives because of advantages like simple and rugged structure, absence of rotor winding, adaptability to harsh environments like coal mining, high speed operation etc. Because of nonlinearity, torque ripple is high in the motor. This paper presents a high dynamic control technique called Direct Instantaneous Torque Control (DITC) where in the torque is maintained within a hysteresis band by changing the switching states of the phases. Thus torque ripple minimization and fast torque response is an inherent property of DITC. This paper analyses performance of the drive mainly in terms of the torque ripple during acceleration and steady state conditions with DITC in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment and results are discussed elaborately.

AB  - This paper presents transient stability assessment of a large actual 87-bus system and the IEEE 39-bus system using the probabilistic neural network (PNN) with enhanced feature selection and extraction methods. The investigated power systems are divided into smaller areas depending on the coherency of the areas when subjected to disturbances. This is to reduce the amount of data sets collected for the respective areas. Transient stability of the power system is first determined based on the generator relative rotor angles obtained from time domain simulations carried out by considering three phase faults at different loading conditions. The data collected from the time domain simulations are then used as inputs to the PNN. An enhanced feature selection and extraction methods are then incorporated to reduce the input features to the PNN which is used as a classifier to determine whether the power system is stable or unstable. It can be concluded that the PNN with enhanced feature selection and extraction methods reduces the time taken to train the PNN without affecting the accuracy of the classification results.

AB  - This paper proposes a cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) using different distributions for solving the short-term hydrothermal scheduling (ST-HTS) problem with reservoir storage constraint on hydropower plants. The CSA method is a new meta-heuristic algorithm inspired from the obligate brood parasitism of some cuckoo species by laying their eggs in the nests of other host birds of other species for solving optimization problems. The advantages of the CSA method are few control parameters and effective for optimization problems with complicated constraints. In the proposed CSA, three distributions have been used including Lévy distribution, Gaussian distribution and Cauchy distribution. The proposed method has been tested on two test systems and the obtained results have been compared to that from other methods available in the literature. The result comparisons have indicated that the proposed method is a very favorable method for solving the short term hydrothermal scheduling problems with reservoir constraint. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - High voltage transmission has been chosen in electric power system due to its capability to transfer a large amount of electric power. Several key equipments such as generator, transformer, GIS, cable and insulator play important role in determining the reliability of the power system. The high voltage equipments in general contain gas, liquid or solid insulation. Defects and a particular condition may lead to extremely high electric field. Particularly at interfaces between gas and solid and liquid insulations, the excessive electric field may cause the breakdown of the gas while the liquid and solid insulations are still able to withstand the electric field. This phenomena is referred as partial discharge (PD). Partial discharges in high voltage equipments for long time may degrade the quality of the insulation and at the same time the appearance of discharges can be used as diagnostic signal for assessing the condition of the insulation inside the high voltage equipments. Partial discharge is an important subject investigated by many researchers and discussion in many international conferences as well as international journals or transactions. This paper discusses the measurement and experimental results and analysis on time-resolved partial discharges in gas, liquid and solid insulation. The partial discharges are presented in various distribution such as ɸ-q-n, ɸ-n and three dimensional distribution. Here ɸ is phase angle, q is the discharge magnitude and n is the discharge number. Based on the partial discharge data, diagnosis methods of high voltage equipments as also presented. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper studies the suitability of shorted patch and CPW-feed square slot antennas for CubeSat communications. To study the effect of the CubeSat body on the antennas performance, we have simulated both antennas in the High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) with and without the CubeSat body. Compared to CPW-feed square slot antenna, the shorted patch antenna achieves higher gain and wider bandwidth. We have also re-dimensioned both antennas to shift their resonant frequencies to 2.45 GHz using Quasi Newton method in HFSS. This thus enables their use in the unlicensed ISM band. The repurposed shorted patch has smaller return loss; e.g.,-27.5 dB (without CubeSat), higher gain; e.g., 5.3 dBi and wider bandwidth than the repurposed CPW-feed Square slot antenna. Lastly, further enhancement in the gain of re-dimensioned CPW-feed square slot antenna shows an increase of total gain from 2 to 2.52 dB. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper deals with the development of printed log-periodic dipole array (LPDA) antenna in reduced size by applying fractal Koch geometry structure. The proposed printed LPDA fractal Koch antennas which are deployed on FR4 Epoxy dielectric substrates with the thickness of 1.6mm and relative permittivity of 4.3 are designed to have working bandwidth from 1.5GHz to 3GHz to cover some frequency bands of wireless communication. Some basic properties of antenna are analyzed numerically related to the physical parameters and its iterations in order to have optimum performance design. Three different iterations of printed LPDA fractal Koch antenna called as 0th, 1st, and 2nd iterations are introduced for the performance analysis. It shows that the printed LPDA fractal Koch antenna with the 2nd iteration has size reduction up to 21.18% and 25.28% than the 0th iteration and 1st iteration, respectively. Whilst from the performance result, although some properties of operating frequency and gain still need more improvement it shows that the 2nd iteration antenna has a better performance compared to others in term of working bandwidth. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In this paper, the characterization of wireless power charging receiver for mobile device developed based on magnetic resonance coupling is presented. The receiver is constructed of an electromagnetic waves radiator which is implemented by use of microstrip patch on a dielectric substrate to operate at frequency of around 10MHz and a rectifier circuit which comprises of a voltage doubler circuit. Prior the hardware realization, the designed of receiver is performed through simulation to investigate the influence of level and frequency of input voltage to the DC voltage of rectifier circuit output. The radiator efficiency and performance of rectifier circuit are two things that are focused in the investigation. From the experimental characterization, it shows that the radiator efficiency for a considerable gap is more than 37% for some level of varied input AC signal. While the DC voltage of rectifier circuit output has the voltage deviation less than 2% for operating frequency of input voltage varied up to 20%. In addition, it is demonstrated that the receiver is able to start charging a battery of mobile phone by producing 4.12VDC at the output of receiver with the gap separation between 2 radiators of 0.8mm. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics .All right reserved.

AB  - This paper deals with the electric field characteristics in the inter-phases region of three-phase gas insulated switchgear (GIS).The electric field in a three-phase construction of a simplified GIS model was analyzed.The results show that in the inter-phases region the direction and the magnitude of electric field vector varies with the location of the observation point while in the phase-enclosure region the direction of the electric field vector tends to linear and constant. There is no zero electric field on the particle tip of a particle in the inter-phases region, except S90 particle. There is zero electric field on the particle tip of a particle in the phase-enclosure region every half cycle of applied voltage. The maximum electric field of the particles on the inter-phases region generally is higher than one of the particles on the phase-enclosure region. The electric field vector locus in the inter-phases region varies: linear, elliptic, or circular while one in phase-enclosure region is constant and linear.

AB  - We propose in this work a method of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal pretreatment by the application of Discreet Wavelet Transform DWT by automatically determining the optimal order of decomposition. After the purification of the original signal, we describe an algorithm to detect R waves based on the Dyadic Wavelet Transform DyWT by applying a windowing process. This algorithm is validated on a sample of synthesis ECG signal with and without noise which we have proposed and on real data. Finally, once the R peaks of real data are detected, we use three methods of RR intervals analysis by calculating the standard deviation of heart rate and applying the Fast Fourier Transform FFT and the Wavelet Transform on detected RR intervals to study the Heart Rate Variability (HRV). A comparative study between the analysis results of detected RR intervals in healthy and diseased subjects through the application of the FFT and the Wavelet Transform will be given.

AB  - Big-Bang and Big-crunch (BB-BC), a heuristic optimization method is based on the concept of universal evolution. FireFly optimization (FFO), also a recent heuristic optimization method, is based on the concept of flashing behaviour of lightingbugs. Both the optimization methods are applied to obtain the solution of the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) with continuous and discrete control variables for quadratic generator output cost functions. The continuous control variables are generating unit active power outputs and generator bus voltage magnitudes, while the discrete ones are transformertap settings and switchable shunt devices. A number of functional constraints such as load bus voltage magnitudes, line flows and reactive power capabilities are included as quadratic penalties in the optimization function. A comparative simulation results for Ward -Hale 6 bus system with seven control variables and IEEE 30 bus system with twenty-three control variables are presented.

AB  - A new lower bound below the information rate transferred through the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel affected by discrete-time multiplicative phase noise is proposed in the paper. The proposed lower bound is based on the Kalman approach to data-aided carrier phase recovery, and is less computationally demanding than known methods based on phase quantization and trellis representation of phase memory or on particle filtering. Simulation results show that the lower bound is close to the actual channel capacity, especially at low-to-intermediate signal-to-noise ratio.

AB  - This paper presents a congestion management methodology in deregulated power systems by making use of optimal placement of thyristor controlled series compensators (TCSCs) in transmission network. The problem formulation consists of maximization of social welfare function subject to real and reactive power balance, constant power factor of consumers, transmission congestion (line loading), generators' capability curve constraints, and bounds on variables. The social welfare function, which customarily comprises of demand benefits minus generation costs, has been modified to include the effect of usage cost of TCSCs. The proposed congestion management methodology takes into account number of potential scenarios of market conditions. The location of TCSCs in power system is decided by making use of integer variables; hence formulation of proposed problem takes the form of Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is tested on a 5-bus and IEEE 14-bus systems and results obtained are compared with those obtained by existing approaches. It can be concluded that congestion management results obtained with proposed methodology are better than those obtained by existing approaches.

AB  - Weibull distribution has been used widely by many researches around the world especially in the analysis of high voltage experimental data. Unfortunately, the statistical techniques used to analyse the high voltage experimental data are not highly accurate. In view of the foregoing, this paper presents a new statistical approach to analyze the tree inception voltage of silicone rubber and epoxy resin. The tree inception voltage of silicone rubber and epoxy resin was measured via camera-equipped online monitoring system. The leaf-like specimen was used as test sample. AC ramp voltage was applied to obtain the tree inception voltage of silicone rubber and epoxy resin. It was observed that, the electroluminescence emission and ultraviolet (UV) radiation occurred indicating the early stage of tree occurrence. The obtained results were analysed statistically by using fitting method. Anderson-Darling goodness-of-fit test was performed in order to obtain the best fitting distribution. Comparison was made between the best-fitted distribution and Weibull distribution. Based on Anderson-Darling tests, the tree inception voltage of silicone rubber and epoxy resin was best fitted with Johnson SB distribution. Based on this fitted distribution, the value of tree inception voltage for silicone rubber and epoxy resin was calculated and equalled to 11.80 kV and 20.11 kV respectively. From this study, it was found out that the best-fitted distribution for the value of tree inception voltage for silicone rubber and epoxy resin is the Johnson SB distribution by means of Anderson-Darling goodness-of-fit test.

AB  - The present concept of u-Healthcare is based on treatment and recuperation and in the future it will become specialized as wellness based on prevention. It is predicted that wellness care among others will develop to become the key field of u-Healthcare. For this reason in this research, ubiquitous technology was grafted to the passometer (P-meter) which is frequently used for monitoring during existing walking exercises. Emerging from the existing method of the P-meter which simply calculates the amount of exercise by counting the number of steps taken, using the GPS incoming data, the distance and speed of the location changes is calculated and the acceleration sensor will reflect the steps and intensity of movement to measure the walking activity amount to realize a smart walker system which will help the maintenance and promotion of modernists health.In this paper, we propose an integrative remote monitoring system for measuring walking activities under ubiquitous healthcare environment considering walking effects in healthcare of human life through the calculation of the distance of location changes and speed using GPS reception data and reflecting the steps and intensity of movement using the acceleration sensor.

AB  - Stack Generalization is a general method for combining low-level classifiers to achieve high-level classifier for impetrate to higher recognition rate. This paper proposed method based on Stack Generalization that named Modified Stack Generalization. In rour proposed model, unlike the conventional stacked generalization, the combiner receives the output of base classifiers and original input directly. The experiments have been done on 780 samples of 30 city names of Iran that for different experiments different number of training and testing samples was chosen. In the feature extraction Stage Gradient, Zoning methods are used, and also other method base on Gradient is suggested. Results show that Modified Stack generalization method with the recommended feature extraction method has been achieved to 92.21% recognition rate. Furthermore, Comparison test with other combination methods indicates that the proposed method yields improved recognition rate in the Farsi handwritten word recognition.

AB  - This paper deals with partial discharge induced electromagnetic wave investigation on three-phase GIS using UHF method and the application of single-phase partial discharge monitoring device (PDM) on three-phase gas insulated switchgear (GIS). The PD source is a protrusion at different positions on the conductor or on the tank. Frequency and phase spectrums of EMW signals emitted by PD at different positions were observed. The most dominant frequency of EMW signal in three-phase GIS was estimated from the cutoff frequency (fc) formula for single-phase GIS. The main difference in frequency spectrum between three-phase and single-phase GIS was found to be the shift of fc to the lower value for three-phase GIS. The presence of three conductors can be considered as increase in an equivalent radius of three-phase conductor by a factor of 1.6 for this GIS model. The phase of PD phase pattern in the phase spectrum depended on the particle position. The PD sources on three-phase GIS were diagnosed by single-phase PDM device. The success rate of diagnosis results is low. The error is predicted to be caused by error in phase recognition of PD pattern. The change in phase shift setting of PD phase pattern in PDM device based on the phase angle of applied voltage at maximum electric field gave better diagnosis results.

AB  - This paper descirbes leakage current characters and discharge phenomenon of outdoor insulators both in the lab and in the field. The results are hoped to be used for online monitoring of the contamination levels. The following contents are introduced in the paper: Leakage current monitoring systems, relationships between leakage current and discharge phenomenon, flashover prediction methods and its applications in the field. The leakage current monitoring system is introduced firstly. Then the relationships between leakage current and discharge phenomenon for both suspension insulators and post insulators are presented based on the laboratory tests. A new parameter (I*) that accounted for maximum leakage current (Ih) and different insulator shapes is introduced to estimate the flashover voltage for different kinds of pollutant layers when they are saturated with moisture. Meanwhile, the relationships between relative humdity (RH) and maximum leakage curren, altitude and maximum leakage current are investigated. With these results a flashover prediction method is developed. Ih measured in different relative humidity is converted to I* for the same contaminate layer when it is saturated with moisture. Then the flashover voltage is estimated by I*. Furthermore, an online leakage current monitoring results are analyzed. The relationships between leakage current characters in the field and ambient relative humidity are analyzed. The results show that although there are some differences between the leakage current in the field and in the lab because of some especially serve atmospheric conditions, the relationships are similar. Meanwhile, leakage current waveforms in different weather conditions are investigated. The waveforms of leakage current in the field are similar with those in the lab. The leakage current waveform that accounted for strong arc is found in the field. Finally, the contamination level of the field insulator is evaluated. The results corresponds well with the local condition.

AB  - In this paper, a novel Set Point Weighted Proportional Integral Derivative (SPWPID) controller has been proposed for the Magnetic levitation (Maglev) system in Simulink and real time. The recently evolved Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) has been used to identify the suitable controller parameter values by optimizing the objective function. The performance of the SPWPID controller is compared with that of the PID controller, designed using TLBO. Moreover, the performance of the SPWPID controller has also been compared with the performance of the 1-DOF and 2-DOF PID controller designed for the same Maglev plant [15]. The result of the comparison shows that the SPWPID controller outperforms both the 1-DOF and 2-DOF PID controllers in terms of overshoot and settling time. The robustness analysis has also been incorporated to demonstrate the robust behavior of the plant with the SPWPID controller. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The characteristics of multiple stroke negative cloud to ground (CG) lightning flashes in Padang, Indonesia based on electric field recording were investigated. 100 negative CG lightning flashes containing 623 strokes, recorded from August to October 2014, were examined. It was observed that all first return strokes (RS) negative CG lightning flashes were preceded by preliminary breakdown pulses (PBPs). However, only 40% of the detecable PBP trains could be analyzed statistically on PBP train duration, PBP-RS separation, and PBP/RS ratio, while the detectable leader pulses was 69%. In addition, it was also found that the arithmetic mean (AM) and maximum number of strokes were 5.2 and 18, respectively. The AM and geometric mean (GM) interstroke interval were 55.34 and 34.71 ms, respectively. Furthermore, 2% of the subsequent return stroke (SRS) peak electric fields were larger than those of the first return stroke (RS). The AM and GM ratios of SRS/RS were 0.36 and 0.3, respectively. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

The antenna which has the dimension of 238.64mm x 22mm consists of 7 blocks of interdigital capacitor structure as antenna radiators and deployed on a grounded Roger RT/Duroid® 6010 dielectric substrate with the thickness of 0.127mm. The use of very thin dielectric substrate for antenna realization is aimed to have a conformable antenna which wraps around the cylindrical body of experimental rocket communication. After obtaining the optimum performance design, the proposed passive antenna is then realized through wet etching technique for experimental characterization. From the characterization result, it shows that the realized passive antenna resonates at center frequency of 2.375GHz with gain of -18.763dBi. This is comparable with the design one which has resonant frequency of 2.35GHz and gain of -19.996dBi. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nanostructured materials are attracting interests and applications, thus; physical and electrical properties of Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) nanocomposite materials under various thermal conditions are currently being studied. The dielectric behavior of new nanocomposite materials of Polymethylmethacrylate filled with nanoclay or nano-fumed silica has been measured at various frequency (0.1 kHz - 1 kHz) and temperatures (20°C-60°C). Dielectric spectroscopy has been used to characterize ionic conduction and state the effect of filler concentration on the dielectric permittivity and dielectric losses, therefore; the relative permittivity and the loss tangent are measured by dielectric spectroscopy for Polymethylmethacrylate with and without nanofillers. Finally, it has been compared between dielectric properties of new Polymethylmethacrylate nanocomposites which prepared by adding nanofillers of clay or fumed silica with different concentrations under various temperatures. © 2014, International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In this work, a combination of Economic and Emission power dispatch optimization is solved by differential evolution technique using MAT-lab programming technique. The crux of the objective is to find the economic scheduling of the generation, such that the required load demands of the generation can be satisfied and the operation such as equality and inequality constraints of the generators including the total emissions within the allowable emission limit for satisfactory operation of the thermal power plant. In this work only one emission of Nitrogen oxide is considered for analysis. The economic/environmental load dispatch is analyzed in two cases. Case one deals excluding transmission losses and case two deals including transmission losses in the system. The standard data of IEEE Thirty Bus System and Indian Utility Sixty Two Bus Test System has been taken into account and simulated with aid of MAT-lab software and results are obtained. An apposite program has been developed using differential evolution technique and which has been verified for various load demand.

AB  - This paper presents a shunt active power filter performances based on threelevel (NPC) inverter using conventional pulse width modulation (PWM) and Ann's controllers to mitigate current harmonics generated by non-linear loads. Shunt APF is the best solution to eliminate harmonics drawn from nonlinear load especially for low power system, the conventional scheme based on the two level inverter controlled by hysteresis controller presents several drawbacks such us high inverse voltage applied to power components, degraded output voltage inverter waveforms, etc. Today three-level (NPC) inverter and intelligent controllers are widely used in different industrial applications. To take advantages of these inverter topology and artificial intelligent controller performance a novel control scheme based on Ann's current controller is proposed in this work. The control strategy adopted is the synchronous current detection method, it is easy to implement and permits a good extraction of reference currents compensation. The numerical simulation is performed using MATLAB-Simulink and SimPowerSystem Toolbox. The simulation results obtained in steady and transit states show the effectiveness and the superiority of Ann systems compared to PWM controller.

AB  - Here, we describe our work in developing Indonesian Mind Map Generator that employs several Indonesian natural language understanding tools as its main engine. The Indonesian Mind Map Generator1 aims to help the user in easily making a Mind Map object. The system consists of several Indonesian natural language understanding tools such as Indonesian POS Tagger, Indonesian Syntactic Parser, and Indonesian Semantic Analyzer. The methods used for developing each of Indonesian natural language understanding tools are devised to such an extend that they are enable to alleviate the low availability of Indonesian language resources. For Indonesian POS Tagger, we employed HMM and subsequently enhanced the result by using affix tree. As for the Indonesian Syntactic Parser, we compared the performance of CYK and Earley parser, which are known as common dynamic algorithms in PCFG. The Indonesian Semantic Analyzer consists of several components such as lexical semantic attachment, reference resolution, and Semantic Analyzer itself that transforms the parse tree result into first order logic representation. In our work, instead of using a rich resource on semantic information for each vocabulary, we defined several rules for the lexical semantic attachment based on POS Tags and certain words. Finally, to develop the Mind Map generator, we used the radial drawing method to visualize the first order logic representation and we also built a Mind Map editor to allow a user in modifying the Mind Map result. To evaluate the result, we conducted the experiments for each component mentioned previously. The POS Tagger accuracy achieved 96.5%, the Syntactic Parser achieved accuracy of 47.22%, and the Semantic Analyzer achieved accuracy of 62.5%. The final result of Mind Map object was evaluated by 5 respondents. The results of evaluationshowed that, for the simple sentence, the Mind Map object can be easily understood.

AB  - This paper proposes an analytical method to solve the problem of upper body motion transfer from human to humanoid robot. By using humanoid normalized model as a model of upper body human motion, the proposed method then uses analytical inverse kinematics method to transfer human motion to humanoid robot. Because the nature of analytical method that is specific to robot with particular kinematics structure, we choose the Aldebaran NAO robot as target platform. We verify our method by using offline simulation and online experiment in the robot. The offline simulation shows that our method gives exact solution, while the online experiment gives a qualitatively good result.

AB  - This article presents an efficient approach for solving economic load dispatch (ELD) problems in different test power systems using a novel seeker optimization algorithm (SOA) In the SOA, the act of human searching capability and understanding are exploited for the purpose of optimization. In this algorithm, the search direction is based on empirical gradient by evaluating the response to the position changes and the step length is based on uncertainty reasoning by using a simple fuzzy rule. In this paper, four test systems of the ELD problems are solved by adopting the SOA. A comparison of obtained simulation results by adopting the SOA is carried out with those published in the recent literatures. It is revealed from comparison that the optimization efficacy of the SOA over the prevailing optimization techniques for the solution of the multimodal, non-differentiable, highly non-linear, and constrained ELD problems is promising.

AB  - The work presented in this paper focuses on studying the application of doubly fed induction generators in wind energy production under micro-interruption fault. In this context, the presented work set out to improve the performance of a wind turbine either from an energetic efficiency, or from the arrangement with behavioral of grid disturbances. To reach the maximum wind power extraction, wind turbine has to reduce their disconnection. For this reason grid operators impose, by theirs grid connection requirements, to wind turbine producer to support some grid disturbance. This paper deals with the behavior of wind turbine equipped with a Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) under micro-interruption. A scheme tolerant micro-interruption, by using a crow bar system, is proposed. A control strategy of the Unified Power Flow Control (UPFC) using PI controller is presented. And finally fuzzy logic controller is illustrated and compared to PI controller.

AB  - Ceramic insulators are widely used in transmission as well as in distribution lines. As outdoor insulators, the ceramic insulators are subjected to environmental stresses. In particular case, the insulators may severe high pollution exposure. Under the polluted condition, high leakage current will flow on the insulator surface and dry band arching may take place. The phenomena may initiate the insulator flash over leading to the failure of the lines. Several efforts may be taken to improve the insulator performance under polluted condition. Recently, adding of hidrophobic agent on the insulators was introduced to improve the performance of ceramic insulators under polluted condition. This paper reports the experimental results on the application of room temperature vulcanized (RTV) silicone rubber coating on the medium voltage ceramic insulators under various environmental conditions. The samples were put in a test chamber with controlled humidity and pollution condition. The characteristics of RTV Silicon Rubber coated insulator were analyzed, such as its leakage current (LC), hydrophobicity (indicated by measuring contact angle) and Surface Smoothness (indicated by Scanned Electron Microscopy (SEM)) of the RTV Silicon Rubber insulator surface. The LC's waveform parameters such as magnitude and harmonic content (as indicated by the total harmonics distortion (THD)) were analyzed. It was found that the coating was significantly suppressed the magnitude of leakage current and drastically eliminated the harmonic content. The gradient of cross product value between LC magnitude and THD was proved to be a better indicator to show insulator condition rather than LC or THD alone. The coating also significantly increased the flash over voltage of the insulator. Surface analysis indicated that increasing of the water repellence and enhancement of surface resistance of the insulators played important role in the increase of the insulator performances. These experimental results will be the basis of application of RTV Silicon Rubber coated insulator under polluted conditions, especially in Indonesia.

AB  - The use of the isolated hybrid power systems is being popular due to the continuous increasing gap between demand and supply of conventional energy sources and intermittent nature of non-conventional energy sources. Normally, the non-conventional energy source such as wind have induction generator to generate electricity but induction generators require reactive power for its operation and this demand is continuously changing by the variation of load and wind power. The synchronous generator used in hybrid system for generating power through diesel system is supplying reactive power to the system partially; therefore, another source of reactive power is required to fulfill this demand. In this paper, the static VAR compensator (SVC) and static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) using a proportional-integral controller (PI) are used as reactive power compensator. The dynamic performance of SVC and STATCOM are investigated for wind-diesel and wind-dieselmicrohydro power systems ate constant slip operation of induction generators. The results show that the STATCOM is a better option than that of SVC for reactive power control of the hybrid system.

AB  - Economic load dispatch is the process of allocating the required load demand between the available generators in power system while satisfying all units and system equality and inequality constraints. Economic Load Dispatch solutions are found by solving the conventional methods such as lambda iteration, Gradient search method, Linear Programming and Dynamic Programming while at the same minimizing fuel costs, but convergence is too slow, so in order to get fast convergence and accurate results we are using artificial neural network. Artificial neural network is well-known in the area of power systems. It is a very powerful solution algorithm because of its rapid convergence near the solution. This property is especially useful for power system applications because an initial guess near the solution is easily attained. In this paper a three generator system is considered and by using lambda iteration method Economic Load Dispatch is determined and 150 patterns for different loads will be derived from same method to train neural network. As it is too slow method, we proposed a soft computing based approach i.e. Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) for determining the optimal flow. This method provides fast and accurate results when compared with the conventional method. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Determination of the optimal configurations of N identical point charges on a unit sphere, known as Thomson’s problem, is a well-known energy optimization problem in physics. In this paper we have determined the minimum energy for various values of N using Symbiotic Organisms Search (SOS) algorithm, up to N = 200. The energy values considered in the study are found to be in good agreement with the existing values. Results are presented for various values of N ranging from 3 to 200 along with the convergence graph. We found that SOS algorithm provides better optimal values of energy compared to hybrid approach of Evolutionary algorithm and Spectral Gradient for unconstrained condition (EA_SG2) method. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of unknown etiology. It causes, during its course, vocal impairment in approximately 90% of patients. PD patients suffer from hypokinetic dysarthria, which manifests in all aspects of speech production: respiration, phonation, articulation, nasality and prosody. To evaluate these, clinicians have adopted perceptual methods, based on acoustic cues, to distinguish different disease states. In order to improve these evaluations, we used a variety of voice samples comprising the numbers from 1 to 10, four rhymed sentences, nine Turkish words plus the sustained vowels “a”, “o”, and “u”. Samples were collected from 40 people, 20 with PD. We used the method of Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) validation with a K Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier with its different types of kernels, (i.e.; RBF, Linear, polynomial and MLP). The best result obtained was 82.5% using two diffirent voice samples; 1-the 4 th acoustic features along with the 17 th voice samples; 2-The 3 th and the 5 th acoustic features along with 20th voice sample. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Optimal planning of electric distribution networks is a complicated multi-objective and multi-constraint problem. This context will be more challenging, regards to the constraints rising from the nature of smart grids. Optimal planning in such a network needs advanced strategies which consider both technical and economical aspects. Distributed generation (DG) and Capacitor banks have attracted a great attention due to their ability in power loss reduction; voltage profile adjustment; voltage stability improvement and emissions reduction. Ever increasing use of electricity imposes a need to enhance the accountability of the power system and improve the system performance parameters. In the literatures, the optimal sizing and siting of several combinations of DGs and/or capacitors have been studied considering different objective functions. The differences are mainly in the problem formulation, methodology and constraints. In this paper, a new approach for optimal allocation of DGs and Capacitor banks, separately and simultaneously, is proposed. The proposed scheme evaluates both the technical and economical aspects with considering several objective functions. The proposed method can easily be expanded with more objectives to cover all the network planners’ preferences. The proposed scheme is the combination of an intelligent algorithm and data envelopment analysis (DEA). So, in this paper firstly intelligent algorithm is applied to the sitting and sizing problem, and then the obtained optimal solutions are prioritized by DEA. The significant advantage of using DEA is that, there is no need to impose the decision maker’s idea into the model. And ranking is done, based on the efficiencies of the optimal solutions. The most efficient solution is the one which has improved network parameters considerably and has lowest costs. So, using DEA gives a realistic view of solutions and the provided results are for all, not for a specific decision maker. The proposed scheme is applied on a 33-bus radial distribution network and the obtained results are discussed which are satisfactory. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper presents some improvements on the Multihost Multistage Vulnerability Analysis (MulVAL) framework. MulVAL is a framework to generate an attack graph for analysis of a computer network security risk. In MulVAL, it is assumed that the probability of success in exploiting the machine configuration and vulnerability variable is 100%, and the vulnerability variables are independent of each other. In reality each machine has its own security configuration issue, and vulnerabilities are not independent of each other. Moreover the research in MulVAL attack graph solely focuses on the probability of vulnerability, whereas the probability of vulnerability in security configuration is not covered. In this paper we introduce three methods to improve the MulVAL framework. In the first method we employ Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) for calculating the probability of vulnerability variables, and Common Configuration Scoring System (CCSS) for calculating the probability of vulnerability of system security configuration. In the second method we introduce the interdependence of vulnerability variables in Bayesian senses. Finally, in the third method we analyze the impact of the change in system security configuration to the probability of vulnerability in the context of Bayesian probability. We analyze and discuss the proposed methods through a simulation for a simple network configuration. The simulation results of the proposed methods demonstrate that the introduction of CVSS, CCSS, employing dependency of vulnerability variables and system security configuration represent a more realistic model for vulnerability in MulVAL framework. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - A battery Energy storage system (BESS) based voltage and frequency controller (VFC), for an Autonomous Asynchronous Generator (ASG) driven by an uncontrolled pico hydro turbine used in constant power mode, is presented in this paper. Excitation of the asynchronous generator with capacitor bank enables it to generate rated voltage at no load. The additional reactive power demand of the ASG on load and that for the load itself is provided by the VFC. The proposed controller has the capability of harmonic reduction, load balancing and load leveling along with voltage and frequency control. The VFC has been realized using an IGBT based current controlled voltage source converter (CC-VSC) having a battery at its DC link. A simple and effective linear control scheme using SPWM control has been used to control the CC-VSC. This control scheme is easier to implement on hardware than the other reported schemes, as it involves only linear PI controllers. The effectiveness of the proposed controller for an autonomous generator is demonstrated by simulation on MATLAB platform.

AB  - This paper presents an exact input-output linearization control scheme for rotor speed and rotor flux control of induction motor drive. In this scheme the motor model, is described in the fixed stator frame, and it is linearized, using exact inputoutput linearization technique, allowing a decoupled control of rotor flux and torque. To avoid the use of mechanical sensor, the rotor speed estimation is made by an observer using a specific MRAS (Model reference adaptive system) technique; this observer is designed to perform simultaneous estimation of stator resistance and rotor speed. In order to estimate rotor flux, a sliding mode observer is proposed in this paper. Simulation results are realized and presented to validate and to prove the effectiveness of the proposed Sensorless control.

The power generated is transmitted through a large network and significant power losses in transmission and distribution feeders. Loss reduction through various methods has the potential to yield huge savings in economic growth and environmental impact. One such effective loss minimization method is to inject reactive power by placing shunt capacitors at appropriate places with proper size. A Harmony Search Algorithm methodology is proposed in this work to identify the appropriate size of shunt capacitors by taking the objective as minimizing the cost associated with real power losses along with installation cost of shunt capacitors in an unbalanced radial distribution network. The bus voltage limits, number/size of installed capacitors at each node are taken as constraints. A two stage methodology is adopted in this work to get the solution of the optimization problem. In the first stage, the voltage stability index values at each bus is computed and the node with minimum value of voltage stability index is identified as the most receptive node to voltage slump and such a node is considered as candidate node for installation of shunt capacitors. In the second stage the HSA methodology is used to ascertain the suitable capacitor size. The backward / forward sweep algorithm based Radial distribution load flow algorithm is utilized for power flow simulation. The proposed Harmony Search Algorithm is implemented on the modified IEEE 13 and 37 bus URDN.

AB  - The power quality enhancement is very mandatory with the newer generation load equipments, whose performance is very sensitive to power quality disturbances especially with voltage sag, Harmonics and Interruption. The power electronic based power conditioning devices can be the effective solution to enhance the quality of the power supplied to the power distribution system. The series connected Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) is one of the effective solution to mitigate power quality problems in the distribution system. In this paper, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) controlled DVR is designed and the performance of the rectifier load connected system is investigated with conventional Proportional-Integral (PI) controller. The Levenberg-Marquardt (LV) Back propagation algorithm is used to implement the control scheme of the Voltage Source Inverter (VSI). The ANN is trained offline using data from PI controller. In addition to the compensation of voltage sag and harmonics, the DVR is also used to protect a linear load from various disturbances in the source voltage. Three different types of faults with two level of voltage sag are analyzed and the performance of DVR with these disturbances is modeled using MATLAB/SIMULINK. The comprehensive result of the PI and ANN controllers are also presented.

AB  - In this paper, the transmission loss reduction for circular terahertz waveguide is investigated using dielectric-lined method. As is well known, the guided terahertz radiation suffers from high transmission loss due to the increase of ohmic loss and the lack of dielectric materials which has sufficiently transparency. As the existence of transmission loss, the quality of communication is therefore affected thoroughly. Here, the modification of hollow circular metallic terahertz waveguide by coating the inner surface of waveguide walls using some dielectric material, i.e. polystyrene, called as dielectric-lined method is proposed to reduce the transmission loss. The investigation is performed at THz frequencies from 0.1THz to 1.0THz including the analysis of transmission loss for each resonance mode and frequency band. The result shows that the proposed method with 15μm thickness of polystyrene coating is successfully decreasing the transmission loss for the TE01 wave mode below 1dB/m with smaller amplitude of electric field around the inner surface of waveguide walls. Furthermore, the discussion of investigation results for diameter variation and different thicknesses of polystyrene coating is also presented.

AB  - Traditionally simple object is drawn to the screen by drawing functions in pixels, so the slight different form of object should be redrawn by different function. On the other hand, naturally fractal object is drawn by a single algorithm through drawing pixels at the position according to the code of fractal such as IFS code, and interactively to change the form of or to animate the fractal object is accomplished simply by changing the code of fractal at any time. So in this case, animation model of objects in fractal form has an advantage over animation model of objects in traditional form. IFS code is one way of the inverse problem representation of object in fractal form. The IFS fractal objects can be reconstructed by random iteration algorithm and the multi-object of fractal can be reconstructed by partitioned-random iteration algorithm from the IFS code sets. To have the metamorphic animation, the interpolation between the IFS code of source and target objects can be done by a metamorphic animation algorithm. The hybrid animation model is the combination model of a metamorphic animation on one type of object and the multi-object animation independently with or without synchronized mode based on the metamorphic interpolation of IFS code coefficients for the metamorphic animation and the partitioned-random iteration algorithm for the multiobject animation.

AB  - Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is a well-approved technique to diagnose incipient faults in liquid-filled transformers. It is usually performed by periodically sampling liquids from power transformers and analyzing the dissolved gases in laboratories. In the past decade, the emergence of multi-gas online monitors avails a much timelier monitoring for transformers. However, it is still not certain whether the monitor readings are accurate and reliable and whether they agree with laboratory results. This raises additional concerns when applying natural esters in power transformers. This paper comparatively studied the lab and online fault gas measurement results of a mineral oil and a natural ester under various faults, including thermal faults, partial discharge faults and sparking faults. The results show that the online gas measurement results agree with the laboratory analysis generally within an error of 30%. Gas leakage or air ingression might occur during the transport of liquid samples for laboratory analysis. Therefore, liquid samples should be analyzed as soon as sampled for laboratory analysis.

AB  - Polymer nanocomposites for HV insulation have been extensively being studied in recent years because of its unique properties and ability to enhance electrical performance. Electrical conduction of polymer nanocomposites have been used as one of the tool to monitor its dielectric behaviour. This paper present the experiment result for polarization and depolarization current and conductivity value to find the patterns and trends of DC conductivity. Then this experiment result will be compared with results from previous researches studies on current and conductivity analysis with different method and samples. The analysis result shown that DC conductivity exhibits significant reduction with addition of any types of nanofiller at right amount. However right percentage of nanofiller added is not same for different type of materials. This was due to decreasing of initiation probability of short circuit treeing in the insulation. The conductivity analysis shows that addition of nanofiller into the polymer improved its insulation properties.

AB  - In wireless OFDM systems, a major cause for signal degradation during transmission is high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR). Selected mapping (SLM) is one efficient technique which reduces the peaks of a signal considerably. One drawback associated with this technique is its computational complexity. The computational complexity is directly related to the complexity of the IFFT block and increases as the number of sub-carriers increases. In this paper, an effort is done to reduce the computational complexity as well as to improve the PAPR performance of the conventional SLM technique. The proposed technique called Partial Selected Mapping in which the IFFT block is divided into smaller blocks and each block is used as a separate SLM block. Partial outputs of all sub-blocks are concatenated to form the final sequence. Simulation results show that the overall computational complexity of the proposed technique is lower than that of the conventional SLM technique with better PAPR performance. A reduction of around 3dB in PAPR performance at CCDF of 10-3 is achieved.

AB  - This paper presents Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based approach for the allocation & coordinated operation of multiple FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission System) devices for the economic operation as well as to increase power transfer capacity of an interconnected power system under different loading condition. The PSO based approach is applied on IEEE 30-bus system. The system is reactively loaded starting from base to 200 % of base load. FACTS devices are installed in the different locations of the power system and system performance is noticed with and without FACTS devices. First, the locations, where the FACTS devices to be placed is determined by calculating active and reactive power flows in the lines. A Particle Swarm Optimization based algorithm is then applied to find the amount of magnitudes of the FACTS devices. This Particle Swarm Optimization based approach for the placement of FACTS devices Yields promising result both in terms of performance and economy which is clearly observed from the result obtained.

AB  - Voltage stability condition, reliability and service quality are the important parameters of a distribution system which need to be satisfied from the customer point of view.To measure voltage stability of distribution network a voltage stability index is presented in this paper. Voltage stability improvement of network is facilated by network reconfiguration and voltage stability level is quantified by voltage stability index. Network reconfiguration is a process which alters the feeder topological structure by changing the open/close status of the sectionalizing (normally closed) and ties switches (normally open) in the system. In this work, a two stage search of switching option i.e. local search and global search is implemented to achieve desired network configuration. A multilayer ANN model with Error Back Propagation Learning (EBPL) algorithm is simulated for global search to obtained optimal set of candidate switching. The proposed scheme is tested on an 11 kV practical radial distribution system consisting of 52 buses. After reconfiguration, better voltage stable condition of the system is attained. Active power loss of the system is reduced from 0.854 MW to 0.485 MW and reactive power loss of the system is reduced from 0.355MVar to 0.199MVar after achieving optimal configuration.

AB  - A simple algorithm to improve the identification accuracy of protein coding regions (exons) in Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) sequences exploiting period-3 property is proposed. Three base periodicity is quite pronounced in exons and is commonly used in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) based methods to locate the exonic regions. Improvement in the accuracy of the protein coding regions has been achieved by extracting the background noise that comes from long range correlation present in DNA sequences and then eliminating this noise from the period-3 power spectrum. Proposed algorithm is data independent as it does not requires the empirical determination of any parameter for increasing the discrimination between coding and non-coding regions of a DNA sequence. Performance of the algorithm has been evaluated on F56F11 C.elegans chromosome-III nucleotide sequences. Performance of this algorithm has been compared with the spectral content method and an improvement in the correlation coefficient (CC), the performance metric used in this work, is observed.

AB  - Interleaved boost converter is well suited for high power and high performance applications. This paper investigates the performance of three-phase uncoupled and directly coupled Interleaved Boost Converter (IBC) for fuel cell applications. By employing directly coupled inductors for IBC, the overall current ripple can be effectively reduced which increases the lifetime of fuel cells. In this paper, a three phase interleaved boost converter using CoolMOS and Silicon Carbide (SiC) diode has been proposed for fuel cells compared to the classical IBC reported in the literature. Mathematical analysis of overall current ripple and the design equations for IBC has been presented. Analysis based on the relationship between current ripples and operating conditions such as duty cycle and coupling coefficient has been investigated for uncoupled and directly coupled IBC. The performance parameter of IBC such as switching losses and efficiency has been studied. Simulation of IBC interfaced with Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells has been studied using MATLAB/SIMULINK. Experimental prototype has been built to validate the results.

AB  - In operation and planning of the power systems, the analysis of the consumption trends depends on the evolution of economic activities and competition among several sources of energy, which affect forecasts. The loads estimation represents the basis of the system state estimation and influences various aspects of power system planning such as: transformer and conductor sizing, capacitor bank placement and so on. The main difficulties in modeling of the nodal loads result from the random nature of loads, the deficiency of measured data and the fragmentary and uncertain character of information on loads and customers. Thus, a modern method for expressing the uncertainty in load models is fuzzy technique. A fuzzy set is a set containing elements that have varying degrees of membership in the set. There are different ways to derive membership functions. Subjective judgment, intuition and expert knowledge are commonly used in constructing membership function. Because in many situations the choices of the membership functions are subjective, in the paper the clustering techniques are proposed for the improved of the defining of membership functions corresponding to the load profiles and customers consumption categories. Results obtained demonstrate the ability of the fuzzy load models to overcome difficult aspects encountered in process control and operation problems.

AB  - This paper presents the comparison of Carrier Overlapping Pulse Width Modulation (COPWM) techniques for the Diode clamped Multi Level Inverter (DCMLI). Due to switch combination redundancies, there are certain degrees of freedom to generate the five level AC output voltage. This paper presents the use of Control Freedom Degree (CFD) combination. The effectiveness of the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) strategies developed using CFD are demonstrated by simulation and experimentation. The results indicate that the multilevel inverter triggered by the developed COPWM-A strategy exhibits reduced harmonics. PWM strategies developed are implemented in real time using dSPACE/Real Time Interface (RTI). The simulation and experimental results closely match with each other validating the strategies presented.

AB  - Sigma delta modulators (ΣΔMs) form part of the core of today's mixed-signal designs. The ongoing research on these devices shows the potential of ΣΔ data converters as a promising candidate for high-speed, high-resolution, and low-power mixed-signal interfaces. This work presents a new accurate behavioral model of a second order law-pass Switched Capacitor (SC) Sigma-Delta modulator. Our main contribution consists to predict the effect of almost sources of noise on the operation of sigma delta modulator such as non idealities of op-amp and switches. The purpose of this work is the presentation of a behavioral model of a second order switched capacitor ΣΔ modulator considering (Error due to Clock Jitter, Thermal noise Amplifier Noise, Amplifier Slew-Rate, Non linearity of amplifiers, Gain error, Charge Injection, Clock Feed-through, and Nonlinear onresistance). A comparison between the use of MOS switches and the use transmission gate switches use is analyzed.

AB  - This paper presents an improved method for determining the share of harmonic distortion generated by utility and customer in a distribution system. The method is based on a Norton equivalent circuit to represent the whole system, modeling the customer side with RLC components by using measured voltage and current at the point of common coupling (PCC). The proposed method evaluates the contribution of harmonic voltage and current distortion, which may appear from utility and customer sides of the system. Several case studies have been made to verify the accuracy of the method in determining the share of utility and customer harmonic distortions. Results showed that the proposed method can accurately determine harmonic contributions of utility and customer sides for measurement made at the PCC.

AB  - In this paper, a new means for characterization of switchable substrateless frequency selective surfaces (FSS) was demonstrated with numerical and experimental approaches. The diodes model loaded active doubly periodic flat strip FSS acts as a dynamic screen, in which its surface reflectivity and transmittivity can be switched alternately and tuned through d.c. bias voltage control. The properties of FSS layer are characterized using a specially designed parallel plate waveguide (PPW) simulator that permits normal incidence excitation of the FSS under test and the responses are found between 3 to 5 GHz. It is shown that by means of d.c. bias control, the screen can be utilized in, (a) transmission mode as a dual band electromagnetic shutter, or, (b) reflection mode, as an amplitude shift keying (ASK) spatial modulator or dual band reflection canceller. In addition a hybrid de-embedding technique is employed to remove the influence the PPW simulator and reveal the true property of substrateless FSS. Typical experimental results are presented and validated against a new 3D electromagnetic (EM) modeling led de-embedding method for the composite FSS layer and PPW structure.

AB  - Surface Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is the one of Radar technology that is widely used on many applications. It is non-destructive remote sensing method to detect underground buried objects. However, the output target is only hyperbolic representation. This research tries to enhance GPR capability by representing the visual/pattern of the detected target. GPR data of many basic objects (with circular, triangular and rectangular cross-section) are classified and extracted to generate data training model as a unique template for each type basic object. The pattern of object under test will be known by comparing its data with the training data using a decision tree method. A simple powerful algorithm to extract feature parameters of object which based on linier extrapolation is proposed. The result shown that tested buried basic objects can be correctly interpreted.

AB  - In the last three decades, light emitting diodes (LEDs) had a huge improvement in technical implication due to its excellent advantages such as long lifetime, compactness, high luminous efficiency, environment factor, and low cost. In this paper, the improvement of optical properties (color rending index and color quality scale) of the white LEDs by adding scattering enhancement particles CaCO3, CaF2, SiO2, and TiO2 to the yellow-emitting YAG:Ce phosphor compounding was investigated. In the beginning, we built the physical model of multi-chip W-LEDs (MCW-LEDs) by using commercial LightTools 8.1.0 program. After that, we investigated, calculated and analyzed the influence of scattering enhancement particles on the color rending index (CRI) and color quality scale (CQS) of MCW-LEDs. Finally, the results were demonstrated the Mie-scattering theory with using the Mat lab software. The results indicated that all CaCO3, CaF2, SiO2 and TiO2 particles are influenced by the optical properties of MCW-LEDs. The highest CRI and CQS of W-LEDs can be obtained by adding CaCO3 particles. This results and discussion provided important technical implication for materials development of MCW-LED applications. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - As the penetration of the Wind Energy Generation System (WEGS) into the modern power systems is extensively increased, an efficient control strategy of a WEGS plays an essential role in wind power utilization. This study presents Sliding Mode Control (SMC) design for the Variable Speed Wind Farm Systems (VS-WFS) based on Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) and interconnected to the electric network. The proposed control laws are used to regulate both grid-side and generator converters. The generator side converters are used to track the maximum wind power. The function of the grid side inverter is to transfer the total extracted wind power from DC-link to the electric network and regulate the DC-link voltage. A SMC scheme is developed in the sense of Lyapunov stability theorem for the VS-WFS. Besides, the effectiveness of the proposed SMC scheme is demonstrated by comparison with a traditional Proportional Integral (PI) control strategy for fault conditions as well as for normal working conditions. Simulation results with Matlab/Simulink environment are presented to support the theoretical considerations demonstrating the potential contributions of both control strategies. The proposed SMC scheme can provide excellent control performance than the traditional PI strategy. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Induction motor with indirect field oriented control is preferred for high performance applications due to its excellent dynamic behavior. However, it is sensitive to variations in rotor time constant, especially variation in rotor resistance which needs to be estimated online. Conventionally the model reference adaptive system with fuzzy logic controllers as adaptation is used, which works satisfactorily for one particular operating condition and fails under variable operating condition. Therefore the need arises for a fuzzy controller whose parameters are tuned using evolutionary algorithm. In this paper, the input/output gain and the membership function parameters of the fuzzy system are optimized using genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization to obtain an optimal designed fuzzy controller for rotor resistance estimation. The system is investigated in MATLAB/Simulink environment. Results shows that the steady state error in estimation of rotor resistance by the proposed controller under stringent operating condition is better with the proposed controller as compared to the conventional trial and error based fuzzy controller. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Photovoltaic (PV) panels are subjected to problems such as hot spots and reduced output power when operating in partially shaded conditions. Although bypass diodes are utilized to alleviate these problems, the diodes cause multiple-peak characteristics. Tracking the maximum output power in partially shaded conditions is difficult using conventional software-based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques. Curve tracers can assist software-based MPPT to track the true/global maximum power point (MPP) by scanning several potential MPP areas. Therefore, a software-based MPPT with an I-V curve tracer is a preferred solution. Moreover, curve tracers reveal more about the PV array performance and the fastest method to do so. This paper investigates the advantages and disadvantages of several I-V curve tracers and proposes a load self-adaptive PV panel characteristic curve tracer by applying a hysteretic selfcontrolled duty-modulated load resistor (DMLR) to a boost converter I-V curve tracer. Several advantages are achieved such as simple structure, cost-efficient implementation and no tracing limitation near the Voc. A circuit for 72 W PV panel is used to verify the feasibility of the proposed curve tracer. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics .All right reserved.

AB  - A Stepped-Frequency Continuous Wave (SFCW) radar performs imaging by transmitting a number of electromagnetic tones whose frequency is increased step-wisely to obtain an equivalent representation of a signal in frequency domain, then Fourier inversion is conducted to obtain a range profile. A Compressive Sampling (CS) SFCW radar reduces measurement time by randomly selecting a small number of the tones, followed by CS reconstruction. This paper shows empirically, that the knowledge of typical magnitude spectrum of the radar’s signal can be used to improve the CS-SFCW radar system in term of either better reconstruction quality or less number of required samples. Instead of random selection, the knowledge of the spectrum is used to select the best set of frequencies, by applying equipartition of energy sampling (EES) principle. Three sampling schemes, i.e., Frequency Equidistant Sampling (FES), Uniform Random Sampling (URS), and the proposed EES, are used to obtain the samples of both simulated and actual A-scan data and then identical CS reconstruction methods are applied. Objective performance evaluation in term of PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) shows that reconstructed result of URS outperforms the FES, while the EES outperforms both of them. © 2014, International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper deals with partial discharge (PD) measurement in gas insulated switchgear (GIS) using spiral antenna as UHF external sensor. PD detection in UHF band is effective because it detects electromagnetic (EM) wave induced by PD with high S/N ratio. External sensor was used to detect leaked EM wave signals from insulation spacer of GIS tank. The experiment was conducted in 66 kV GIS model with metal type spacer. There is insulation window in the spacer. PD was generated by some artificial defects in GIS and an external PD source. The leaked EM wave propagated through spacer aperture was measured using spiral type sensor without filter and amplifier. The peak to peak value (Vpp) and the transmission rate of electromagnetic wave signals were evaluated. The PD patterns were observed. The results showed that the PD was detected by the spiral antenna. PD pattern was unique for each defect. These results are considered to be useful for enhancement of database PD diagnosis.

AB  - In a multiple area power system power can be transferred from one area to other to improve the load factor, reliability, security and economics of the power system. The generation cost of each unit in an area and the cost of power transfer from other area are given. For a given load in an area the problem is how much power to be generated internally by all the generating units in the area (unit wise) and how power has to be transferred (pooled) from other area for a given total load demand in the area (for economic operation of the power system). This problem has been solved using Lagrange multiplier method recently. The limitation of this method is that it is applicable only if the generation cost of each generating unit is quadratic. Sometimes the power generation cost of each unit is not quadratic but is other type of nonlinear function e.g. the valve-point effect problem it is addition of quadratic and sinusoidal function. The main objective of this paper is to overcome this limitation by solving this general type of nonlinear optimal problem using a Meta heuristic method, PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) and its variants. It is to point out that for implementation of PSO it is required to select a population size. Generally the population size is selected on adhoc basis. This effects the computation time as well as number of iteration for solution. A method has been suggested to select population size on the basis of optimal computation time as second objective. The method is explained by an example. The results obtained by PSO and its variants are compared among themselves and with the results obtained by analytical method. MATLAB 7 software is used for computation.

AB  - This Paper deals with the Price Based Load Frequency Control (PBLFC) using optimizedgain of integralcontroller with three different system marginal cost cases of single area four generator schemes. Case one having System Marginal Cost (SMC) value more than the nominal Unscheduled Interchange (UI) rate. Case two having system marginal cost value less than the nominal UI rate. Case three illustrates about the peak load condition following sudden loss of large generation to see whether PBLFC can handle such event or not. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique has been used to optimize gain of integral controllers in case one and two. An attempt has been made to achieve effective system frequency response using optimized gain controllers and also to explore the change in profit earned by Generation Companies (Gencos) in both the cases. For the analysis, UI rate of the year 2012, issued by Central Electricity Regulation Commission (CERC, INDIA) is used.

AB  - This study presents coordinated control tuning of power system stabilizer (PSS) with series and shunt FACTS controllers. Here thyristor controlled series compensator (TCSC) and static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) based controllers are coordinated to enhance the damping of power oscillations and to improve voltage stability. The design of proposed damping controller is formulated as an optimization problem and the controller gains of a non-linear power system are optimized instantaneously using advanced adaptive particle swarmoptimization (AAPSO). Here the power system employed with PSS,TCSC and STATCOM. To compare the performance of proposed controller four different control schemes employed on test power system. Finally, the proposed coordinated controller performance is discussed with time domain simulations. Wide ranges of loading conditions are employed on the test system to test the robustness of proposed coordinate controller and the simulation results are compared with different control schemes.

AB  - Self-excited induction generators (SEIG) are mostly exploited in isolated areas to generate electrical energy. However, an isolated induction generator should have a control system that keeps the DC bus voltage at a constant value when the speed of the rotor and load are varied. The control scheme has been presented to maintain the DC bus voltage constant to operate dc motor loaded with a centrifugal pump at its rated voltage under variable wind speed. It also shows the behavior of the pumping systems. The computer simulations are provided to verify the validity of the proposed control algorithm.

AB  - Fuzzy based stochastic algorithms for solving Multi-objective Reactive Power Optimization (MORPO) problem including FACTS devices is presented in this paper. The Multi-Objective Reactive Power Optimization problem is formulated as a nonlinear constrained multi-objective optimization problem where the active power, voltage deviation and investment cost has to be minimized simultaneously. Fuzzy logic strategy incorporated with Evolutionary Programming (EP), Tabu search (TS) algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has been proposed to handle the problem as a true multi-objective problem. The proposed algorithm has been used to solve the MORP problem with and without FACTS devices namely STATCOM, TCSC and UPFC.IEEE 30-bus system is used as a test system. The simulation results are promising and show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

AB  - In a restructured electricity market environment, the competition in the production and consumption of electric energy leads to the transmission network operating at or beyond one or more transfer limits. Then the system gets congested, resulting in an increase in the cost of electricity and the system security as well as reliability are said to be in danger. The selection of generators to reschedule their output for effective management of congestion is a crucial task for the system operator. This paper presents a differential evolution algorithm based on power flow tracing approach for selection and rescheduling of active power output. The proposed method is demonstrated on IEEE 30 bus and Indian utility 62 bus systems.

AB  - In this paper an analysis is made of the filter characteristics of the popular low pass planar filter originally designed by J.S Hong and M.J Lancaster. It is noticed that a spurious harmonic at 2.9 GHz appear in the filter characteristics. This paper presents a novel design of a wide stop band low pass planar filter using defected ground structure, which eliminates the 2.9 GHz harmonic from the filter output. The simulation and analysis of the low pass planar filter is performed using the Ansoft HFSS v11 simulator. Snapshots of the simulation and the graphical results obtained after suppression are shown in the paper, to establish the suitability of using defected ground structure for this low pass planar filter.

AB  - In this paper, a rectangular to circular waveguide converter is investigated numerically and characterized experimentally for microwave devices characterization. The converter is designed as an excitation method of circular waveguide to produce its dominant mode as the problem of circular waveguide in the excitation process. A WR248 type rectangular waveguide transducer with working frequency of 2.60-3.95GHz for TE10 mode is used as the wave exciter to be converted to a WC248 type circular waveguide. Prior to the fabrication, physical parameters of converter including length of rectangular segment, length of transition segment and length of circular segment are analyzed to obtain the optimum design. It shows that the length of transition segment affects to the return loss of converter and its length to produce TE11 mode of circular waveguide smoothly has to be more than twice of waveguide wavelength. From the result, the length of transition segment is chosen to be 275mm as it demonstrates better return loss compared to other lengths almost in the designated working frequency. To verify the design result, the prototype of converter is then realized and characterized experimentally. Furthermore, some discussion related to the results of experimental characterization is also presented.

AB  - Networked Control Systems (NCS) is a control system in which the sensors, controllers, and the actuators are connected via communication network. The use of communication network will lead to intermittent losses or delays of the information and may decrease the performance and cause instability. This paper presents the design of H∞ state feedback controller for NCS. The NCS is modelled as a time delay system. Two network features are considered: signal transmission delay and data packet dropout. Our objective is focused on the design of state feedback controller which guarantee asymptotic stability of the closed-loop systems. The proposed methods are given in the terms of Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI). Finally, we consider an unstable system for numerical example. It is shown that the state feedback controller proposed here make the closed-loop system stable with or without input disturbance.

AB  - Overhead conductor sag may be measured by different methods. In the paper measurement of sag of 66KV power transmission line under shut down conditions at no wind load using standard handheld GPS receiver BT 359 has done. The real time direct measurement of overhead conductor sag is needed for the operation of power transmission system. The measurement of conductor tension, temperature and ambient weather conditions are not required to monitor in this method. The digital signal processing (DSP) techniques is used to get better accuracy of GPS measurements. The Least Square Parameter Estimation (LSPE) method for the error estimation of GPS measurements is also incorporated.

AB  - In this contribution, a control scheme based on multi input multi output Fuzzy Sliding Mode control (MIMO-FSMC) for linear speed regulation of winding system is proposed. Once the decoupled model of the winding system is obtained, a smooth control function with a threshold was chosen to indicate how far the state from to the sliding surface is. However, the magnitude of this control function depends closely on the upper bound of uncertainties, and this generates chattering. So, this magnitude has to be chosen with great care to obtain high performances. Usually the upper bound of uncertainties is difficult to known before motor operation, so, a Fuzzy Sliding Mode controller is investigated to solve this difficulty, a simple Fuzzy inference mechanism is used to reduce the chattering phenomenon by simple adjustments. A simulation study is carried out and shows that the proposed fuzzy sliding mode controllers have great potential for use as an alternative to the conventional sliding mode control.

AB  - Lumped components are used to represent the reflectarrays designed using different commercially available materials. The loss performance and the effect of material properties on the reflectarray antennas are discussed in terms of the lumped components which are used in the equivalent circuit analysis. The bandwidth performance of reflectarrays designed with different materials is discussed using reflection loss and reflection phase plots obtained by equivalent circuit analysis. Furthermore the results obtained by equivalent circuit modeling are compared with the results obtained using CST Microwave Studio simulations and a close agreement between all the results has been demonstrated. The dielectric permittivity (ε r) of materials investigated in this work ranges between 2.08 to 13 and the loss tangent (tanδ) values vary from 0.0003 to 0.025 while the reflection loss values obtained by equivalent circuit analysis varied from 0.179 dB to 6.875 dB and a variation in 10% and 20% bandwidth is observed from 84 MHz to 360 MHZ and 126 MHZ to 540 MHz respectively based on the respective material properties.

AB  - This paper proposes an application of a new hybrid approach combining Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimal Load Frequency Control (LFC) design in interconnected power system. The proposed hybrid GA-PSO technique was applied to obtain the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller parameters. The random nature of the GA operators makes the algorithm sensitive to initial population. However the GA algorithm may not converge if the initial population is not well selected. On other hand, PSO was shown to converge rapidly during the initial stages of a global search, but around global optimum, the search process will become very slow. The main idea of this paper is to propose a new algorithm which combines GA and PSO to solve the frequency regulation problem in interconnected power system. Time domain performance of the LFC controller, such as the maximum overshoot and settling time are being optimized based on the performance criteria like the Integral Square Error (ISE), Integral Absolute Error (IAE), Integral Time multiply Absolute Error (ITAE) and Integral Time multiply Square Error (ITSE), or their combination. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, initially a two-area power system is used then the proposed approach was extended to the three-area interconnected power system. The obtained simulation results are compared to those yielded by the other classical and heuristic optimization techniques surfaced in the recent state-of-the-art literature. The comparative study demonstrates the validity and the potential of the proposed approach and shows its robustness to solve the optimal LFC problem. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In the present paper, the influence of accelerated thermal aging on thermally upgraded Kraft and Nomex 910 insulated power transformers has been determined. The present experimental study also determines the effectiveness of 2, 6-dibutyl-4-methylphenol oxidative inhibitor on the degradation rate of mineral transformer oil with alternative solid dielectrics. From the accelerated aging studies, it has been revealed that Nomex impregnated oil samples have shown around 15% improved thermal characteristics over thermally upgraded Kraft oil samples. Also these samples have exhibited 20% enhanced oxidation stability even at temperatures more than 200°C. Therefore, Nomex insulating materials have been recommended as solid dielectrics for power transformers in order to achieve better operating characteristics and improved oxidation stability. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Transmission network congestion is an important issue in deregulated power systems, whenever the physical or operational constraints in a transmission network become active, the system is said to be in a state of congestion. Congestion management (CM) is a mechanism to prioritize the transactions and commit to such a schedule that will not overload the network. This paper presents relieving transmission network congestion in two ways, one is without disturbing the existing transactions by optimal placement of thyristor controlled series capacitor (TCSC) and, another is rescheduling generators including optimal placement of distribution generation (DG) unit. Congestion in a transmission system can result in very high locational prices for electricity determined by marginal costs from optimal power flow (OPF) based CM problems. The problem is solved by particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) for fast convergence ratio and minimizes production cost; compare its results with each other for finding a good economical solution method among them. The considerable cost of TCSC and better performance of DG unit, it is necessary to find their optimal location, where sensitivity methods are suggested to determine the optimal placement of these devices. The proposed approach is tested on a standard IEEE 30 bus test system. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Electrical load is a major input factor in a country's economic development. To support economic growth and meet future demands for electricity, Load forecasting has become a very important task for electrical power management and planning. Several techniques have been employed to accomplish this task. One of those that is mostly used is Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) method, which have seen the largest number of studies in the field. the load time series data are auto-correlated and are influenced by other variables, such as temperature and population, etc. Furthermore, a large data sample is needed to perform mid-long term forecasts. For the latter purpose and in order to overcome both the lack of data and the high complexity of adding exogenous variables, a multi-model method, based on neural networks, is proposed for the mid-long term load consumption forecasting. The proposed model decomposes, the initial time series into three components using the X12-ARIMA algorithm, and performs a forecast for each component using three Nonlinear Auto Regressive (NAR) neural networks, with a Feed Forward neural network combining the outputs of the NARs. The experiments that were conducted showed that the proposed model provided good performance even when using a small sample of available data when compared to benchmark models. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This research has proposed a method to decompose complex factoid question into several independent questions. The method comprises four stages: (1) classifying input question into several categories such as sub-question, coordination, exemplification, or double question, (2) generating all possible question boundary candidates, (3) selecting the best question boundary, and (4) performing the question decomposition rule using the best question boundary. This study compared several machine learning algorithms in the first stage (complex factoid question classification) and third stage (question decomposition boundary selection). The features used in the classification are specific word lists with its related information including the syntactic features of POS (Part of Speech) tag. For the experiments, we annotated 916 sentences for training data and 226 sentences for testing data. The perplexity of the annotated corpus achieved 1.000586 with 307 Out of Vocabulary (OOV). The complex factoid question classification accuracy reached 93.8% with Random Forest algorithm. The question decomposition boundary selection accuracy achieved 93.80% for sub-question (using Random Forest algorithm), 86.11% for double question (using Random Forest algorithm), 88.23% for coordination (using SMO), and 60.87% for exemplification (using kNN, NB, and RF). A revision rule was provided for the question decomposition boundary selection that improved the accuracy into 97.22% for double question, 94.11% for coordination, and 65.21% for exemplification. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In the power system operation, the Load Frequency Control (LFC) is required for good quality reliable electric power supply. The main aim of the load frequency control is to maintain the frequency of each area and the tie-line power flow within the specified tolerance. This is achieved by adjusting the real power output of the generators for the corresponding changes in the load demand. Electric power industry is now an open market structure. This deregulated environment comprises of GENCOs, TRANSCOs and DISCOs, which are supervised by an Independent Service Operator (ISO). In this paper, the transaction between the GENCOs and DISCOs in the deregulated market structure based on the DISCO Participation Matrix (DPM) is designed and simulated. The Proportional-Integral (PI) controller is used to tune the LFC. In this tuning, an intelligent global Particle Swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used, which is a population based evolutionary algorithm. The dynamic response of the system is improved by minimizing the Integral Square Error (ISE). The response of the PSO tuned PI controller is compared with the response of the conventional PI controller for the system considered. It is found that, the response of the proposed PSO tuned PI controller is better than that of the conventional PI controller. The simulation is implemented in MATLAB-Simulink. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, grid disturbances like asymmetrical sag and swell faults in phase-A are analyzed for the grid connected DFIG. The dynamic behavior of DFIG is compared and tabulated with results using state error compensators like PI, PI with resonant (PIR) and internal model control (IMC) on rotor side converter (RSC). The RSC is designed analytically with enhanced field oriented control (EFOC) technique for better performance during such grid disturbances. In this technique, rotor flux reference changes from synchronous speed to some smaller speed or zero during the fault for injecting current at the rotor slip frequency. In this process, DC-Offset component of flux is controlled in not decomposing into a lower value of faults and maintaining it. This offset decomposition of flux will be oscillatory in conventional FOC, whereas in EFOC with internal model controller, flux can damp quickly not only for single fault but multiple faults. This strategy can regulate stator and rotor current waveform to sinusoidal without much distortion during and after fault. It has better damped torque oscillations, control in rotor speed and generator flux during and after fault. The fluctuations in DC bus voltage across capacitor are also controlled using proposed EFOC technique. The system performance with phase-A over voltage and under-voltage with above controllers and EFOC technique are analyzed using simulation studies. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Overcurrent relays (OCRs) play a vital role in operating the protection of power distribution system. In the presence of distributed generation (DG), OCR coordination is used to ensure reliability and speed of relay operation to avoid unintentional DG disconnection during fault conditions. Therefore, this paper presents an optimal OCR coordination in radial system under the presence of DG. An optimal OCR coordination can be obtained by selecting time dial setting (TDS) and plug setting (PS). A modified firefly algorithm (MFA) is proposed to finds the optimal OCR coordination. The proposed method is applied to four different case studies with DG. The proposed method is compared to both the firefly algorithm (FA) and conventional method. The results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the result of the FA and reduce all cases operating time of the OCR coordination, which reaches 38.38 %. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - We present in this paper a geometric interpretation of the 3D model reconstruction of the blood vessel of the human retina. The proposed method combines the approach of the vessel tracking algorithm with the use of a continuous model of generalized cylinder. The model is composed of two geometric objects: a generator axis H and a surface S, represented as a stack of contours plans attached to this axis. The segmentation algorithms by monitoring vessels that we propose is written by the use of three interpolation method for have a smooth generator axis H. First, the graph topology of the blood vessel is extracted from the human retina image. This is done after the skeletonisation of the image, then, the pixel classification (termination points and bifurcation points and inner points) and determination of the branches curve. Secondly, we use three methods of the approximation of the vessels for have a smooth curve (linear, cubic splines and least square linear interpolation). Afterwards, the construction of a 3D model from a vascular image is done by using the Right Generalized Cylinder State Model (RGC-sm). Finally, in a last part, we present results of segmentation and 3D reconstruction of a blood vessel group. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper proposes an efficient methodology for optimal location and sizing of static shunt capacitors in radial distribution systems to reduce real power loss, improve voltage profile and to maximize total cost saving. The solution methodology has two parts: In part one, the buses to be compensated is identified using loss sensitivity factors. In the second part, modified artificial bee colony algorithm is used to select the optimal size of capacitors to be placed at the candidate buses. In addition the number of candidate buses is selected by searching for maximum cost saving. The results of proposed approach have been presented and compared with previous methods reported in the literature using four test cases. The presented results indicate the efficiency and quality of solution. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work investigates Automatic Generation Control and optimal gain setting of conventional controller for multi area interconnected reheat thermal power systems. Conventional Proportional-integral-Derivative (PID) controller is used for this investigation. Optimization of controller gain values are tuned by Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE) traditional approach. The proposed work presents new Artificial Intelligence for tuning of controller gain values. The effectiveness and robustness of proposed technique is investigated with one percent step load perturbation in either area of the system with and without considering appropriate Generate Rate Constraint (GRC). Time domain analysis is used for the performance comparison and analysis for this work. Finally, simulation result reveals that new proposed AI based controller provide more superior response, when compared to conventional controller with and without considering the effect of non-linearity. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Cost is the main factor to run a project. Projects of renewable hybrid power plants that typically built in rural area have limited development funds. Thus, these plants should be based on an effectiveness and efficiency in order to meet the load demands with a certain reliability index. This work explains minimum cost by optimizing the cost of the power plants, Nett Present Cost or NPC, with an Equivalent Loss Factor (ELF) index to supply typical villages needs (200 kW), with the source of wind, solar, micro hydro and fuel cell. The result of this optimization includes batteries are used as an energy storage, which are considered as a source in the optimization process. The simulation by PSO method is proposed to solve the optimization problems. The simulation produces the equation function between Cost of Energy, LCOE and a reliability ELF index by y =-0.016ln (x) + 0.0131. The lower ELF index the higher LCOE value, according to the equation function. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Techniques able to assess distribution networks reliability have to be adapted to the Smart Grid paradigm that is going to be implemented in real scenarios in the next future. In this perspective, an algorithm for distribution systems reliability assessment in the presence of distributed generators, accounting for islanding operation too, is presented in this paper. The procedures of the algorithm are the core of an analytical method and random/sequential Monte Carlo simulation methods developed by the authors in previous works. These methods are based on two elements: the first one is a generalized systematic approach able to identify the fault effect on a network’s node thanks to some topological rules (called "cases") applicable to any radial network; the second one is a technique to faster compute reliability indices by aggregating faulted branches (called "set of branches") and nodes (called "set of nodes"). The paper proposes two automatic and general procedures to identify the cases and the sets, which are useful for implementation of both analytical and Monte Carlo simulation methods. © 2015 School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper presents an intelligent Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller for Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) system using Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). In the proposed method, the PID controller parameters are tuned off line by using combination of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to minimize the cost function over a wide range of operating condition. The optimal values of PID controller parameters obtained from SNR-PSO algorithm for each considered operating condition are used to train ANFIS. Therefore, the proposed techniques could online tune the PID controller parameters at any other operating condition to improve the transient response of the system. In order to evaluate the performance of the SNR-PSO PID controller, the results are compared with the Genetic Algorithm (GA). Also, the performance of proposed intelligent PID controller is compared with the robust SNR-PSO PID controller with fixed parameters. The comparison shows the SNR-PSO based ANFIS controller is more efficiency than robust PID controller. © 2015 School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper present solution of optimal power flow problem using a firefly algorithm (FA) with consideration of FACTS devices UPFC. The objective is to minimize the total fuel cost of generation and also maintain an acceptable system performance in terms of limits on generator real power and reactive power outputs, bus voltages and power flow of transmission lines. In order to maximize the relief of congestion in power system, to reduce the total system real power loss and improves the loadability of the system we propose also the optimization of the placement of FACTS devices in the power system (UPFC). The proposed method is tested on IEEE 30-bus system and the Algerian electrical network. The result of this method is compared with those obtained by biogeography based optimization (BBO), genetic algorithm (GA), and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics .All right reserved.

AB  - This paper aims to provide a view of a lively space charge accumulation in new polyvinyl chloride (PVC) nanocomposite thin films. Space charges in thin films of polyvinyl chloride nanocomposite insulation materials are done to distort the local electric fields and affect high-field conduction and breakdown phenomena, whatever, adding nanofillers to polyvinyl chloride changes their electrical ages. Thus, space charge characteristics have been investigated by pulsed electroacoustic (PEA) measurement system for thin thickness of polyvinyl chloride nanocomposite materials which filled with different separately nanoparticles like ZnO, TiO2, and Al2O3. This paper depicts that space charge accumulation in polyvinyl chloride nanocomposites differs with respect to type and concentration of nanoparticles. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics .All right reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we try to solve the Redundancy Optimization Problem (ROP) using a recent bio-inspired meta-heuristic that is Firefly Algorithm (FA) combined to Universal Moment Generating Function (UMGF).The problem consists on selecting the appropriate components from a multi-state system (MSS) given the minimum cost. The solution must also fulfill a system reliability constraint. The reliability in our work is considered as the ability to satisfy the demand and is calculated using u-tranform technique. Our algorithm was tested on a system contained multiple choices of five subsystems from a list of product available in the market. The components of each subsystem are characterized by their cost, performance (capacity) and availability. The results obtained by the proposed algorithm are compared with several algorithm founds in literature. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All right reserved.

AB  - Recent developments and advancements in the areas of permanent magnets, power electronics and modern control technologies have significantly influenced the wide-spread use of Brushless DC (BLDC) motor drives. BLDC motors are now, widely used in many applications such as servo drives, computer peripheral equipments and electric vehicles due to their high power density, high efficiency, compact size and easier control. In this paper a control scheme is presented which uses the traditional PID controller for the speed control of BLDC motor. PID controller is designed both by Zeigler-Nichols tuning method and Genetic Algorithm. A controller based on fractional order PID is also designed using Genetic algorithm and the performances of fractional PID controller are compared with the performance of PID controller. MATLAB/SIMULINK software is used to simulate and test the performances of the designed controllers. © 2014, International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes power-controlled multi carrier and multiuser detection techniques for Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems. In conventional CDMA systems, a RAKE receiver is employed to overcome wireless channel effect due to frequency selective characteristics of wireless CDMA systems. Alternatively, multi carrier technique can also be used to overcome the effect of frequency selective channel. Conventional CDMA systems also employ single-user detection scheemes, in that interference between users, called the multiple access interference (MAI), is considered as interference which contributes to the statistics of detection variables affecting the quality of detection. Now, multiuser detection method is proposed to mitigate the inter user interference in CDMA systems. In multiuser detections, the MAI component can be eliminated or cancelled by the use of all user’s spreading code in the system to be available to each user. Another technique that is commonly employed in CDMA system is power control, to mitigate the effects of near-far and fading channel fluctuations. In this study, the basic concept of multi carrier and multiuser detection technique is described in a simple model and the performance for various number of users is simulated and evaluated. The performance of power-controlled multi-carrier and multiuser detection technique is then evaluated and compared with that of the singleuser detection to show a significant improvement. © 2014, International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy is a general origin of sight-threatening complication to which the condition occurring in persons with diabetes and which makes progressive damage to the retina. Retina is a back of eye with the light sensitive lining. The severity of this Diabetic Retinopathy in retina has four stages. The identification of the severity level of Diabetic Retinopathy in retina is a critical task. In order to make ease this task, a severity analysis method is proposed in this paper. The proposed method contains the 5 stages – (1) Pre-processing phase (2) Segmentation Phase (3) Feature Extraction Phase (4) Classification Phase I and (5) Classification Phase II. The retinal images are subjected to pre-processing phase for removing the noises from the image and make clear visible image of retina. Then the optic disks and the blood vessels in the retina are segmented using Modified Region Growing method and morphological operations, respectively. Before analyzing the severity in retinal images, it is necessary to classify the images into normal and abnormal images using Neural Network classifier. For this classification of images, the features mean, variance, entropy and area are extracted from the segmented optic disk of retinal images and also the features mean, variance, entropy, area, diameter and number of regions are extracted from the segmented blood vessels of retinal images. From the abnormal images, the severity of Diabetic Retinopathy can be evaluated by using SVM classifier based on area and intensity level of Hard Exudates and Hemorrhages. These techniques are implemented on publicly available database such as STARE and on real datasets using MATLAB 7.12. The performance of our proposed method is analyzed by Sensitivity, Specificity and Accuracy. From the results, it is proved that our work outperforms other works by providing very much better accuracy by classifying the severity level in Diabetic Retinopathy. © 2014, International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In this study alinearized Heffron-Phillipsmodel of a single machine power system installed with a unified power flow controller (UPFC) has been presented. The selection of the output feedback parameters for the UPFC controllers is converted to an optimization problem which is solved by cuckoo optimization algorithm (COA).COA, as a new evolutionary optimization algorithm, is used in multiple applications. This optimization algorithm has a strong ability to find the most optimistic results for dynamic stability improvement. The effectiveness of the proposed controller for damping low frequency oscillations is tested and results compared with imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA).The controllers are tested to variations in system loading. There sulks analysis reveals that COA minimized cost function and improved dynamic stability, better than ICA. In addition, the potential and superiority of the proposed method over the ICA is demonstrated. The simulation results analysis shows that the designed COA based output feedback UPFC damping controller has an excellent capability in damping low frequency oscillations and enhance rapidly and greatly the dynamic stability of the power systems. © 2014, International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper focuses on studying the effect of the unified power flow controller (UPFC) and generalized unified power flow controller (GUPFC) to maximize the Available Transfer Capability (ATC). The normalized sensitivity factors technique is used, can be approximately computed, to determine the ATC of a test system, considering a variety of system limits. The basic Voltage Stability Constrain Optimal Power Flow (VSC-OPF) solution that does not consider contingencies is used for determining the sensitivity of power flows with respect to the critical loading parameter. Then, based on this solution and assuming a small variation of the loading parameter, compute the power flows again by solving critical power flows function. Then the sensitivity of system loading factor and N-1 contingency criteria technique is used to determine an optimal location of the UPFC and GUPFC controller. Finally, using proper models of the UPFC and GUPFC controllers, the effects of this Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) controller on the system ATC are studied. The IEEE 57- bus and 118-bus is used as the test system for validity, computing the system ATC for a given generation and loading pattern. All realistic control limits, as well as voltage dependent loads, are used in the ATC computation, with and without FACTS controller. The GUPFC can so strong influence the system in controlling or enhancement the ATC as good as power flow possible is compared with the UPFC.

AB  - This paper presents development of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression, driven by a Radial Basis Function kernel for obtaining the composition of boiler flue gas mixtures. The frequency components of various gas mixtures were first processed by Floyd K - Means algorithm and the data with class labels were utilized to build a multi-class SVM regression model for discrimination of the flue gas constituents and subsequent composition finding. The Meta parameters (C, ε and kernel) are optimized using grid search technique to obtain appropriate support vectors to train the network. After ascertaining the performance of proposed technique through volatile organic component (VOC) data acquired from quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) type sensors used by earlier researchers, detailed studies have been carried out to study the discriminating and estimation capability of the proposed technique for real time flue gas data acquired from two different analyzers namely ORSATR and KANE. Exhaustive studies clearly indicate the exceptional performance of the proposed SVM model in classifying and estimating the flue gas components in machine (Analyzer) independent manner.

AB  - During the past years, governments throughout the world have been encouraging the installation of renewable energy systems to cope with environmental goals. In this framework, there has been a significant increase in the number of energy producers on the consumers'side, majorly due to photovoltaic and wind energy microgeneration. This has brought some concerns in voltage control on buses far away from the substation. The present paperanalyses the impact of these microgeneration systems on the low voltage grid, namely in what concerns overvoltage issues. For this purpose, both stochastic models to predict solar irradiance and wind speed and a threephase power flow algorithm to compute voltages on the buses of a test network are used. The probabilistic power flow study, carried on using Monte Carlo methods, reveals the possibility of overvoltage problems. A solution based on batteries attached to the micro generators is proposed to cope with this issue. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the solution, as a way to decrease over voltages, while preserving the producers' revenues.

AB  - In India, presently distribution companies are collecting revenues from their consumers by metering and billing. The expenses for metering, billing, and collecting dues became complex as electricity is supplied to large number of consumers located in far-flung areas, resulted in high cost per unit. This may encourage consumers to fudge meter readings. To address these problems, distribution companies can opt prepaid smart card energy meter, which overcomes the whole problems associated with the present billing system and will make the consumer more conscious about usage electricity. This paper explores the design and assemble of smart card prepaid electricity meter system, which enables the consumer to buy required amount of energy and also provides information about their credit balance. A prototype of the system has been developed with the state-of-the-art digital and information technology and proven to be stable, reliable, tamper resistant, low cost, and easy maintenance.

AB  - In this research study, the performance of direct torque and flux control (DTFC) induction motor drive (IMD) is presented using four different speed control techniques. The performance of IMD mainly depends on the design of speed controller. The PI speed controller (PISC) requires precise mathematical model, continuous and appropriate gain values. Therefore, adaptive control based speed controller is desirable to achieve high performance drive. The sliding-mode speed controller (SMSC) is developed to achieve continuous control of motor speed and torque. Furthermore, the fuzzy logic speed controller (FLSC) and fuzzy sliding-mode speed controller (FSMSC) is designed to obtain high performance, dynamic tracking behavior, speed accuracy and also robustness to parameter variations. The performance of each control technique has been tested for its robustness to parameter uncertainties and load disturbances. The detailed comparison of different control schemes are carried out in a MATALB/Simulink environment at different speed operating conditions, such as, forward and reversal motoring under no-load, load and sudden change in speed.

AB  - This paper presents voltage stability analysis of radial distribution networks in the presence of distributed generation. The analysis is accomplished using a voltage stability index which can be evaluated at each node of the distribution system. The location of DG has the main effect voltage stability on the system. Artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) is proposed to determine the optimal DG-unit size and location by loss sensitivity index (LSI) in order to improve the voltage stability in radial distribution system. Constant power, constant current, constant impedance and composite load modelling are considered for the purpose of voltage stability analysis.

AB  - The proper mixing of nanoscale fillers in conventional dielectric materials leads to an enhancement in the breakdown strength and voltage endurance. In this study experimental investigations are carried out to compare the breakdown characteristics of epoxy nano-composites with that of a base epoxy resin under the influence of divergent electric fields so as to obtain inferences on its breakdown performances. This would in turn enable providing solutions to acquire more effective electrical insulation systems and explore the prospect of tapping the merits of utilizing the rapid strides made in field of fabrication of nano-dielectrics. The main objective is such studies are to enhance the electrical properties of the epoxy dielectric by employing nano-fillers such as SiO2, TiO2 etc. This research envisages the use of epoxy resin mixed with nano-fillers for ascertaining the ability of the nano-composite to be utilized as a dielectric/ insulator in power apparatus. The epoxy resin is mixed with appropriate proportion of SiO2 and TiO2 and experimentation is carried out under the influence of divergent electric fields. Classical breakdown voltage withstand tests such as AC power frequency, DC voltage, lightning impulse and switching impulse test is carried out on epoxy dielectrics (with and without nano-fillers) and the results are compared. In addition, a non-classical breakdown voltage test (high frequency high voltage) is also devised to analyze and ascertain the breakdown characteristics due to varying frequencies so as to investigate the possibility of utilizing such nano-composites in applications related to high speed switching devices.

AB  - The Ka-band channel model ofHigh Altitude Platform (HAP) for high speed train is modeled as a flat and time varying Rician process with 10-25 dB Rician factor. In order to compensate for the time varying fading channel and considering the fact that the Line-of-Sight (LOS) component is dominant, adaptive beamforming with the least-squares (LS) approach is employed at the receiver. Theoretical analysis of the LS algorithm is performed for very large Rician factor in the high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) regime. In particular, the analysis is with respect to the estimated autocorrelation matrix of the received vector and the beamforming weight. It is shown that, the estimated autocorrelation matrix of the received vector resembles the autocorrelation matrix of the array steering response. The presented analysis are then verified by Monte Carlo simulations.

AB  - This paper describes a very detailed and comprehensive description of a model predictive controller (MPC) applied to the buck converter working in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) to optimize the performance of the converter. The converter is designed for a fixed switching frequency of 1 MHz. The proposed model predictive control technique achieves improved set point tracking with minimal overshoot, offers consistent closed loop performance and has short settling time. Although MPC rejects unmeasured disturbances effectively, but it shows poor load and line regulation. Solution has been suggested in order to robustify the load and line regulation. Further neural network based MPC has also been designed. The impact of the MPC parameters such as prediction and control horizons, performance weights, and constraints on the performance is minutely observed. In order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, MPC is compared with the classical well-known PWM-PID controller. MATLAB/Simulink simulation results validate the control design procedure.

AB  - This paper presents an experimental study on repetitive partial discharge inception probability of twisted enameled wires subjected to modified inverter-surges. In order to obtain the probability curves as a function of the voltage amplitude, we develop an automatic measurement system of partial discharge inception probability for the twisted enameled wires subjected to the repetitive pulses with step-by-step increasing in the voltage height. Very fast oscillated pulses with or without polarity-reversal and an impulse-like pulse without oscillation are used as the modified inverter-surges. In the test for the impulse-like voltage, repetitive partial discharge inception voltage (RPDIV) decreases with increasing the pulse width. On the other hand, RPDIV for the polarity-reversed pulse with a higher oscillation cycle is lower than that for the pulse with lower oscillation cycle. The difference of PD inception probability between the voltage waveforms will be discussed on the basis of charge dynamics on the wire surfaces.

AB  - There is a need for an action plan for achieving photovoltaic power generation capacity in Nigeria. The total irradiation of 5.5kW-hr/day/ m2 (ECN-UNDP, 2005) of solar radiation in Nigeria is not utilized for PV generation. The integration of Solar PV grid technology into the Nigerian grid systems will provide an attractive environmentally sound technology options for the Nigerian Electricity industry, it could offset a significant proportion of the foreign exchange that is used annually for importing Power generators, and its associated accessories such as diesels, oil, spare parts, etc. In addition PV grid integration is well suited for meeting the recent directive by the federal government of Nigerian for Local government Sectors to generate its own electricity The 5.5kW-hr/day/m2 represents a huge prospect for solar energy generation if a total capacity can be developed for PV grid integration. This paper proposes using experimental models and control strategies, a large scale introduction of solar power (PV) into the Nigerian distribution grid. Counter measures for harmonics will be developed and demonstrated. The output from the PV systems and its associate problems such as Pulsating AC signal will be analyzed and demonstrated. We will evaluate the impact of a of PV penetration on the optimum economical design by using general purpose components for main circuits, switching elements and switches and selection of operating capacity that takes maximum advantage of the capacity of each element and solar irradiation capacity. The assessment of the best practice for program design and implementation will be observed.

AB  - Models in high frequency range for underground power cable connections are essential for the interpretation of partial discharge (PD) signals arising e.g. diagnostic techniques. This paper focuses on modeling of power cable joints. A lumped parameter odel and a cascaded transmission line model are proposed based on scattering parameters (S -parameters) measurement on a 10 kV oil-filled PILC-PILC straight cable joint in the frequency range of 300 kHz-800 MHz. It is shown that the lumped model is suitable for up to 10 MHz while the transmission line model can cover the whole frequency range. The cascaded transmission line model is applied to simulate the reflection on a 150 kV single core XLPE straight joint. Comparison between measurement and simulation indicates that the model parameters (characteristic impedance and propagation coefficient) can be matched to predict the joint's propagation characteristics.

AB  - This paper presents a performance comparison between three optimization techniques, namely, quantum-inspired binary particle swarm optimization, binary particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm in application to optimal power quality monitor (PQM) placement method for voltage sag assessment. The optimization handles the observability constraints based on the topological monitor reach area concept and solves a multi-objective function in obtaining the optimal number and placement of PQMs in power systems. The objective function consists of two functions which are based on monitor overlapping index and sag severity index. All the optimization algorithms have been implemented and tested on the IEEE 34-node, the 69-bus and the IEEE 118-bus test systems to evaluate the effectiveness of the aforementioned techniques. The results show that QBPSO provide a better optimal solution than the standard binary particle swarm optimization and the existing genetic algorithm by 56% and 31%, respectively. The validation test illustrated that the optimal PQM placements can detect and record the voltage sag events due to any fault occurrence in the systems.

AB  - The delta primary - transposed zigzag secondary (DTz) transformer has been designed and used to reduce the bad impacts of the harmonic in the distribution power system. The DTz transformer is constructed with delta connection in primary winding and the three transposed windings at the different core legs of secondary winding. The harmonic reduction method of the DTz transformer applies two basic principles. The first principle is to inhibit electromagnetic energy of the harmonic currents by cancelling the phase polarity on the secondary winding. The second is to insulate the remaining of the mmf induction from harmonic current loads and minimize to circulate in the delta windings on the primary side. The triplen harmonics currents generated on the primary and secondary winding of DTz transformer are simulated in this paper. Both balanced and unbalanced loads of the three-phase distribution system are examined. The experiment shows that the total THD current in the secondary winding when balanced loads are applied is about 70.8 %, and in the primary side is 24.3 %. While for unbalanced loads, the average THD in secondary winding is 68.44 % and in delta winding is 26.4 %. It means the DTz transformer has a filter-ability to reduce about 42 - 46 % THD for both balanced and unbalanced loads. By comparing the computer simulation results and data measurements through experiment in the laboratory, it is proved that the use of the proposed DTz transformer is one of the methods to reduce harmonic currents and inhibit them to enter to the supply system.

AB  - This paper presents the advancement in power system engineering education and research with power industry moving towards deregulation. Deregulation is a relatively recent concept, whose economic, regulatory and implementation structure continues to be adopted to the specific needs of each nation. For example, price based unit commitment in the present scenario is totally different compared to a regulated set up. Hence adequate exposes towards power engineering curriculum and new software tools are needed to support new activities in the modern power pools. This methodology performed in this will be a great challenges for the power industry and thus an individual human can take their own decision of choosing the reliable continuous supply of power from the electricity markets at an affordable price. Under this restructured system, generation companies (GENCOs) schedule their generators with the objective of maximizing their profit. The profit based unit commitment (PBUC) is performed by considering both the power and reserve generations. The quoting of power and reserve prices in spot markets and reserve markets are the important decision process. This proposed algorithm is tested for a small unit test system with 3 unit 12 hour data and the simulations are carried out to show the performance of proposed methodology using MATLAB.

AB  - In this paper, a conventional thermal power plant with single stage reheat turbine is taken into consideration. It is equipped with AVR, IEEE type dual input PSS3B and integral controlled AGC loop. A hybrid distributed generation (DG) system consisting of wind turbine generators, aqua electrolyzer, fuel cells, diesel engine generator, flywheel energy storage system and battery energy storage system is configured. This hybrid DG system is integrated with the grid connected thermal unit. The different tunable parameters of this integrated power system are optimized by a novel craziness-based PSO with wavelet mutation (CRPSOWM), developed by the authors. While integrating the DG with the thermal power system, improved transient performance is noticed. Further improvement in the transient performance is observed with the usage of capacitive energy storage unit in the AGC loop of conventional power generation scheme. The proposed CRPSOWM incorporates a wavelettheory-based mutation operation and offers robust and promising results.

AB  - EOG is a biosignal generated by eye activities. This research develops the use of EOG signals in a new way. EOG was used to control a robot manipulator that reaches for a target in 3-D area. Five properties of EOG signal were used, which were: threshold, polarity of signal, integral of absolute EOG signals, peak and period of a wave. The use of these properties allowed the apparatus to detect the EOG signals, estimate gaze distance and distinguish between gaze motion, voluntary blinks and involuntary blinks. Targets were recorded by two cameras that provided front and top views. The images were viewed on a monitor one at a time with the active camera selected by voluntary blinking. EOG signals were converted to pixel coordinates using an affine transform. The pixel coordinates were then transformed into robot coordinates using the correlation between camera position, robot position and monitor display. Robot coordinates of a target became end-effector position and joint angles were derived through inverse kinematics. The result shows that this system could reach target with approximately 90% accuracy. This system successfully improved the flexibility of controlling a robot in three dimensions. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper proposes machine-to-machine device connectivity (M2M-DC) framework to enhance efficiency of smart metering system by controlling electrical devices in a building. Internet of Things (IoT) is a trend technology implemented in many areas, of which the utilization to enhance the efficiency of power consumption is significantly important. There are several smart metering solutions have been developed in recent years, however, they are silo solutions that pay a little attention to scalability. To ensure scalability, a framework that rules number of sensors, actuator and devices are required. M2M-DC is a proposed framework that connects the nodes with sensors and actuators to the backend system based on the rule set. Some experiments are performed to measure the effectiveness of the system. The results show that the M2M-DC framework can control energy consumption, achieving higher energy efficiency of 26.35%, regarding the rule set. Based on the Wilcoxon method, the significance of the increase of efficiency on power consumption is confirmed. The scalability of proposed framework is also verified by varying sensors, actuators and devices. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper aims to provide a high performance sensorless control based on an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) applied to fault-tolerant PMSM drive system with statorresistance estimation. It proposes a fast method of fault switches detection in the power converters. The considered drive is composed of three phases PMSM and a four leg three phase’s inverter when the fourth is the redundant leg. After a short-switch fault occurrence, the redundant leg replaces the faulty leg. The simulation results verify that the proposed control method and the fault tolerant inverter ensure the high reliability and continuously operation of the sensorless vector control PMSM system under inverter fault. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce a new technique to recognize face image based on the gradation contour of face color. The problems remain in face recognition issue is about lighting, expressions and poses. Feature based method is considered highly successful and quite economical, however this approach is very sensitive to the light, viewing angles and poses. To handle this problem, it is better to represent the face using the 3D models, although the cost is too expensive. Related to lighting, naturally people tend to recognize the face shape based on it. According to that, the authors tried a face recognition approach using contour gradation on the face color. Variables tested in this study was Threshold Contour error, X error and Size error, then those variables are tested against the image with light illumination, yaw face and variation amount of contour lines. After testing, the best recognition results generated by 85.458% for Aberdeen face database with 150 contour lines and 90% for Yale face database. The other result showed that image with different expression was still recognizable however it cannot be recognized more than 20 degrees yaw faces. It indicated that the face contour as a feature was fairly representative to be used in face recognition. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Catastrophic circumstances and equipment failures continue to occur due to Ferroresonance even though this phenomenon has been extensively investigated since, many years ago. This study enhances mitigation of Ferroresonance by means of Flexible AC Transmission System. Static var compensator is used to suppress Ferroresonance along with controlling voltage and reactive power in the network. Manitoba Hydro 230 kV electrical network has experienced Ferroresonant states several times. In this paper, by means of PSCAD/EMTDC simulation software, Ferroresonant states are recognized and analyzed in Manitoba Hydro network. Ferroresonant states are classified in adequate modes by Ferroresonance detection tools. Power and control circuit of SVC is designed and Ferroresonant states are examined in presence of SVC. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - This Paper presents a framework to carry out a simulation for closed loop speed control of BLDC motor with PID and Modified PID controller. The novelty of this paper lies in the design of modified PID controller to track the reference trajectory with and without load in addition to minimizing the initial overshoot. The simulation includes all realistic values and components of the motor. The three phase inverter and its control algorithm is modeled and simulated using MATLAB Simulink. The PID and Modified PID controller track the reference speed with and without load disturbances in closed loop control but the demerit of conventional PID can be observed in its steep overshoot in the closed loop transient response. The speed, torque, dc-link current and back-emf waveforms are analyzed for various load torque conditions through MATLAB Simulink. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The PWM rectifiers are become one of the most used solutions to improve the quality of the electrical energy transfer from a source to a receiver. Indeed, this paper proposes a comparative study of a direct power control (DPC) of three-phase PWM rectifier using backstepping with integral action and Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers for the dc-bus voltage regulation. The evaluation of the robustness and the dynamic performance of these two control techniques have been verified by simulation using Matlab/Simulink environment, under different conditions, such as the variation of the reference voltage and the load. The simulation results show that the direct power control based on backstepping with integral action is more robust than the conventional PI controller and it possesses a good tracking of the reference values and also a more reduced total harmonic distortion (THD). © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The use of power electronic converters influences the generation of harmonics and reactive power flow in power system. Therefore, three-phase multilevel improved power quality AC-DC converters are gaining lot of popularity in power conversion applications. This work deals with critical problem of multilevel structure i.e neutral point potential (NPP) variation. In this paper, a simplified current controlled scheme is presented to ensure unity power factor operation. Neutral point potential (NPP) of three-phase, 3-level NPC AC-DC converter is controlled by modifying control signal in the controller using NPP regulator. An auxiliary circuit is being presented in this paper as an alternative option for controlling the neutral point potential of the converter. Comparison has been carried out between these control techniques in terms of power quality. A complete mathematical model is presented for better understanding of both techniques used for NPP control. The presented control techniques has been verified through simulation investigations and validated experimentally on the developed laboratory prototype. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The Sunbelt area like Algeria, specially the Saharan medium by its arid nature and the availability of huge solar irradiance can be a good choice of the application of the photovoltaic (PV) system. Water pumping by PV system for irrigation purposes can be considered as one of the basic needs in the rural areas of Algeria. PV modules are given a power rating at standard test conditions (STC) of 1000W/m2, AM1.5 and a module temperature 25°C, but these conditions do not represent what is typically experienced under outdoor operation. To improve the performances of such type of systems, a study based on outdoor experimental tests is necessary, to establish how much energy is produced and the major parameters that most influence on their quality. The main objective of this paper is to review the state of the art of PV systems in the Adrar Desert of Algeria by the analysis of the operational data of the PV installation. Sophisticated Verification method so called SV method has been used to evaluate a PV pumping system performance during seven months. Differences between real and installed energy of up to 18% have been detected. It has been observed that the high output gain due to the operating condition in an extreme low module temperature. On the basis of these monitoring results, the performance of PV systems is compared to the measured performance of residential PV systems installed in other countries. The results indicated that the motor-pump efficiency changed by the pumping head. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - This research proposed a new approach to recognize face image under various lighting expression. The Proposed method is started by generating of the Left Diagonal Matrix (LDM) and the Right Diagonal Matrix (RDM). Subsequently, the dimensionality reduction is conducted by using Two-Dimensional Eigenface of the LDM and the RDM. The results of dimensionality reduction are selected the maximum value based on the corresponding features. Finally, the geometric similarity measurement model is carried out to obtain the recognition rate. The proposed method was evaluated using three different facial image databases, which are the YALE, the ORL and the UoB face image databases. Two until six column features were used to measure the similarity between the training and the testing sets. Experimental results revealed that the proposed method produced 92.2%, 94%, and 94.7% recognition rate for the YALE, the ORL, and the UoB face image databases respectively. The proposed method was also compared to the other methods. On the ORL face image database, the comparison results show that the proposed method outperformed to the Eigenface, the Fisherface, and the Laplacianfaces but not for O-Laplacianfaces and Two-Dimensional Principal Component Analysis method. On the YALE and the UoB face image databases, the proposed method outperformed to the other appearance methods which are the Eigenface, the Fisherface, the Laplacianfaces, the O-Laplacianfaces and Two-Dimensional Principal Component Analysis methods. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - We proposed a cost estimation application in determining the feasibility of Li-Ion Battery manufacturing planning. The application is development of previous research about cost estimation model and technical feasibility study in Li-Ion battery manufacturing in mini plant scale. Cost estimation model is constructed in activity-based costing (ABC) model, while the technical feasibility process is constructed in Goldsmith Technology Commercialization Model. The application uses production planning data in ABC model for technical feasibility, market study data for market feasibility and management planning data for business feasibility. Management team can adjust the planning if the application shows that the planning is infeasible. By this application, management team can assess the feasibility of Li-Ion battery manufacturing planning in simple way considering the fluctuation of parameters. Numerical example has been simulated and shows the result in simple and fast way. The result can be consideration for Li-Ion battery management team in producing and business planning. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper deals with power control of a grid connected variable speed wind turbine system, based on doubly fed induction generator. In this paper we propose a novel control scheme of the rotor side converter, that is based on indirect control of power consist currents and powers control loops. The two loops of rotor currents: direct and quadrature component are controlled by the technique of the second order sliding mode using the super-twisting algorithm in order to eliminate the chattering phenomenon. A fuzzy logic controller is applied to the active and to the reactive powers loops exchanged between the stator of the doubly fed induction generator and the grid to track the maximum power point. In order to maintain the voltage of the DC-link constant of the grid side converter, the classical proportional integral controller is used. The proposed control strategy, which combines the second order sliding mode and fuzzy logic, is applied to a 1.5 MW three blade wind turbine shows robustness for variations in the wind speed. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Information hiding of data in an audio file is an important thing that the media can be recognized by its ownership. The hidden information would be the important information which describes the copyright of the audio file. In this research, the binary data is inserted or hidden into the audio file by multicarrier modulation technique data hiding. The encoded binary data is modulated by multicarrier frequencies before embedding into the host audio. Data hiding capacity with this technique can achieve up to 40 bits per second in file mode with good audio imperceptibility. It also achieves perfect robustness for type of attack noise addition, linear speed change, multi band equalization, and echo addition. And this technique is still acceptable for type of attack, such as resampling attack, MP3 compression attack and filtering attack for cut off frequency more than 10 kHz regarding to the BER less than 10%. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper presents a chaotic artificial bee colony (CABC) algorithm for optimal placement and sizing of DGs on distribution systems with an aim of reducing the power losses and improving voltage stability. The exploitation ability of solutions to the food searching process is improved in the CABC algorithm to avoid the premature convergence of an artificial bee colony algorithm. The proposed approach determines the control variable settings such as placement and size of DG for minimization of real power loss with impact of voltage stability in the distribution system. Further, the impacts of DG on the distribution system are studied with an importance on power losses and capacity savings. The proposed approach is examined and tested on 33 bus and 69 bus radial test systems. The simulation results of the proposed approach are compared to earlier reported approaches. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents, low power signed and unsigned fixed-width multipliers using the column bypassing technique with carry save adder array structure. We have decomposed the partial products into two parts and executed them in parallel to reduce the delay of proposed fixed-width array multiplier. The proposed multiplier reduces the power consumption by skipping the unwanted switching activity when the multiplicand operand consists of a number of zeros. This work evaluates the power, delay and area of fixed-width multipliers and shows that the proposed array multiplier consumes less power and has reduced delay compared to the conventional fixed-width array multipliers. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The new formulation of resonant frequency for absorber based on artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) structure composed of square patch array is investigated theoretically based on analytical approach. The investigation is performed to define the resonant frequency using equivalent LC circuit model from the physical dimension and material property of square patch array. The proposed equivalent LC circuit model formulas are derived using the conformal mapping theory for the adjacent co-planar square patches and the Gauss’ law and Faraday’s law for the square patch parallel with the ground plane. The analytical approach is then examined and compared with the numerical results of AMC structure simulated by use of commercialized software. Here, the AMC structure consists of a two-dimensionally (2D) array square patches deployed on a dielectric substrate. The frequency range of analysis which is observed from 1-5 GHz corresponds to the working frequency of square patch. Hence, the analyzed parameters of square patch, i.e. unit cell, include substrate width, substrate thickness, substrate properties, patch width, and the gap between patches. It shows that the proposed formulation of equivalent LC circuit model yields better results compared to the existing formulation. Moreover, the proposed formulation shows the bandpass-like structure in which the waves are absorbed in a certain value of frequency band. This is appropriate to the absorbance concept where some absorber will restrain the energy from incoming waves. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

The triple stages cascoded LNA was designed using the inductive drain feedback, inductive generation to the source, and the T-network at the input and output terminal as a matching technique. This LNA produced a gain (S<inf>21</inf>) of 79.16 dB and the noise figure (NF) of 0.71 dB. The output reflection (S<inf>22</inf>), input reflection (S<inf>11</inf>) and return loss (S<inf>12</inf>) are -12.56, -11.96 dB and -100.22 dB respectively. The measured 3dB bandwidth of 1.76 GHz has been achieved. The input sensitivity is - 92 dBm exceeded the standards required by the IEEE 802.16. The amplifier it is implemented using superHEMT FHX76LP transistor devices. The designed circuit is simulated with Ansoft Designer SV. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Low power design has become popular nowadays because ofdevelopment of improveddata converters with high resolution in CMOS process. Electronic device manufacturersare competing each other to produce devices that can extend battery life, have inexpensive packaging and cooling systems as well as reduce the size.The objective of this paper is to review various low power designs in digital to analog converters (DAC). The methods used to reduce the power consumption are presented in details. We focused the designs in the segmentation current steering DACs, as most of the low power designs illustarted in literatures are based on this architecture. From this review, we find that triple segmented architectureand spike free switching can reduce the power consumption effectively. This review paper can be a reference for the researchers and engineers to develop low power CMOS DACsfor various applications. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Wind power is the safest, cleanest resource and has emerged as the speediest growing renewable energy in terms of annual installed capacity. Before a wind-drive system is set up, thorough wind resource assessment (WRA) must be conducted. In this paper, a methodology based on ground-station and topographical neural network modeled data is proposed to study the wind energy potential, in the monitored location and areas not covered by directly measurement instrumentation at Kuching. A new topographical feed forward neural network (T-FFNN) back propagation trained with Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), which consists of three layers was used to model the wind speed profile. The daily 10 m height, average hourly measured wind speed data for a period of ten years (2003-2012) for eight stations operated by Malaysia Meteorological Department (MMD) were used for the training, testing and validation. The geographical, meteorological and synthesized topographical parameters were used as input data, whereas the monthly wind speeds as the objective function. The optimum topology with maximum mean absolute percentage error of 6.4 % and correlation value of 0.9946 between the reference measured and predicted was obtained. The predicted monthly wind speed varied from 1.3-1.98 m/s with an average annual wind speed of 1.62 m/s. The characteristics of ground -based station was analyzed and presented. It was found in all the areas examined that the wind power falls within a low power density class (PD ≤ 100w/m2). Results from the micro-sizing showed an annual energy output (AEO) in the range of 4-12 MWh/year. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a control method which combines sliding mode approach of direct power control and operates with constant switching frequency. This novel scheme Sliding Mode Constant Switching Frequency Direct Power Control (SM-CSF-DPC) employs a nonlinear sliding mode control (SMC) approach to directly calculate the required converter’s control voltage. The constant switching frequency (CSF) is achieved by using space vector modulation (SVM). In this novel scheme, the extra current control loops are eliminated, which simplifies the system design and enhances the transient performance. The improved strategy is tested on a simulation model of a two level VSC and compared with the conventional switching table direct power control (ST-DPC) strategy. The proposed SM-CSF-DPC methods have very good results both in steady-state and transients. It is shown that the proposed DPC exhibits several features, such as a simple algorithm, constant switching frequency, robust to power step change, step change of referenced DC voltage and is capable of providing enhanced transient performance in case of line voltage sags. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics .All right reserved.

AB  - Due to the rapid growth of load demand, different power sources are added to the power system, and the interconnection among various power devices for a modern electric grid also becomes more and more complicated. Therefore, the fault current is dramatically increasing, and Superconducting Fault Current Limiter (SFCL) has introduced to solve the related problems. In this paper proposes the strategies of applying SFCL to distribution feeder for the system performance improvement of power quality, including the fault current limiter and the mitigations of voltage variations including sag and swell. And the effectiveness for different feeder types, radial and closed-loop structures, is analyzed for Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) system. When a single-phase to ground fault happens to a certain point along the feeder or at the tie breaker, the simulation results show that SFCL can effectively limit the fault current, and the decrease in amplitude can be up to approximately 55%. Besides, the research results illustrate that the voltage sag severity at fault phase and voltage swell at non-fault phase are dependent of fault location. Therefore, the effectiveness of voltage quality improvement is definitely illustrated by the curve of Information of Technology Industry Council (ITI Curve). © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics .All right reserved.

AB  - Ever incrasing demand on power system needs latest FACTS devices to increase the power transfer capability. One of such device is Generalized Unified Power Flow Controller. This device has got more emphasis, as it has five/more degree of freedom, it can simultaneously control the voltage at the sending end and the power flow through the transmission lines to which the device is connected. The detailed Power Injection Model (PIM) of GUPFC is proposed in this paper. Location and rating of the device plays a major role, to get proper control in power system. An optimal placement strategy based on single line contingencies through performance index is proposed. Without loss of generality, device rating is calculated based on the power handling capacity of the converters. Series and Shunt Converter switching losses and the shunt converter reactive power injection are considered, to analyze the effect of the device. Analytical results confirms the effect of the device control parameters on a given test system. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics .All right reserved.

AB  - In this paper, critical conditions in electric power systems are monitored by applying various neural networks. In order to accomplish the stated goal, the authors tried several combinations of Feed Forward Neural Network and Layer Recurrent Neural Networks by imparting appropriate training schemes through supervised learning in order to formulate a comparative analysis on their performance. Once, training goes successful, the neural network learns how to deal with a set of newly presented data through validation and testing mechanism so as to evolve the best network structure and learning criteria. The proposed methodology has been tested on the standard IEEE 30-bus test system with the support of MATLAB based neural network toolbox. The results presented in this paper signify that the multi-layered feed forward neural network with Levenberg-Marquardt back propagation algorithm gives best training performance of all possible cases considered in this paper, thus validating the proposed methodology. © 2014, International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The article focuses on the issues of Load Frequency Control (LFC) under non-linear strategies in multi source multi area hydro thermal system. On practical perspective dead band, boiler dynamics, reheat steam turbine along with hydro turbine operating under two different area capacities are considered in the system. When subjected to random load variations in both the areas, the system exhibits higher oscillations. The speed governor matches the generation with the demand. The offset in the area frequencies and tie-line power is removed by using secondary Proportional Integral (PI) controller. The PI controller is tuned using Ziegler Nichols’ (ZN) and Fuzzy Gain Scheduling (FGS) method. The influence of high Proportional (P) controller gain during steady state and high Integral (I) controller gain during transient affects the system performance. Variable Structure System (VSS) helps to switch from P to PI controller during transient to steady state based on control error. The concept of VSS is applied to Fuzzy Gain Scheduling (FGS) PI controller. The performance of the optimal Variable Structure Fuzzy Gain Scheduled (VSFGS) controller under non-linear environment is judged and validated using performance indices. © 2014, International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Forecasting the annual long-term consumption of electrical energy in a country has remained for the Electrical Engineer quite a difficult problem to solve. As an important planning tool, the forecast of electrical energy consumption has to be as precise as possible. The most commonly employed method is that of scenario building. With the scenario method, consumption forecasting is done through the simulation of a sequence of events. The generated data cannot therefore be as stochastic as it is in reality. With the advent of the computer age, numerous other statistical methods for consumption forecasting have been developed. Prominent among them is the forecasting by machine learning with multiple-Input multiple-Output local learning strategy. The objective here is to obtain a forecast which is as precise as possible, while conserving the stochastic nature between the historical and the forecasted data. This article first presents the different strategies for long-term power consumption forecasting using Multiple-Input Multiple-Output local learning strategies. It then proposes, based on the work of earlier researchers, an approach that uses the weighted averages to improve on the level of precision obtained. Furthermore, it applies this new improved calculation method to forecast the power consumption specifically in Cameroon for horizon 2035, when the country aspires to become an emerging economy. The last part of this article utilizes historical data on the electricity consumption of some countries from the World Bank dataset to do a comparative study between the here newly proposed method and that used previously. The results show that, the new method using MISMO plus weighted average delivers more exact results for long-term electrical power consumption forecasts.

AB  - In this paper, a comparison on Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) by using different pulse width modulation schemes for an industrial drive application is performed. The induction motor drive system driven by a wind energy conversion system is modeled using a Self-Excited Induction Generator. To obtain a constant frequency output an Impedance Source Inverter (ZSI) is connected between the source and the load. The ZSI is selected to avoid the shoot-through limitation which is observed in other conventional PWM inverters. The PWM switching techniques like Trapezoidal PWM, Sinusoidal PWM and Space Vector PWM techniques are mathematically modeled operating at a switching frequency of 10 kHz to control the induction motor drive system though pulse generation. The proposed method is simulated using MATLAB program and the current harmonic levels for driving the IM drive are analyzed. The comparative analysis of current harmonics illustrates the efficient implementation of PWM technique for the drive applications. Based on the simulation evaluation a similar hardware prototype model is setup for a 900W system using Space Vector PWM technique and the results are compared.

AB  - Insulating barriers utilized in complex high voltage insulation systems has been exploited widely by manufacturers of power apparatus. Barriers have found utility in a variety of power apparatus for protection against direct lightning strokes, as an interface at the boundaries of composite insulation materials etc. Though investigations have been carried out by researchers on the breakdown characteristics, barrier position in the gap, influence of space charge etc these characteristics have been analyzed based on aspects pertinent to classical testing procedures only. Advent of high speed switching devices in power systems provides avenues to investigate the effect of insulation performance due to High Frequency High Voltage (HFHV) also. Further, uncharacteristic failures in oil filled distribution transformers have been reported indicated fast transients as the major cause for failures which was not revealed during classical laboratory testing. This research focuses on the influence and effects of solid insulating barriers placed in transformer oil due to HFHV in inhomogeneous fields. Test cell arrangement has been fabricated for carrying out experimental investigations to adhere international standards. Exhaustive experimentation has been performed to infer the influence of the position of barrier, nature of field and breakdown voltage, erosion characteristics of the barrier at an appropriate range of frequencies. A detailed comparison between HFHV and classical power frequency voltage has been carried out. The nature of ionization at the barrier interface and the subsequent increase in the breakdown voltage as explained by Double Electric Layer (DEL) theory has been cross validated. In addition, a study has also been carried out to assess and characterize the ageing of oil based on Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) analysis using Weibull distribution.

AB  - Many events, such as terrorist attacks, exposed serious weaknesses in most sophisticated security systems. So it is necessary to improve security data systems based on the body or behavioral characteristics, called biometrics. With the growing interest in the development of human and computer interface and biometric identification, human face recognition has become an active research area. Face recognition offers several advantages over other biometric methods. Nowadays Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been widely adopted for the face recognition algorithm. Yet still, PCA has limitations such as poor discriminatory power and large computational load. This paper proposed a novel algorithm for face recognition in which a low frequency component of the wavelet is used for PCA representation. Best features of PCA are selected using the genetic algorithm (GA). Support vector machine (SVM) and nearest neighbor classifier (ND) are used for classification. Classification accuracy is examined by changing number of training images, number of features and kernel function. Results are evaluated on ORL, FERET, Yale and YaleB databases. Experiments showed that proposed method gives a better recognition rate than other popular methods.

AB  - Performance and serviceable life of oil filled transformers are primarily governed by the behavior of insulating oil. Such transformers, during operation, may experience several stress evolving operating conditions. Deterioration in the performance of oil filled transformers are directly associated with the degradation of oil during the course of operation with different loading conditions. Further, the oil characteristics undergo appreciable variations since the chemical compositions in the oil are subjected to variations. Partial Discharges (PD) in insulating oil is one of the proven indices which exhibit the changing characteristics of oil. PD activity in oil insulating medium is influenced by several factors that are invariably directly correlated to the physics and chemistry of the insulant. The proposed article focuses on assessing the PD activity in different transformer oil insulations under different applied voltages. Further, the investigations also confined towards the correlation of PD phenomenon with Conduction Current (CC) through insulating oil. Various categories of iso-paraffin base and naphthenic base transformer oil have been taken into consideration which include new untreated oil, thermally degraded oil, oil degraded with transient signals and mixture of oil with solid dielectric materials. Detailed analysis based on experimental studies reveals that the dynamics of PD activity in degraded oil display unique discharge signatures when compared with new untreated oil. Also, it is evident that the PD activity is enhanced with the oil which contains a mixture of solid dielectric materials and with thermally degraded oil. Further, simultaneous measurement of conduction current and partial discharge activity in oil depicts that the dynamics of oil degradation is well observable in conduction current wave and correlation of both signatures yields better results interms of understanding the changes in oil behavior with time.

AB  - In this article, improvement of the memory effects and adjacent channel interference introduced by the nonlinearity of the power amplifier in the both Code division multiple access (CDMA) and Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing based (OFDM) transmitters is evaluated through Feedforward linearization method. For CDMA system, more than 17.27 dB increasing in OIP3 is and at least 25 dB improvement in adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) is obtained. For OFDM system, achieved improvement through Feedforward linearization method is at least 39.03 dB in third output intercept point (OIP3), more than 26.6 dB in ACPR and 5.44 dB in peak-toaverage ratio. It is observed that the designed Feedforward circuit can efficiently improve the nonlinearity caused by memory effects and saturation of the power amplifiers of CDMA cellular mobile telephony and OFDM wireless local area network (WLAN) transmitters.

AB  - The authors proposed a method for order reduction of linear dynamic systems using the advantages of the Interpolation criterion and Routh method. The denominator polynomial of the reduced order model is determined by using the Routh method while the numerator coefficients are computed by minimizing the integral square error between the original and the reduced system using Interpolation method. The proposed method guarantees stability of the reduced model, if the original high order system is stable system. A PID controller is designed for the high order original systems through its low order model proposed. Some numerical examples were considered to explain the effectiveness of the method.

AB  - Hardware implementation of the JPEG 2000 image compression standard for real-time image compression requires implementation of the adaptive arithmetic encoder among other related algorithms. In this work, a system level design for the adaptive arithmetic encoder used in the JPEG 2000 standard is proposed. This design is based on the assumption that the bit-sequence and its corresponding context, obtained through bit modeling for the encoder, are input to the system in their proper order. The output bit-sequence is also used as input to the encoder bit modeling. The original bit-sequence provides the context based on the assumption that the first pass is the cleanup pass and the first context is the Run Length context. All other contexts are recursively evaluated as arithmetic encoder encodes the bit sequence. The final encoding is lossless and results in perfect recovery of the original block image when proper decoding algorithm is used.

AB  - In this paper, a new topology is developed for a three-phase four-wire (3P4W) distribution system utilizing a zig-zag transformer along with three-phase threewire (3P3W) Unified Power Quality Conditioner (UPQC).In this proposed topology the neutral point of the star connected transformer, used for the connection of series active power filter (APF) of 3P3W UPQC, is utilized as a fourth wire for 3P4W distribution system. The zig-zag transformer is connected near the load to compensate the neutral current that may flow toward the neutral point of the series transformer of series APF. The series and shunt APF of 3P-3W UPQC are realized by readily available three-leg voltage source inverters (VSIs). For the mitigation of different power quality problems a control technique based on synchronous reference frame (SRF) theory is used for the control of UPQC. In this control scheme of UPQC, the current/voltage control is applied over the fundamental supply currents/voltages instead of fast changing APFs currents/voltages, there by reducing the computational delay and the required sensors. The performance of the proposed topology of UPQC is analyzed through simulations results using MATLAB software with its Simulink and Power System Block set toolboxes.

AB  - Incipient faults usually emerge from partial discharges which eventually cause insulation degradation between two insulated cable cores. Early detection of incipient faults is of particular importance because insulation defects caused by incipient faults may lead to permanent faults in underground distribution networks. This paper presents a novel approach using S-transform and support vector regression to predict the occurrence of incipient faults in underground cable networks. The results of this study proved that the new approach is capable to predict the existence of partial discharges in underground power cable systems in Malaysia.

AB  - Reduction of side lobe levels in a concentric ring arrays results in wide first null beamwidth. The authors propose a pattern synthesis method based on the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to reduce the side lobe levels of a concentric ring array of isotropic antennas while keeping the first null beamwidth (FNBW) fixed and variable by radial variation of amplitudes of the array elements. Two different cases have been studied, one with fixed initial interelement distance and another with optimum interelement distance for the entire array. The FNBW of the optimized array is kept equal to or less than that of a uniformly excited and 0.5 λ spaced concentric ring array of the same number of elements and rings. Results are also compared with Genetic Algorithm to establish its superiority.

AB  - The paper concerns the results related with GPGPU computing applied for mobile robotics applications. The scalable implementation of the point to point and point to plane 3D data registration methods with an improvement based on regular grid decomposition is shown. 3D data is delivered by mobile robot equipped with 3D laser measurement system for INDOOR environments. Presented empirical analysis of the implementation shows the On-Line computation capability using modern graphic processor unit NVIDIA GF 580. In the paper the discussion concerning the comparison between these two methods is given. It will be shown why the point to plain ICP implementation can achieve better performance than the point to point approach. We show parallel vector computation that is used for semantic objects identifications and for loop closing detection.

AB  - This paper discusses the conceptual and vocabulary problems users faced when searching the web and subsequently shows how a well structured thesaurus can be used as knowledge base for an interface that can assist user with search topic clarification. Recent research justified that thesaurus is useful in building ontology to help standardize terminologies and more importantly help to save time in building ontology that fully depend on domain expert. Several initiatives has been undertaken in web'ifying thesaurus with the idea of converting thesaurus or controlled vocabularies to semantic web standards such as Web Ontology (OWL). The aim of this research is to explore how thesaurus can be integrated into ontology development. Our research method emphasizes on semantic web technologies and the development of ontology using thesaurus, domain expert and reference sources such as Index Islamic us, encyclopedia, biographies etc. as the basis for implementing novel mechanism for retrieving Islamic web in 3 different languages simultaneously. As a result, we developed a framework for the development of Islamic ontology that advocates the symbiosis of thesaurus, domain expert and several reference sources in Islam as the basis for the construction of a multilingual ontology for our Islamic portal.

AB  - This paper explores a MAC (Medium Access Control) layer throughput with DCF (Distributed Coordination Function) protocol in the IEEE 802.11a/g/n-based mobile LAN. It is evaluated in Rayleigh fading wireless channel, using theoretical analysis method. The DCF throughput performance is analyzed by using the number of stations with both variable payload size and mobile speed on the condition that fading margin and transmission probability are fixed. In the IEEE 802.11n, A-MSDU (MAC Service Data Unit Aggregation) scheme is considered and number of subframe is used as the variable parameter. It is identified that MAC efficiency of IEEE 802.11n is the best out of four schemes.

AB  - A series of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE)-natural rubber (NR) blends of composition 80/10, 70/20, 60/30, 50/40 and 40/50 containing nano-sized fillers montmorillonite (MMT) and Titanium(IV) Oxide (TiO2) were produced by a twin-screw extruder with maleic anhydride grafted linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE-g-MAH) of 10 wt% as a compatibilizer. An electrical performance test through partial discharge (PD) characteristics using CIGRE Method II test was conducted to study the electrical performance of the samples. Applied voltage was set on 7kVrms for 1 hour. The discharge characteristics were observed using picoscope™ and LabView™ programming. Morphological analysis using scanning electron microscope (SEM) was also conducted after the sample of composite was subjected to high voltage stress. The degradation of composite surface was analyzed. Then tensile test carried out to investigate the mechanical performance of the composites. The combine results of PD characteristics and tensile properties described the insulating performance of the composites. The results revealed that total PD numbers decrease with increasing of weight percentages of natural rubber in the composition of the composite without any filler. In addition, it is found that total PD numbers significantly decreased on sample with MMT filler compared to TiO 2 one.

AB  - The shape of a popular split-ring defected ground structure (DGS) is modified by etching two concentric split-ring defective pattern which have different size and inverse split direction in the ground plane underneath a microstrip line. The frequency characteristics of proposed DGS unit show an attenuation zero close to the attenuation pole frequency. As a result, better transition sharpness is observed. An equivalent lumped L-C network is proposed to model the introduced DGS unit and corresponding L-C parameters are extracted. A 3rd order quasi-elliptic lowpass filter is designed by cascading the three investing DGS units under High-Low impedance microstrip line and the generated first harmonic has been removed with the help of defected microstrip structure (DMS) underneath the cascading DGS unit.

AB  - This paper presents application of a Bee Hive Algorithm to Economic Load Dispatch which considers practical constraints and non linear characteristics. The proposed ED formulation includes ramp rate limits, valve loading effects, multiple fuels, equality and inequality constraints, which usually are found simultaneously in realistic power systems. Conventional methods such as Lambda iteration and Base point participation are not able to obtain optimal solution for units having discontinuous fuel cost functions. Bee Hive Algorithm can overcome the difficulties and provides an almost global optimal solution, since they don't get stuck up at local optimum.

AB  - This paper proposes a text-independent speaker identification system based on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients as a feature extraction and Vector Quantization technique that would minimize the data required for processing. The correlation between the identification success rate and the various parameters of the system including the feature extraction tools and the data minimization technique will be examined. Extracted features of a speaker are quantized by a number of centroids and the K-mean algorithm has been integrated into the proposed speaker identification system. Such centroids constitute the codebook of that speaker. MFCC are calculated in both training and testing phases. To calculate these MFCC speakers uttered different words, once in a training session and once in a testing one. The speakers were identified according to the minimum quantization distance which was calculated between the centroids of each speaker in the training phase and the MFCC of individual speakers in the testing phase. Analysis was carried out to identify parameter values that could be used to improve the performance of the system. The experimental results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method under several conditions.

AB  - This paper proposes a methodology to limit the variations in generation cost in a power system under normal and contingent state using Differential Evolution (DE) optimization technique keeping consumer welfare in view. The aim of this proposed methodology is to minimize the deviations of generation cost, during contingency, from a preferred value by rescheduling of the generation with a controlled load curtailment technique and hence relieving the lines from overloading for congestion management. A comparative study between rescheduling with and without load curtailment has also been presented in this paper. Numerical results on test system, namely IEEE 30 Bus System, are presented for illustration purpose and the same has been verified by a well esteemed optimization technique, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The comprehensive simulation results establish that the developed method not only reduces the economic variations of the market but also ensures the voltage stability of the system during contingency.

AB  - This paper invents a methodology to synthesize proportional derivative controller for robotic manipulator. The proposed design methodology is based on exact feedback linearization method. A proportional derivative controller candidate which linearly approximates the nonlinear controller which is resulted from exact feedback linearization method is evaluated under Lyapunov stability condition. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying it to robotic manipulator model, obtaining the proportional derivative controller, simulating the closed loop behavior of the system. A comparison of the proposed method with exact feedback linearization method shows that there is no significant performance degradation when approximating exact feedback linearization by the proposed method.

AB  - This paper describes analysis, design and development of simulation software for Swine (H1N1) and Avian Influenza (H5N1) viruses recombination process. Influenza Pandemics have occurred several times, caused by mutation and recombination of Influenza viruses. Recombination is a sudden change of viruses enabling two different Influenza virus strains combined to become a new virus subtype. The H1N1 recombination has caused Spanish Flu Pandemic in 1918, and the recombination of swine virus, human virus and bird virus has caused Swine Flu Pandemic started in Mexico during April 2009. The main concern raised by WHO is the possibility of recombination between Swine Flu (H1N1), Avian Flu (H5N1) and Human Flu Virus (H3N2) which could trigger Swine Flu becomes more contagious, and have a higher CFR (Case Fatality Rate) causing more people to die. This research's purpose is to define modeling for virus recombination causing Influenza Pandemic phenomena. This research defines several different virus variants which can potentially trigger the Influenza Pandemic. Additionally, this simulation objective is to obtain most possible virus strains formed from the recombination, the scope within this article, which can potentially trigger Influenza Pandemic. New strains could be utilized to support the vaccine planning process. This simulation program was developed based on Genetic Algorithm method, for solving this multi-objective optimization problem. By utilizing Genetic Algorithm approach, the chromosome solution and fitness values/functions of Influenza Pandemic stages are defined and the maximum fitness values are to be searched. The simulation result of H1N1 and H5N1 recombination gave 2 best fitness values as static result and dynamic mean fitness values. Better and more fitness values could be obtained once the database of recombination and mutation virus strains is enhanced.

AB  - A six-phase AC motor is a conventional AC motor with two three-phase stator winding sets. Depending on the phase displacement, this motor can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. This paper investigates the optimal phase displacement to minimize the input current ripple of PWM inverter that is used to supply the motor. Single and double carriers are used in the PWM. Based on the analysis results, it is found that the optimal phase displacement is 60° when single carrier PWM is used and zero phase displacement when double carrier is used. Experimental results on six-phase induction motors with phase displacement of 0°, 30° and 60° are included to show the validity of the proposed analysis method. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Defining the process of type IRIS (Increasing Reward with Increasing Service) is one effort to get around the limitations of time available for execution. In this paper, the Double-Track Most Significant Operation First (DT-MSOF) strategy is proposed to improve system efficiency. In this strategy, the order of execution of the computing element according to their importance and the execution need only be done until the result is correct and/or acceptable. To know the performance of this strategy, two simulations are performed and an example of application is demonstrated. The simulation results show that the execution efficiency using DT-MSOF is better than DT-LSOF and DT-RSOF, measured by the percentage of executed computation. The demonstration indicates the possibility of implementation of this strategy on particular problem. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - A multilateration system estimates the position of emitter using time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements with a lateration algorithm. It involves solving a set of hyperbolic plane equations to determine the position of the emitter given the TDOA measurements that corresponds to the path difference (PD) measurement in distance. A performance model is developed using the relative maximum error bound (RMEB) which relates the plane equation condition number, the relative ground receiving station (GRS) geometry and the PD measurement error to estimate the position estimation (PE) error. By using air traffic monitoring for civil aviation as an application, Monte Carlo simulation verifies the PE error of the performance model for a square GRS configuration. The coverage assumed a 3600 bearing, a range of up to 200 km and a maximum altitude of 15 km. Simulation results also show that the performance model estimates the horizontal position error with a maximum absolute error of 0.1 km up to a range of 200 km at an altitude of 15 km and a minimum absolute error of 0.2 km at an altitude of 15 km. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - A Component-Based Software (CBS) system consists of integrated components that work together to perform specific tasks. Different components are selected and integrated to form a new software system. The components may have been developed by other third party, thus it is expected that the development time and effort can be reduced significantly. However just like any traditional development, the testing activities requires a specific evaluation to assess the software. Most of the components do not come with the source code, but only some information of the components. Thus, a specific testing technique is required. In this paper, we propose a new testing technique for Component-Based Software system. Older techniques had been developed based on traditional metrics, while other CBS system had different strategy from what we propose in this research. The technique help determining test adequacy criteria based on a set of complexity and criticality metrics of a CBS system. Based on this test adequacy criteria, our experimental studies have shown that it has assisted in reducing the number of test suite and test cases. For software testers, this technique would significantly reduce the testing time and effort in CBS development. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Several codes have been propounded to be implemented in Optical Code Division Multiple Access (OCDMA) using spectral amplitude coding (SAC). In this work, we suggest a new code structure for SAC-OCDMA system, we demonstrate theoretically and practically the good quality of the proposed system. The new code is called multi-identity high-power code (MIHP). This code with its architecture and facility of construction provides good performance with regard to BER. Without any constraint, MIHP codes can be adjusted to any number of users and weight. In this architecture the use of direct detection which reduces significantly the MAI. The result shows that the proposed code in SAC OCDMA system provides better performance and gave a BER equal to 8.70886e-17, the system using the suggested code can reach a length of 115 km for a bit error rate of 10−9 without using any amplifier. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Epilepsy is considered one of the most common neurological disorders. Epileptic seizures can be a major life disability that might result in loss of consciousness, and/or injury to oneself or others. This research work aims to develop an epileptic seizure detection method using electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis. We combine discrete wavelet transform (DWT), Shannon entropy, and statistical feature (standard deviation) to extract distinctive features of a given EEG signal. K-nearest neighbors (KNN) automatically classifies the EEG signal by comparing the extracted features with the features of the normal and seizure baseline. Adaptive learning is used to continuously update the two baselines based the user feedback, if needed, to improve its performance over the time. Our proposed method achieved an overall 94.5 % sensitivity tested with up to 570 hours of continuous EEG recording from ten patients with total of 55 seizure events taken from CHB-MIT database. With its simplicity and fast processing time, the proposed method is suitable to be implemented in embedded device which has limited processing resource. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - A Robust controller designed by employing internal model control (IMC) is presented for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive with estimation of both the rotor speed and the load torque with a predictive state observer. It is to achieve accurate control performance in the presence of uncertainties and system parameters variation. The Experimental results prove that the IMC controller with the presence of the predictive state observer greatly improves the performances of the speed loop and simplifies the design procedure. The robustness of this scheme is analysed, and the bounds of control parameters that ensure the drive stability are obtained. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The Symbol timing estimation in a high data rate mobile OFDM systems is a challenging task, this is due to the high delay spread. A conventional timing estimation based on autocorrelation experience performance degradation due to multipath channel distortion. To improve the performance of autocorrelation technique, we propose a normalized 3-rd order central moment for symmetric correlator as test statistics. When the training symbol is received, the distribution of the symmetric correlator is Rician distribution. This will be different from no training symbol is received, the distribution of the symmetric correlator is Rayleigh distribution. After we perform coarse timing estimation using a normalized 3-rd order central moment, fine timing estimation is done using the cyclic shift of a channel estimate. The simulations results have shown that our method is robust in the fading multipath channel and has better performance than the previous methods. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper deals with the problems of intermittency of primary source of wind energy and the external disturbances. Subsequently, a power management and a robust control of a standalone energy production unit are presented. This production unit comprising a variable speed wind turbine coupled to a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) and a module of Super-Capacitors (SC) that is considered as an Energy Storage System (ESS). This unit feeds a three-phase load by means of an inverter and an RLC filter. In order to assure a control strategy which has a very good performance despite the high nonlinearity of wind systems and an intermittence form of wind power, a second-order sliding mode control based on a super-twisting algorithm is applied to a PMSG. Then, a power management strategy is applied to the SC using a buck-boost converter according to load instructions and wind speed fluctuations. The response of the power algorithm enables to ensure the power flow exchange between the production unit and the power consumers and to protect the ESS against overcharge and excess discharge to ensure safe operation. Finally, using PI controllers, the inverter adjusts the capacitors voltages and currents at the output of the RLC filter with the nominal frequency and voltage. The simulation results show the robustness of the implanted control strategy. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Power transformer undergo aging overtime that degrades its insulation system. Oil-immersed paper insulation degradation in transformer can be assessed through the change in oil characteristics and the dissolved gases. Data related to these parameters are abundant, but study on correlation among these parameters and the operating time of power transformer is still limited. This paper presents statistical insights into aging of transformer insulation system through oil characteristics, dissolved gases and the operating time of transformer. As much as 219 in service 150 kV transformers population testing data were included in this study. The data was analyzed using linear regression correlation analysis to Figureure out the dependency of each parameters. Statistical correlation between each properties of oil insulation, dissolved gases and operating time were carried out. There are some oil properties that have correlation with operating time, which are color scale, IFT and acidity. Moreover, color scale, IFT and acidity shows dependency among them. IFT tends to gradually decrease while acidity increases as operating time trend rises. On the other hand, operating time are also highly correlated with CO and CO2, which are commonly known as the main product of paper insulation degradation in transformers. Correlation among prior correlated parameters found that CO is strongly correlated with color and IFT. Subsequently, a high correlation coefficient of parameter to operating time could be interpreted that the ageing process happens during the life of a transformer changes certain parameters which these changes should be noticed for better decision making whether the transformer still feasible to be used in the system with certain maintenance or should be replaced. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In this paper, three paradigms are used to deal with a robot manipulator control problem. These paradigms are feedback linearization method, approximating control by Taylor truncation, and sliding mode approach. Robotic manipulator is highly nonlinear, highly time-varying, and highly coupled. In robotic manipulator there are many uncertainties such as dynamic parameters (eg., inertia and payload conditions), dynamical effects (e.g., complex nonlinear frictions), and unmodeled dynamics. The classical linear controllers have many difficulties in treating these behaviors. To overcome this problem, sliding mode control (SMC) has been widely used as one of the precise and robust algorithms. Application of traditional SMC in nonlinear system uses exact feedback linearization. Geometric differential theory is used to develop exact linearization transformation of nonlinear dynamical system, by using nonlinear cancellation and state variable transformation. Hence, the controller can be synthesized by using the standard sliding mode for linear system. The main weak point of the exact linearization is that its implementation is difficult. This study presents a synthesis SMC based on approximating state feedback for robotic manipulator control system. This approximating state feedback is derived from exact feedback linearization. Based on approximating state feedback, sliding mode controller is derived. The closed loop stability is evaluated by using the Lyapunov like theory. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - A system of securing voice communication on mobile phone based on peer-to-peer SIP protocol (P2PSIP) is discussed in this paper. This paper presents a new key exchange protocol for secure Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) communication on mobile phones with P2PSIP. In this paper, security threats and issues in VoIP are analyzed. In our approach, we combine key exchange protocol based on the Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) public key cryptography with identity based user’s authentication, beside we use existent text message to exchange user information (identity, IP Address, and Port). The key exchange protocol is proposed to assure confidentiality and integrity of voice communication on mobile phone. We conducted security analysis between the proposed protocol with the existing ECDH protocol and compared their performance of key generating and key exchange time. The proposed method was validated by Scyther tool for proofing the proposed key exchange protocol. The experiment results showed that the combination of ECDH and authentication mechanism has proved to be secure against attacks. With the addition of the authentication scheme, total execution time of generate key and exchange key is slower by 11.70% than those of the original ECDH. Although the execution time run more slowly, we can guarantee that the VoIP communications still can be performed interactively without impairments because the key exchange process is carried out before communication between two peers begins. We conducted the confidentiality and integrity examination using Wireshark and Mean Opinion Score (MOS). Results of the Wireshark tool show that the VoIP communication is secure againts attacks. From the MOS measurements we obtained score 3.6 which means we achieve good quality and integrity of VoIP communication. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper deals with the active power flow control in a transmission line thus improving Available Transmission Capability (ATC) using Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC). For the analysis, a generator supplying two parallel transmission lines connected to a load as 2-bus system is considered. When the load increases, active power flow in the transmission lines is shared based on their limits depending on ATC which is based on power handling capacity according to the demand. Therefore, for effective control of the active power flow considering the power handling capacity, SSSC is connected in series with one of the transmission lines. SSSC controls the active power flow in transmission line by injecting voltage in quadrature to the line current. SSSC designed in this work is a Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) which provides pulses and would help to inject the required voltage in quadrature to the line current. The PWM pulses of the VSI based SSSC is generated by dsPIC microcontroller. SSSC is modeled under both MATLAB / Simulink environment and implemented on a scaled down model of 150 km, 15.6 mH transmission lines connected in between generator and load. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Fragile image watermarking could be used to authenticate a digital image due to modification or altering. A watermark is embedded into the image. When the image was modified or altered, the watermark is also altered or fragile. One of popular image format is GIF image. Some fragile watermarking algorithms are applied to the single GIF image only, none for animated images. However, we could modify the existing steganography algorithm to build a fragile watermarking scheme for any kind of GIF images (still images or animated images). In this paper, we reused EzStego to embed a watermark into the GIF images. EzStego is a steganography algorithm especially for hiding the message in the palette images such as the GIF images. The watermark, which is a binary image, is inserted into a GIF image based on EzStego embeddeing scheme. For increasing security, the watermark is encrypted with the random bits based on chaos system before embedding. To prove authentication of the image, the watermark is extracted from the watermarked image based on EzStego extraction scheme and then compare it with the original watermark. The fragile watermark indicates that the image has been altered. We also could find parts of the image that has been altered. We have tested the performance of the proposed scheme by doing some typical attacks to the watermarked images. Based on experiments results we conclude that the watermarking scheme can detect the authentication of the watermarked images due to the attacks. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The analysis of resonant frequency for anisotropic artificial circular dielectric resonator (CDR) encapsulated in waveguide is investigated theoretically. The anisotropic permittivity of CDR is established by taking a relative permittivity value in one direction higher than the values of other directions in cylindrical coordinate system. By deriving Maxwell time-dependent curl equations for the CDR inside of a short-ended circular waveguide and then applying proper boundary conditions for the waveguide walls, mathematical formulation to calculate resonant frequencies for transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) wave modes as the function of material thickness and the anisotropic permittivity value are determined. For a comparison, the analysis is also performed for conventional CDR loaded in the same waveguide. In this case, the conventional CDR uses a natural dielectric material with isotropic permittivity. From the results, it shows that the anisotropic artificial CDR has resonant frequencies lower than the conventional CDR for the first of 3 successive TE and TM wave modes. The significant impact in lowering resonant frequencies for the TE and TM wave modes are shown by the anisotropic permittivity in ρ-and z-directions, respectively. The anisotropic permittivities are able to reduce the resonant frequencies of conventional CDR up to 13.77%, 4.19%, and 5.99% for TE11 δ, TE21 δ, and TE01 δ wave modes, respectively and 43.07%, 35.98%, 34.86% for the TM01 δ, TM11 δ, and TM21 δ wave modes, respectively. These results can be applicable for wave mode selection. The anisotropic permittivity in ϕ-direction has no effect in lowering the TE and TM wave mode resonant frequencies. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - The hardest things in developing the question-answer system are to raise a question that comes from natural language sentences and to find the answers to some questions relevant to the query. In this paper, the strategy to be developed is how to apply a natural language processing using a technique automatically to generate questions and answers. A number of new ideas have been explored including a semantic-based template using a combination of semantic role labeling (SRL) with the predicate argument (PA) to create a semantic pattern within the scope of medical Indonesian sentences. It was more focused on Question Generating (QG) with a discourse task involving the following three steps: (1) Parsing the labeling of semantic-based element PICO with progression to PPPICCOODTQ (Problem, Patient, Intervention, Compare, Control, Outcome, Organs, Drug, Time, Quantity); (2) Identification and Transformation sentence; and (3) Filtering for answering Question construction. This study has presented a new approach by utilizing the semantic role labeling and flexibility template. This approach achieved the accuracy values of 0.80 simple sentence. The results showed the improvement of the performance of question generation from the information on medical outcomes. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - License Plate Recognition (LPR) is an application in the study of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition. Unfortunately, development of LPR is hampered by several technical problems such as specular reflection, blurry image, noises and other disturbing objects. There are a lot of LPR methods available. However, those methods are tested for samples outside Indonesia. In this paper, an LPR method for Indonesian cars is presented. This method consists of two main phases: plate localization and character recognition. Plate localization is performed by combining the modified horizontal edge processing, modified vertical edge processing, region of interest extraction and short object elimination. The character recognition is done by a modified template matching algorithm with some improvements in noise removal. From 80 samples used in the experiments, there are 63 successfully detected plates (78.75%). In the recognition phase, from all detected plates, the average Jacaard similarity index is 85.87% and the average remaining noise is 0.25. These results are considered to be good based on a Likert scale. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Operation of different induction motors as a part of controlled-speed electric drives, which carry out the same engineering problem, taking into account turning on of such devices as the transformer and the reducer is examined. A variability of parameters of equivalent circuits of the motors, linked with a modification of magnitudes and frequencies of voltage feeding the motors, and also with saturation of magnetic circuits and displacement of currents in windings of rotors is considered. Comparison of motors characteristics in static and dynamic regimes is carried out. Energy, weight, size and cost parameters are defined. The possibility of sampling of the best alternative of the drive, both on the above-stated indexes, and at cost of losses of active energy is justified. Modelling of a thermal state of motors in static and dynamic regimes is carried out. The analysis of vibroacoustic performance of the motors is made at operation in the certain circuit design of the electric drive on the given control range: vibrational velocity and vibrational acceleration of a magnetic origin, vibrational velocity of a mechanical origin (the radial and axial), ventilating and magnetic noise. Mechanical indexes (rigidity of the shaft, strength of the shaft and dynamic weightlifting capacity of the bearing), characterizing a mechanical state of an induction motor are observed and compared. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Attainment of enhanced secured optimal power flow (OPF) has been established as one of the vital requirement of power system operation in a deregulated structure. This paper establishes a novel hybrid technique which is yielded by combining Radial Basic Function Neural Network (RBFNN) and Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA). The new velocity and position of agents are less deviated by implementing RBFNN based GSA leading to realization of optimized Thyristor controlled series compensator (TCSC) parameters wherein the results are also compared with traditional GSA method and Fuzzy based GSA algorithm. The superiority of performance is established by comparing the proposed hybrid technique with the previously existing method. The Hybrid method proposed is implemented in MATLAB working platform and results are tested on standard IEEE 30 bus transmission system. The total generated power, power loss and cost of generation are evaluated with variation of system load and reduction in line power limit evaluates the system response to contingency. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In this paper, minimization of total harmonic distortion (THD) is discussed for the output voltage of multilevel inverter. THD minimization is an efficient method in reduction of the harmonic components of the inverter’s output voltage. In multilevel inverters, the switching angles can be selected in a way that the output voltage THD will be minimized. Given that THD minimization is an optimization problem, intelligent algorithm is found to be an appropriate alternative in this regard. Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm and Harmony Search Algorithm are employed to find optimum switching angles to generate desired voltage value in the possible minimum THD. The obtained results of two algorithms are compared with each other to determine that which algorithm is more efficient in this regard. Also, both simulation and experimental results indicate superiority of this approach over the published work using GA in this concept. The experiments are conducted on a seven-level inverter to validate the feasibility of presented approach. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - The proximity to high voltage power lines and gas pipelines is sometime; unavoidable for space reasons density of the soil. These pipelines are subject to electrica interference generated by power lines under normal and fault conditions. Due to thi interference, AC voltages and currents can be induced on the aerial metallic pipeline, whicl may present a risk of electric shock to the operator; also threaten the integrity of the pipeline equipment. This paper aims to examine the capacitive coupling and the various factors affecting the level of this coupling, using a combination of charge simulation method an genetic algorithms (GAs) for the optimal position and number of fictitious charges used ir CSM. The simulation results are compared with those obtained from the impedance matrix, a good agreement has been obtained. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper a hybrid method for improving the dynamic stability of the power system using UPFC is proposed. The novelty of the proposed method is combined performance of the Bat-inspired algorithm and Firefly Algorithm (FA), which provides improved searching ability, automatic subdivision and random reduction. Here, the bat-inspired algorithm optimizes the maximum power loss bus while the generator fault occurs, which inturn affects the power flow constraints like voltage, power loss, real and reactive power. For improving the dynamic performance, the optimum capacity of UPFC has been determined with minimum cost by using the FA algorithm. The attained capacity UPFC has been located in the affected location and analyzes the power flow of the system. The proposed method is implemented in the MATLAB/simulink platform with IEEE 30 and IEEE 14 standard bench mark system. The proposed method performance is evaluated by comparison with different techniques like hybridized Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and Bat algorithm. The comparison results proved the effectiveness of the proposed method and confirm its potential to solve the problem. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Minimization of Total Harmonic Distortion (MTHD) for the line-to-line output voltage of multilevel inverters has been studied in this work. Harmony Search (HS) Algorithm with artificial neural networks (ANN) has been employed to solve the aforementioned problem with considering constant and alterable DC sources in order to minimize Total Harmonic Distortion more efficiently. The nearest solutions provided by HSA obtain a smooth data set that is desired for the neural network training. MTHD is suitable for some cases, e.g. multilevel electrical drives and flexible AC transmission system devices such as multilevel static VAR compensator, multilevel unified power quality conditioner and multilevel unified power flow controller, where DC link voltages are altering. MTHD not only optimizes the switching angles, also finds the optimum values for DC links. In this work THD minimization with employing both constant and alterable DC sources has been researched and compared with each other. Also a comparison is made with a recently published paper using GA, which validates that the proposed scheme is more efficient in this regard. Numerical results for a test case, seven-level inverter, reveal that the presented method is feasible. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Distribution system planning (DSP) aims to ensure, that the electricity distribution can satisfy the demand in an optimum way. It has to provide the necessary economical, reliable, and secure electricity to consumer. Network solutions of DSP are the solutions that need adding and/or replacing some network asset. Traditional response is a large investment that creates large capacity. Therefore there may be unused capacity for period years. Thus, there is excess system capacity after the investment is made. In other hand, the alternative responses frequently install distributed generation in very small size. Original plan can be deferred by installing distributed generation. Investment using distributed generation is an option to defer the larger investment in distribution planning. Utility can use this option to face the uncertainty in demand projection. This paper proposes model for determining decision area of distributed generation investment as deferral option in industrial distribution system planning. It uses real option valuation to define the boundary by using the critical value. This study depicts the decision area by ‘discount rate’-‘electricity price on transmission’ and ‘discount rate’-‘delaying time’ boundary. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Condition monitoring of power transformers improves the reliability and the safety of an electrical power network. It protects the transformers from failures, and avoids huge revenue loss to utilities and customers. The health status of transformers is decided by several influencing factors. An accurate health assessment of transformers has been a challenging task for the researchers as well as the transformer diagnostic experts. In the present paper, a new fuzzy logic model is proposed to assess the impact of all such factors on the overall health index of the transformers, and in turn their health status. It incorporates the information obtained from various attributes which have been categorized into four different groups namely, transformers tests and measurements, visual inspection, maintenance and operation history, and design and fabrication. These attributes are initially assigned appropriate scores based on their present status/condition. Further, the proposed fuzzy logic model is developed based on the total scores attained by the four design categories. The present analysis avoids the over impact of the attributes thereby resulting in a more reliable and accurate health index of transformers. It overcomes the shortcomings of the conventional health assessment methods of transformers. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper focuses the hardware realization and implementation of speed-sensorless field oriented control of induction motor drive. For speed sensorless operation, natural observer is applied to estimate the stator currents, rotor fluxes, load torque and rotor speed because of its simple structure and no direct feedback. The configuration of the natural observer is comparable to and as well as its feature is identical to the induction motor. State space model is applied to both the estimator and the induction motor. Load torque adaptation is provided to estimate the load torque and, speed is estimated from the torque, rotor fluxes and stator currents. Direct field oriented sensorless vector control scheme is used and the rotor angle is calculated from the estimated rotor fluxes. Simulations as well as experimental results are presented for various speed and load conditions to demonstrate the performance of natural observer in sensorless vector control applications. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Conventional iron core CT gets saturated with increase in system X/R ratio, burden connected across it under normal condition and presence of DC component in symmetrical current waveform under faulty condition. CT saturation causes distance relay (DR) to under reach and operate it with certain time delay. The problem becomes more critical when fault takes place near to the boundary of first zone of DR. RC has become more popular for measurement of normal and complex transient current due to its inherent linearity, wide operating current range, reduced size, cost and its flexibility in operation. With the development of today’s microprocessor/numerical relay, Rogowski coil (RC) has become more suitable for protective relaying applications. This paper presents use of RC for measurement of current in distance protection scheme (DPS). Case study for validation of use of RC is carried out on Electric furnace system. The simulation results of DPS used for protection of part of 220kV IEEE 9 Bus system shows excellent performance of RC over conventional CT during normal and abnormal conditions. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This study aims to propose measuring the IT value, which is still in a lengthy discussion because concrete solutions have not existed to explicate it. Therefore, this study tries to present a sequence of methods to assess this value through both qualitative and quantitative methods. The presented methodology addresses the IT valuation by means of the IT value definition approach as a result of the division between the IT functions and the IT costs, which is achieved by analyzing functions and costs previously, consecutively, results in the intrinsic IT value. Additionally, this value at that point works together with the business environment, i.e. the Business Model Canvas so it brings up a new added value entitled an extrinsic IT value. Thus, the entire IT value manifests as the product of these two values. Furthermore, Telkom data appear to examine this valuation methodology, where the results show that an alignment appears between the presented valuation methodology and the case study, although it still needs a number of improvements. Based on this valuation methodology, the IT value engineering concept can be optimistic to continue research at the subsequent time. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In this paper, the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm - neuro fuzzy controller (NFC) technique is proposed for estimating the electric and magnetic field (EMF) of over head transmission line (OHTL). In the proposed method, the CS algorithm is used to optimize the conductor spacing (arrangements) and to minimize the EMF. From the optimized arrangement of the conductors, the EMF of the transmission lines is evaluated and formed as the datasets. Then the optimized data set values are applied to the input of the NFC. Subsequently, the coordinates are given to the input of the NFC which predicts their corresponding EMF data. The proposed method is implemented in the MATLAB working platform. For testing the performance of the proposed estimation methods, two overhead transmission line models with 110 kV and 400 kV respectively are considered. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method this is compared with the CS algorithm-ANN controller. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Saharan medium by its arid nature and the availability of solar immense in our country, 7.8 kWh/m2/day can return the application of the water pumping via photovoltaic (PV) pumping system. However, due to their relatively high cost, the sizing of these systems implies the use of an accurate tool. In this paper, a new practical formulation is proposed, in order to predict the daily pumped water quantity (Qd) for a given daily array energy output (Epv) profile and any total manometric head (H). The model based on the linear interpolation/extrapolation, called: translation of the Epv-Qd characteristics of pumps. This technique has been developed based on experimental study. This makes practical translation procedure much easier; only four ☐pv-Qd characteristics measured at any Epv and H can be used as the reference Epv-Qd characteristics. The calculated the Qd over a wide range of Epv and H well agree with experimental results of PV pumping system. These results indicate that the translation of the Epv-Qd characteristics based on this method is effective for estimating the performance of the PV pumping system under various climatic conditions. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Design of an intelligent flow measurement technique by ultrasonic transducers using an Optimized Artificial Neural Network (OANN) is discussed in this paper. The objectives of the present work are (i) to extend the linearity range of flow measurement to 100% of full scale input range, (ii) to make the flow measurement technique adaptive to variations in (a) pipe diameter, (b) liquid density, (c) liquid temperature, and (iii) to achieve objectives (i) and (ii) by using an optimized artificial neural network. The output of an ultrasonic transducer is frequency. It is converted to voltage by using a suitable data conversion circuit. A suitable optimal ANN is added, in place of conventional calibration circuit, in cascade to data conversion circuit. ANN is trained, and tested with simulated data considering various values of pipe diameter, liquid density, and liquid temperature. The proposed technique is then subjected to practical data for validation. Results show that the proposed technique has fulfilled the desired objectives. © 2015 School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a dynamically reconfigurable wireless network without any centralized administration or infrastructure. Here each node acts as a router for each other nodes. Data transmission over a wireless ad hoc network links in adverse weather condition affects the network performance. Therefore, deployment of MANET during rainstorm or unfavorable environment conditions should pay special attention to the probability of data loss and delay. Previous works carried to analyze the performance of routing protocol for MANET did not include the study of impact of weather condition. For real time implementation of MANETs, this type of study is more helpful. In this paper, the impact of weather condition on the performance of routing protocols AODV, DSR and ZRP is analyzed using QualNet 5.0 simulator. The results of simulation shows that, with the increase in intensity of precipitation, performance of the protocol is degraded in the metrics like packet delivery ratio, throughput, jitter and end-to-end delay. © 2015 School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In this paper, we present a Stand-alone Power system (SPS). The goal of this system is the ensuring of the electricity production without interruption in remote areas. It consists generally of a five components which are a solar energy, an energy storage that combines a water electrolyze and a storage gas tank, an energy conversion based on a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), an ultra-capacitor storage (UCap) and a suitable energy management unit to manage and to supervise the system operation of the hybrid system. This combination can ensure the optimal behavior of the load with the respect of the slow dynamics of the PEMFC. The integration UCap ensures the elimination of the slow dynamics of the PEMFC during the transient event. A Novel supervisory command is proposed. The modeling of the overall system is given and the obtained results are presented and discussed. © 2015 School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper investigates how effectively a fractional order controller (FOPID) works for Automatic Generation Control (AGC) issues in a multi area power system. Fractional order controllers gives better dynamic response results than the widely used conventional integer order controllers like IOPI or IOPID controller. Optimal gain setting of the integer and fractional order controllers are obtained by using Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm (BFOA) by minimizing an integral of time-weighted absolute error (ITAE) performance index. For the improvement of dynamic responses in a multi area power system, Capacitive Energy storage (CES) units are also implemented in its all control areas. The test system simulations are carried out in a Matlab/Simulink environment validates that BFOA based FOPID controller give better results than conventional controllers. © 2015 School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Macro Demand Spatial Approach (MDSA) is an approach introduced in long time electricity demand forecasting considering location. It will be used at transmission planning and policy decision on electricity infrastructure development in a region. In the model, MDSA combined with qualitative approach and quantitative approach as mixed method. QA used to determine main development area and supporting area in region.This method is used to prove the hypothesis that the observed transmission service area are not homogeneous.Main development area is an area with industrial domination as a driver of economic growth. Whilst, supporting area is an area with residential domination that supporting economic growth at main development area.Hence, the electricity demand driver variables are different for type of electricity consumer at different spatial characteristics. The variables have no significant effect can be reduced by using PCA. The results of PCA should be validated with the results of QA. Generated models formed from the variables generated by PCA. The generated models tested to assess whether it fit with the actual data. Range of interval confidence level used as fit criteria. At the case study, generated model for main development areas and supporting area in Southern Sumatra Regionas a part of Sumatra System is still in the range of confidence level. Thus, MDSA can be proposed as alternative approach on demand forecastingat transmission planning that considering location. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In this paper, a modern synthetic framework which has the capability to rapidly Classify and locate short circuit faults over transmission lines is presented. The proposed algorithm singles out short circuit faults based on the measured voltage waveform and three-phase current when fault events occur in power transmission lines. The values resulting from the three-phase currents and the three-phase voltages wavelet transform are used to fault classification algorithm. Then, fault location algorithm is activated as the result of fault classification. Different kinds of methods such as multilevel wavelet transform and support vector machine have been combined in a set to determine fault classification and location at every time. This paper lays out the fundamental concept of the proposed framework and introduces a pattern recognition approach via wavelet transform, statistical processing techniques, neural network (NN) and a joint decision-making mechanism. Voltage and the recorded current values in measurement devices from the fault moment to a quarter of post-fault have been used for preprocessing and training in the support vectors machines. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Due to the development of power networks and the ever increasing use of Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) instruments, the unpredicted interactions have been increased in the power system. Thus, the designing and setting of proper controllers is crucial for the improvement of the dynamic response of a power system along with the FACTS instruments. Because of that in this paper, a new optimization algorithm-based method of Fuzzy Adaptive Bacterial Foraging (FABF) has been used to design the Power System Stabilizer (PSS) and the Thyrist or Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) for damping the low frequency oscillations of the power system. The aim of this design is to minimize the deviation of speed and generators terminal voltage in a great range of loads with the use of FABF algorithm. Designing of TCSC and PSS has been both independently and simultaneously performed to confirm the discussed method. The comparison of this method with the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) in the4-machine Kundur system and the10-machine New England system, shows the superiority potential of this method. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In this paper the object tracking method using the combination of object's color and texture feature is presented. The HSV color components areused as color features and the texture feature is extracted using Local Binary Pattern. The Object is modeled into hue histogram, saturation histogram, value histogram, and texture histogram. In the tracking process, there is a process of color based object detection using the histogram back projection method using hue histogram saUuation histogram and value histogram from the object model. The process is continued with similarity measure between the texture histogram of object model with a texture histogram of the candidate objects using Bhattacharyya coefficient. The HSV. LBP and joint color-texture tracking methods are also tested for comparison. The experiment showsencouraging results where the proposed method highest average tracking rate is 94.98% and the lowest is 57.56%. The average tracking rate is 84.59%.The overall results show that the proposed method is better than the other tracking methods.The proposed method is also successful to track the object under several challenging conditions such as similar color or color distributionbetweenthe target object and the background, partial occlusion, changes in object orientation, and moving camera. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The principle achievement of this contribution is to develop and to describe a rapid DC component elimination strategy for AC currents in the frequency converter, simply by selecting transient period. To avoid DC component on the line current, it’s known that the transition of active and/or reactive power should not be rapid. If the transition time is relatively long compared to the fundamental period, the current may be considered as symmetrical and the DC component can be neglected. In comparison to the usually slow transient that characterizes a DC component free current transient; in this paper much faster transient also without DC component is achieved, simply by choosing a well-defined transition period. The present method is verified for a simple linear circuit. It can also be used, for example, with a three or more level inverter including, but not limited to, a Neutral Point Clamped. Simulation and verification results for different operating points and transitions between them highlight the capabilities of the proposed control strategy. These include the ability to operate with unity power factor and better current quality without continuous component. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics .All right reserved.

AB  - In this paper, a scenario based optimal power flow (OPF) is presented considering economic (operation cost minimization) and security objective functions. Security objective functions include both reliability and system transient stability improvement. Energy not supplied (ENS) cost is considered as the criterion for system reliability and critical clearing time (CCT) is considered as the criterion for power system dynamic stability. In order to reduce the computational burden of the proposed method, off-line training of neural network is used to determine CCT based on the system operating point. For this purpose, CCT parameter is calculated in Dig silent Software environment for various operating points of system and a data set is obtained to train neural network. In the proposed method, it is tried to improve dynamic stability of system, as well as decreasing the operation cost in post contingency state through optimal load shedding and generation rescheduling. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used as the optimization tool. The proposed framework is tested on IEEE 39-bus test system and results show efficiency of the proposed method. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics .All right reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a shunt active power filter performances based on threelevel (NPC) inverter using conventional pulse width modulation (PWM) and Ann’s controllers to mitigate current harmonics generated by non-linear loads. Shunt APF is the best solution to eliminate harmonics drawn from nonlinear load especially for low power system, the conventional scheme based on the two level inverter controlled by hysteresis controller presents several drawbacks such us high inverse voltage applied to power components, degraded output voltage inverter waveforms, etc. Today three-level (NPC) inverter and intelligent controllers are widely used in different industrial applications. To take advantages of these inverter topology and artificial intelligent controller performance a novel control scheme based on Ann’s current controller is proposed in this work. The control strategy adopted is the synchronous current detection method, it is easy to implement and permits a good extraction of reference currents compensation. The numerical simulation is performed using MATLAB-Simulink and SimPowerSystem Toolbox. The simulation results obtained in steady and transit states show the effectiveness and the superiority of Ann systems compared to PWM controller. © 2014, International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Transmission Network Expansion Planning (TNEP) is one of the major components of the electric power industry. In the deregulated power systems, transmission systems provide the required environment for the competition among the power market participants. In this paper a mathematical model and a methodology are presented to solve the TNEP problem with security consideration and high penetration of wind energy and uncertainties such as load and bid of producers in deregulated electricity markets. In proposed model construction cost of new network, congestion cost, paid cost of unsupplied energy and also the cost of security has been considered. Considering the cost of operation in normal mode and also observing the loading rate limits on generators at event are the benefits of proposed method. To expand the transmission network a sample test system with use of appropriate optimization methods in the presence of wind energy and network uncertainties are considered. In this context we will choose the best scenario in terms of economic and technical consideration to be introduced. The Planning methodology has been demonstrated on the modified IEEE 24-bus test system to show the feasibility and capabilities of the proposed algorithm. © 2014, International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Until now, internet congestion problem cannot be completely resolved. The main cause of the internet congestion is the control mechanism for dividing network capacity does not work effectively. Thus, the amount of data through the network can exceed the network capacity. Various studies based on the control system theory have been done to overcome this problem. This paper specifically examines congestion control system based on fuzzy logic mechanism. The proposed controller is fuzzy integral controller in the router and control signal processing that resides on the user side, which is modelled by first order system. This control technique is a congestion control with explicit feedback. The control calculation result, i.e. the divided capacity of the router, which is distributed fairly among all users, is explicitly given to the user. There are three simulation scenarios to show the performance of the proposed congestion control system. From the simulation results can be concluded that the congestion control system using fuzzy integral controller has succeeded in fairly allocating capacity routers and able to prevent internet congestion by keeping the aggregate data flow through the router does not exceed the service rate of the router. © 2014, International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The introduction of state equation model of the electrical machine based on direct and quadrature axes variables has paved the way for powerful control theories to be brought to bear on the problem of control of electric machines. Exact linearization has been applied to the control of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). In this paper, application of approximate linearization is proposed for the control of PMSM. Since the PMSM model is essentially quadratic, quadratic linearization is considered for the application. Conditions on the coordinate transformation and state feedback are derived for the linearization of a four dimensional permanent magnet (PM) machine model. The proposed linearization technique does not introduce singularities in the system as in the case of exact linearization. Also, to account for higher order nonlinearities including unmodelled dynamics, the linear zing transformations are adaptively tuned. Simulation studies verify the theoretical results presented. Hardware/software implementation is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the linearization technique proposed. The linearization technique proposed can also be applied to other types of electrical motors. © 2014, International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present experiment results on the implementation of consensus algorithm on a group of humanoid robots. The experiment in this work is based on some previous works on distributed control of robotic networks and distributed consensus in multi-vehicle cooperative control. According to Ren, a consensus may occur if communication topology between the robots forms a spanning tree. The existence of some shared informations is a necessary condition for this algorithm. Further, a consensus may occur if the topology of communication among the robots forms a spanning tree. However, to apply the algorithm on a group of humanoid robots we need some modification on the original algorithm. A new algorithm is proposed by adding a new damping variable (β) on original algorithm to make a group of humanoid robots move synchronously. The experiment of the new consensus algorithm is tested on two topologies, which are leader-follower and leaderless topology. This research concludes that consensus in a group of humanoid robot can be achieved by inducing damping variable in original equation. © 2014, International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Most successes in accelerating RL incorporated internal knowledge or human intervention into the learning system such as reward shaping, transfer learning, parameter tuning, and even heuristics. These approaches could be no longer solutions to RL acceleration when internal knowledge is not available. Since the learning convergence is determined by the size of the state space where the larger the state space the slower learning might become, reducing the state space by eliminating the insignificant ones can lead to faster learning. In this paper a novel algorithm called Online State Elimination in Accelerated Reinforcement Learning (OSE-ARL) is introduced. This algorithm accelerates the RL learning performance by distinguishing insignificant states from the significant one and then eliminating them from the state space in early learning episodes. Applying OSE-ARL in grid world robot navigation shows 1.46 times faster in achieving learning convergence. This algorithm is generally applicable for other robotic task challenges or general robotics learning with large scale state space. © 2014, International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The modeling and numerical analysis of seismo-electromagnetics perturbation are approached using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The research related seismo-electromagnetics perturbation recently has been implemented for earthquakes (EQs) precursor analysis by utilizing very low frequency (VLF) wave propagation. Here, the proposed method in two-dimensional (2D) form is applied to compute electromagnetics fields of the observed VLF wave and to investigate the phenomena of seismo-electromagnetics perturbation by modeling the geographical maps in two dimensions. To truncate the region of computation, the boundary condition of split-field perfectly matched layer (PML) is implemented. The parameters of investigation including the change of amplitude, frequency and time-shifting in the VLF wave are interpreted in term of changing the ionosphere layer which is confirmed as seismo-electromagnetics perturbation. From numerical result, it shows that the approaching technique using FDTD method is successfully to model the correlation between VLF wave propagation and perturbation wave associated with earthquake for different location. Moreover, some results related to time-shifting of VLF wave and frequency-influence of perturbation wave are also presented.

AB  - The experimental characterization in exploiting the property of microwave devices is an essential complement to theoretical and/or simulation works. Thus, the need of instrument for the characterization is becoming unavoidable thing to be established. This paper reports the development of test-fixture in form of a parallel plate waveguide (PPW) to characterize the reflectivity and/or transmittivity of microwave device whereby the property of reflection and/or transmission can be achieved under normal incidence. Since the PPW is excited using a rectangular waveguide, a transition section which connects the rectangular waveguide and the PPW needs to be investigated to have an optimum performance required for microwave devices characterization. The tapering effect of transition section is examined and analyzed numerically in yielding the influences to the test-fixture performance. Here, a WR248 type rectangular waveguide which has working frequency of 2.60GHz to 3.95GHz for TE10 mode is used as coaxial-to-waveguide transducer for exciting the PPW. The result shows that the linear-tapered transition has better performance in term of bandwidth compared to the step-tapered one. In addition, the discussions of taper length and number of step-tapered transition related to the performance of test-fixture as well as the experimental characterization for linear-tapered transition are also presented.

AB  - Application of MCSA for diagnosis of induction motors requires a well previously knowledge of various frequency components in stator current spectrum of motor in healthy state. This paper takes a closer look on healthy stator current spectrum content, which offers an important new contribution to enrich the most famous technique of fault diagnosis of induction motors. In aim to assure the obtaining of high space harmonics of motor, the TSFEM is used to model the healthy induction motor. The rotor and stator slotting are taken into account. Moreover, the paper reports an investigation about the magnetic saturation influence on the content of healthy stator current spectrum, for this purpose the linear and non-linear permeability are included in induction motor model. In order to show the impact of varying load on the healthy stator current spectrum content, the simulation results are extracted at different loads.

AB  - This paper is devoted to recovery voltage as a diagnostic non destructive method for an assessment of an insulating state of power transformers. The insulating pressboard used in power transformers is tested for different moisture levels. Experiments were carried out with samples from the same material intended to power transformers building. A charge and discharge of a capacitor having pressboard paper as dielectric is a suitable tool for an appreciation of the polarization and relaxation processes. The polar character of the water's molecules has an influence on the permittivity. Then the polarization of the paper will be affected by a moisture presence. Time evolution of the recovery voltage for different durations of the charges was examined. An increase of the recovery voltage with the moisture content was observed. The maximum of recovery voltage occurs much later starting from the moment of the opening of the circuit for higher moisture for all examined levels. Thus, the time separating the short circuit and the maximum's occurring can be considered like an important parameter allowing an appreciation of the moisture state of oil impregnated paper.

AB  - When the soil invaded by water as the grounding medium in green power generation sites near river basins, on the coast, is dominantly characterized in terms of its resistivity, the characteristics of the voltage and current waveforms on transient discharges such as the soil can be experimentally investigated using the liquid gap, reproducing the resistivity of the soil. The transient discharge characteristics is available information on the surge withstand rating of surge protective devices used in the green power generation sites. Experimental results on the behaviour of lightning impulse discharges in a tap-water gap are reported; these results show that the resistivity of tap water is nearly equal to those of a river and cultivated and marshy land. Further, (1) the discharge voltage and current waveforms indicate the periodic attenuated waveforms for one period, and the voltage waveforms indicate amplitude distortions; (2) the discharge impedance obtained using the fitting curves to the discharge waveforms ranges from 1 to 2.5 times that of the tap-water resistance, i.e., 80Ω, and from ĩ8 to 3.2 times that for positive and negative rod discharges.

AB  - In the last few decades the main focus of utility companies has been on developing diagnostic, location and pin pointing techniques for medium and high voltage cables, despite the fact that most of the installed cable assets on the network consist of low voltage cable. Egyptian distribution network is very complex network and has large lengths of underground cables, which mostly oil paper cables and XLPE cables. The network suffers from an increasingly faults at cable joints, where the main cause is the difficulty of oil paper cable joints which required a skilful technician. Large efforts are spent to categorize the types of faults happen at the cable joints to describe the avoiding methods of these faults. Benefits will be saving of operation cost, time and improvement of system availability and performance to avoid service outage which is a big lost for company and customer.

AB  - The investigation of the Partial Discharge Inception Voltage characteristic is performed by many researchers using the needle-plane electrode configuration and various test methods. This was conducted due to the capability of Partial Discharge Inception Voltage characteristic to represent or determine the condition of insulating liquid. This paper discusses the implementation of the needle-plane electrode configuration and two test methods to find out the characteristics of Partial Discharge in Partial Discharge Inception Voltage level of mineral oil. For this purposes, the mineral oil which used was Nynas Nitro 4000x with water content less than 10 ppm. In experiment, the test circuit was set up according to IEC 60270. The Ramp Method as the first test procedure was conducted in this experiment according to IEC 61294 with ramp rate of rise test voltage 1 kV/s until Partial Discharge Inception Voltage occurred. Meanwhile, a Combine Method as the second test procedure was used as comparative Partial Discharge Inception Voltage test technique. With this combine method, the test voltage was applied to the test object with rate of rise test voltage 1 kV/s until 70% of the Partial Discharge Inception Voltage value obtained from the ramp method. Then the test voltage was increased in steps with 1 kV/step with step duration of 1 minute until Partial Discharge Inception Voltage obtained with apparent charge ≥ 100 pC. The rest time between consecutive tests was 5 minutes. The needle tip radius that used as high voltage electrode were 10 μm and 20 μm, meanwhile brass plane electrode with diameter 75mm and 50mm was used as the grounded electrode. The gap distance between the needle electrodes toward ground electrode was fixed at 50 mm. The calculation of electric field stress of the needle-plane electrode configuration was done by using simulation of Finite Element Method (FEM). Based on the Partial Discharge Inception Voltage test result, the needle electrodes with tip radius 10 μm will produce electric field stress that higher than other needle tip, meanwhile the Partial Discharge Inception Voltage is lower which tested using both test method. By using the combine method, the Partial Discharge Inception Voltage value, charge quantity and the number of Partial Discharge will be lower than the ramp method. The results also showed that the Partial Discharge pulse currents using both test method was about 0.2-0.85 mA. The time duration of Partial Discharge pulse was in the range of 1.01-8.38 μs and the rise time were between 68-301 ns. It was found that the Partial Discharge Inception Voltage test result agree with the Weibull distribution.

AB  - Our goal in this article is to present a model based on the Vectorial modelling associated with the multimachine concept. And we finish this work by a simulation to understand the behavior of the machine pentaphase (polyphase) in normal mode. The polyphase machines are developed mainly in the field of variable speed drives of high power because increasing the number of phases on the one hand allows to reduce the dimensions of the components in power modulators energy and secondly to improve the operating safety. By a vector approach (vector space), it is possible to find a set of single-phase machine and/or two-phase fictitious equivalent to polyphase synchronous machine. These fictitious machines are coupled electrically and mechanically but decoupled magnetically. This approach leads to introduce the concept of the equivalent machine (multimachine multiconverter system MMS) which aims to analyze systems composed of multiple machines (or multiple converters) in electric drives. A first classification multimachine multiconverter system follows naturally from MMS formalism. We present an example of a pentaphasé synchronous machine.

AB  - This paper investigates the effects of the DC link voltage of a voltage source converter (VSC) on the performance of two current control strategies of the VSCs from point of views: capability of tracking the references signals with a zero steady-state error and imposing less transients during the step changes in the references signals of the controllers. Two conventional and multivariable proportional-integral (PI) based dq current controller strategy has been represented. Then based on the considering the worst step changes in the references signals of the VSC while the DC link voltage (Vdc) is varying, a specified range has been obtained for the Vdc. It has been depicted that the multivariable control strategy has less transient and more decoupling capability between d and q axis components of the current during the step changes which have been occurred in the various DC link voltage of the VSC. Also for tracking the reference signals, Vdc of the inverter must be in a particular range. Otherwise tracking the reference signals verifies that the axes are not fully decoupled or in some cases the system would be unstable.

AB  - This contribution describes an evaluation method for phase resolved patterns of partial discharges over time. Therefore, their specific shape characterizes patterns in question. The method searches for these characteristics within PRPD patterns by comparing characterization and PRPD using 2-dimensional cross-correlation. Crosscorrelation represents a measure for the similarity between different PRPD patterns. A use case determines the usability of the method in practice. The result is the time dependent occurrence of specific patterns, respectively specific PD sources. Long-term monitoring data of an aged generator step-up transformer with several PD sources of varying activity is used as PD dataset. PDs are recorded by the use of the electro magnetic PD measurement method, also known as the UHF-method.

AB  - The extensive use of non linear loads results in proliferation of voltage and current harmonics in an interconnected power system. Harmonic estimation without the information on the topology can be done using Independent Component Analysis(ICA). In this work, the time structured ICA algorithms - Fast ICA (FICA), Joint Approximate Diagonalisation of Eigen Matrices (JADE) and Entropy Bound Minimisation (EBM) are employed for harmonic voltage and current estimation by applying the principle of superposition. These algorithms are implemented on a IEEE 14 bus system. The Spearman's coefficient and the concurrent deviation method of correlation coefficient are formulated for performance comparison. However, when FICA is integrated with weight adjusted second order blind identification technique(WASOBI) resulting in FIWAS algorithm superior performance for estimating the even harmonics and other conventional harmonic frequencies is observed.

AB  - In this paper, a novel technique for on-line estimation of most electrical parameters of an induction motor is presented. Such estimation is important to achieve high performance drive systems. The proposed technique uses Volterra neural networks (VNN). This technique is based on the measurements of the stator voltages, currents and motor speed with no need for state-space modeling. Moreover, the VNN is implemented to relate the steadystate performance characteristics of an induction motor to their inputs. Simulation and practical results establish the validity of the proposed technique and show reasonable accuracy of the estimated parameters as well as excellent steady-state performance characteristics.

AB  - SF6 gas insulated switchgear plays an important role in electric power networks all over the world due to its merits as compared to traditional air insulated switchgear.The mixtures composed of a strongly electronegative gases with high dielectric strength such as SF6 and two ordinary gases such as N2 and Air or CO2 and Air with a various fractional concentrations are used in this paper to reduce the gas price and liquefaction temperature. From this point of view, various types of gas mixtures are used inside gas insulated switchgear (GIS) to give a higher dielectric strength. In this paper, the Finite Elements Method (FEM) is used to evaluate the potential and electric field distributions on and around contaminating filamentary wire particle at two positions, first is resting on the earthed plate and second is hovering inside the gap. The effects of particle dimensions such as (length, radius) and gap spacing on the electric field values are also studied. The breakdown voltage calculations under uniform field in case of clean gap and non-uniform field in case of gap with particle contamination are studied. The effects of gas pressure, SF6 gas concentration in mixture, gap spacing and particle dimensions on the breakdown voltage calculations are also studied.

AB  - Switching operations in a gas insulated substations generate very fast transient over voltages (VFTO) which are dangerous for the transformer and the system insulation because of their short rise time. Under special circumstances the terminal over voltages can arise close to the transformer BIL. The suppression of VFTO is very important in GIS systems. Different techniques are applied to 245 kV GIS model. The simulation used ATP-EMTP package program to evaluate the VFTO at the sensitive points in GIS. The different results are compared to determine the effective mitigation method. The results show that the wave steepness and the amplitudes of VFTO can be reduced to about 1Pu with less oscillation frequency.

AB  - Dielectric properties including relative permittivity, dielectric dissipation factor (DDF) and dc resistivity has been used widely as a design parameter of insulation system. In measuring dielectric properties of oil immersed material (OIM), we have to make some adaptations from IEC 60093 and IEC 60250.This paper is focused on dielectric properties measurement of oil immersed pressboard (OIP) i.e. related to the effect of live electrode corner shape, the effect of electrode's weight, and the applied the electric field stress and temperature.In this experiment, the solid and liquid dielectric wereoil immersed transformer board type B 3.1A and operated under mineral oil bath, Nynas Nytro 4000x. We concluded that, round-cornered electrode yields steep electric field enhancement at the oil side. This phenomena makes it easier to generate oil discharge in the wedgewhen compared to sharp-cornered electrode. For measuring dielectric properties at high voltage level, this phenomenon should take into account. It was also found that electrode with pressure higher than 1.9 N/cm2 gives enough pressure to prevent a thin oil layer that present on surface.We also notice that for small g/h ratio (the gap of guard and guarded electrode is small compared to the sample) or thick sample, the fringíng effect is high. Therefore calculation of effective area according to IEC 60093 is considerably applicable for thick sample. These results could be used as a consideration when measuring dielectric properties of oil immersed pressboardin compliment with IEC 60093 and IEC 60250.

AB  - Infrared wireless communication possesses two main attractive advantages over its radio frequency counterpart, namely the abundance of unregulated spectrum in 700nm - 1500nm region and the ease with which the IR radiation can be confined. Integrating microwave electronics and optics, it is possible to provide wideband communication services but it is well known that the signal level in an optical wireless receiver is weakest at the front end. This paper presents the concerned with a systematic approach to the design of receiver for indoor optical wireless communication. In particular, it is concerned with how one properly chooses the front-end preamplifier and biasing circuitry for the photodetector; and comparison of technique using bandwidth adjustment for better service quality with a bootstrapped transimpedance amplifier is presented. A controllable capacitance is introduced at the output of the second stage of the amplifier. This technique permits a bandwidth adjustment from 52Hz to 233MHz for a capacitance range of 10uF to 1pF.

AB  - This paper presents a control mechanism for Automatic Generation Control of multi generating interconnected power system. This control technique organise the excellent relationship between the electric load forecasting & Economic Load Dispatch for interconnected power system. The main component of LFC is to monitor the frequency nearly at constant standard value (50 Hz in India) & to regulate the net balance interchanged tie-line power flow between the different control areas within the prescribed limit. Since, electrical load is always fluctuating in nature & due to slow response of Area Control Error (ACE), needs some other means to overcome this limits& this leading to the forecasting technique to be incorporated with the Economic Load Dispatch for improved dynamic response of the power system. Load prediction technique is incorporated by Kalman filter recursive algorithm & then this bank of load is interpolated at a regular interval of 5 - minutes & these conceptscalled as "a very short-term load forecasting". Total forecasted demanded electric load is distributed among the different generating unit via participation factors in context with the concepts of Economic Load Dispatch & Generation allocation. Results & Discussion section of this paper support this control technique wisely for the given simulated interconnected power system.

AB  - Partial Discharge measurements are considered as a powerful technique for testing and monitoring the condition of high-voltage insulations sinceit serves as an early breakdown indicator. In the present contribution, the authors describe the fundamentally different propagation mechanisms of electrical impulses in the conventional measurement frequency range according IEC 60270 and in the ultra-high frequency range. Electromagnetic field simulation and measurements in GIS are used to elaborate the signal propagation mechanisms. The low-frequency components of the PD signals propagate mainly via the conductor, whereas the high-frequency components (UHF signals) are radiated as electromagnetic waves. The sensitivity and spectrum of the measurement depends strongly on the geometric position of the PD, damping and resonances of the propagation path, and the frequency response of the receiver. Due to their different, complex propagation mechanisms, apparent charge level after IEC 60270 and UHF antenna peak voltage cannot be compared directly nor can frequency spectra be easily used for deriving information about the physical nature of the defect.

AB  - The unique hydrophobicity transfer property of silicone rubber material ensures its good hydrophobicity when being polluted with pollutants. Earlier studies have shown that the migration of low molecular weight (LMW) components of polysiloxane from the bulk to the surface of silicone rubber is the root cause of the hydrophobicity transfer property. This migration process is influenced by the ambient conditions. In this paper the influence of temperature on the transfer property is investigated, and transfer characteristics on HTV-SR have been found which exhibit a saltus between 50° and 55°. The influence of humidity on the transfer property with different kinds of pollutants is investigated using the saturated salt solution method to control the relative air humidity. The results show that the influence of relative humidity is related with the hygroscopicity of soluble and non-soluble substances in pollutants on the surface. The hydrophobicity transfer property of HTV-SR polluted with 10 different kinds of inert materials is investigated, and the results show that different kinds of pollutants have a great influence on the hydrophobicity transfer property of HTV-SR. DC artificial pollution tests were conducted in Yunnan, China. The results show that the pollution flashover performance of composite insulators is closely related to the hydrophobicity state of the surface. The flashover voltage of composite suspension insulators rises with the increase of the transfer time and the mass fraction of kieselguhr in pollutants.

AB  - Pre-operative planning is very important in the process of a Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) because it is a method for determining the size and optimal implant position. According to experts from Medical Center of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKMMC), manual methods are still used to find a suitable implant size for the patient. By using the manual method, any error in template transformation such as rotating and scaling while recording the patient's hip bone radiographs prior to the surgery will lead to errors in determining the size of implant templates. Therefore, a digital method should be developed so that the implant size detection process can be effectively implemented. Manual implant template used by UKMMC is using as the basis for the hip joint implant design. This template is redesign using AutoCAD 2010 software. Template generated in AutoCAD format will be converting to JPEG format so that it can be used in Adobe Photoshop software for colouring and scaling. A total of ten X-ray patients were randomly selected to test the accuracy and effectiveness of the digital implant. Results showed this digital technique predicted stem component size well, with 80% within ±1 size and acetabular component was predicted slightly better with 90% within ±2 component size.

AB  - This paper presents a heuristic approach for optimal feeder reconfiguration of radial distribution systems (RDS). Optimal feeder reconfiguration involves the selection of the best set of branches to be opened by considering the all tie switches, such that the resulting RDS has the desired performance. Amongst the several performance criteria considered for optimal feeder reconfiguration, line maximizing loadability is an important one. In this paper an algorithm is proposed based on simple heuristic rules and identified an effective switch status configuration of distribution system for maximizing the line maximum loadability of the system. The line maximum loadability, power loss and voltage profile calculation of the best switching combination are found by load flow solution. Compared to other published articles, the proposed method reduces the switching combinations searched and gives the optimum solution in few number of load flow runs. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm, computer simulations are carried out on 33-bus system and the performance of the proposed method compared with the other existing methods.

AB  - A transient stability model based on back propagation neural network is used to analyze transient stability of Java-Bali electricity system, especially in calculating the critical clearing time. The real and the active load changes on each bus that shows the real load pattern of the system used as neural network input, while the target is the Critical Clearing Time (CCT). By using the load pattern as input, it is hoped that the robustness of the proposed method against load changes at multiple bus can be achieved. Data of target critical clearing time used for the training was calculated from the concept of One Machine Infinite Bus (OMIB), by reducing the multi-machine system using a combination of methods of Equal Area Criterion (EAC) through the Trapezoidal method and the Runge-Kutta 4th order method. To analyze transient stability, a three phase ground fault was conducted at one bus and assumed not changed during the simulation. The proposed method will be implemented at Java-Bali 500 kv power system. The simulation results show the calculation of critical clearing time from the proposed method has a minimum error of 0.0016% and a maximum error of 0.0419% compared with CCT by OMIB.

AB  - When a live streaming video is delivered over a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, the video is divided into several chunks and distributed to peers. Each chunk has its own playback time deadline. A chunk delay can be a problem of great concern because a serious chunk delay can produce obvious discontinuity of the streaming video, resulting in low satisfaction for a viewer. The playback time of a delayed chunk is overlapped with that of the next chunk. Traditionally, fast forwarding and uniform frame skipping are the two methods used to deal with the chunk delay problem. However, they may easily produce the effect of perceptual discontinuity and perceived by the viewer. This study proposes a frame dropping method based on frame loss visibility information in order to maintain visual continuity of the video. The frame with lower loss visibility will be dropped first. In a previous work, the idea of loss visibility was applied by a router to develop a frame dropping strategy when network congestion occurs. In this work, we apply it to the chunk-level playback controller in P2P network. The number of frames to be dropped is dependent on the value of chunk delay. Given a fixed chunk delay, the main difference between the proposed approach and the uniform frame skipping method is the way of choosing frames for dropping (fast forwarding method does not drop any frame but play all the frames at a faster speed). A viewer's satisfaction is evaluated by using the way of subjective video quality assessment. The proposed method can produce higher MOS (mean opinion score) than that of the traditional methods (fast forwarding and uniform frame skipping), demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

A new SVS auxiliary controller, known as the combined derivative of reactive power and derivative of computed internal voltage (CDRPDCIV) auxiliary controller has been developed and incorporated in the SVS control system located at the middle of a series compensated long transmission line to get most effective damping effect. The first IEEE benchmark model for analysis of torsional modes has been adopted. Eigen value analysis study is conducted for various levels of power transfer and series compensation. The results of eigen value analysis are validated by carrying out time domain analysis study based on non linear model. The proposed SVS auxiliary controller in coordination with CSC with its bang-bang form of control is very effective in damping power system oscillations over a wide operating range under large disturbance conditions thus enhancing the Transient performance of the power system.

AB  - Now-a-days SiGe HBTs are surpassing even the fastest III-V production devices in the high-speed orbit. The state-of-art in simulation of silicon germanium semiconductor devices is presented in this paper. A comprehensive course of action to model the device parameter characterization of High Frequency 0.1μm SiGe HBT is depicted which is based on the technique of direct parameter extraction. With the help of S-, Y- and Z- parameters, the equivalent circuit parameters have been extracted in a faultless approach. The intrinsic and the extrinsic elements of model are obtained using a direct extraction method that assists to find out the base resistance from the Z- parameters. In this, the issues entailed in simultaneous optimization of fmax and fT and related optimization of base resistance as well as junction capacitance are addressed. The device characteristics of the SiGe HBT are found much advance to those of III-V semiconductor devices. A corroboration of objective validity of the modeling scheme and the extraction of parameter is accomplished in the form of S-parameters. These results have been validated using a viable numerical device simulator ATLAS from Silvaco International.

AB  - The protection of series compensated lines is considered to be one of the most difficult tasks. The paper reviews the series compensated line protection challenges initially and presents state of art solution to improve the distance relay performance. The work describes the development and evaluation of an integrated adaptive distance protection scheme. Development of the adaptive scheme is in the specific area of incorporating the adaptive feature like adaptive reach setting of the relay as the compensation level changes in the series compensated lines, for optimum dependability and security of the protection system. The relay adapts its characteristics according to the informations received from the communication unit. Upon extensive testing on different data set of fault cases with fault resistance and varying percentage compensation level and fault location, performance of the developed method ensures that the proposed scheme overcomes the overreach/underreach problem of the distance relay in series compensated lines and is found to be quite promising.

AB  - In the specific area of data Modelling, data model patterns have been introduced and used to help creating high-quality conceptual data models. Generic data model patterns, in particular, are expected to be more useful in helping to solve more data Modelling problems in comparison to domain-specific patterns. A collection of generic patterns using Fully Communication Oriented Information Modelling (FCO-IM) as the Modelling approach is described in this paper. They can generally be divided into two categories: (1) Patterns that are based on the identification of an object, consist of 6 patterns; (2) Patterns that are based on the relation between two objects, consist of 7 patterns. The generic patterns are needed to be documented in full details and then to be shared in wider audience to have comments and improvements.

AB  - Relay coordination is very important from the point of view of security and healthy operation of power system. Relays should be organized in such a way that every relay should have at least one back up relay and coordination time interval between primary and secondary relays should be maintained. This paper presents the solution of relay coordination problem using Teaching learning based optimization technique (TLBO) by utilizing an IEEE 5 bus and IEEE 30 bus test system. The obtained results are compared with the results obtained from other contemporary meta-heuristic techniques like Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization technique (PSO). It is observed that TLBO is the best among those with respect to process speed. After this we have done an extension of the work by introducing critical element and network graph theory based relay minimization technique. It is expected that this analysis will be helpful to maintain the network reliability and healthy flow of power. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Oil immersed paper insulation condition is a crucial aspect of power transformer’s life condition diagnostics. The measurements testing database collected over the years made it possible for researchers to implement classification analysis to in-service power transformer. In order to generate a reliable model, more studies related to machine learning implementation to power transformer assessment need to be done. In this article, the objective of the study is to develop reliable new approach in transformer oil-immersed paper insulation condition assessment based on SVM-classifier model using its oil measurements. The measurements data (dielectric characteristics, dissolved gas analysis, and furanic compounds) of 149 transformers with primary voltage of 150 kV had been gathered and analyzed. The algorithm employed for developing classification model is Support Vector Machine (SVM). The model had been trained and tested using different datasets. Several different models have been created and the best has been chosen, resulting in 90.63% accuracy in predicting the oil-immersed paper insulation condition. Further implementation was executed to classify oil-paper condition of 19 transformers which Furan data is not available. The classification results were combined, reviewed, and compared to conventional assessment methods and standards. The comparation confirmed that the model developed has the ability to do classification of current oil-paper condition for the transformer population observed, based on Dissolved Gasses and Dielectric Characteristics. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In recent years, the solar energy has been considered as one of principal renewable energy sources for electric power generation. However, the maximization of extracted power from PV system is a matter of concern as its conversion efficiency is low. Therefore, a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller is necessary in a PV system for maximum power extraction. This paper presents a new Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm for Photovoltaic (PV) systems. The new method combines a novel strategy to identify the global maximum power point. In the proposed PV-MPPT system, a new control strategy creates two operating areas. In these two areas, the step-size changes adaptively from small step to large step. Thanks to this strategy all the drawbacks of the conventional technique have been eliminated. A SEPIC DC–DC converter was applied and controlled with MPPT techniques. The modified Incremental Conductance (IncCond) method is validated by simulation under real scenario of solar irradiation. Compared with conventional method, simulation results demonstrate the highest MPPT efficiency and the shortest convergence time of the proposed MPPT method even under fast changing of solar radiation. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In modern power system, plugged in electric vehicle plays a very vital role in regulation of system frequency as it is a form of battery energy storage system. This paper presents an aggregate model consisting of a three area system embedded with electric vehicle (EV) in all the three control areas along with Dish-Stirling solar thermal system (DSTS) in only Area-1. The thermal systems are provided with single reheat turbine, governor dead band and generation rate constraint of 3% per minute to give a more realistic view to the designed system. Two degree of freedom Proportional-Integral-Derivative (2DOF-PID) controller with filter is applied as secondary controller in all the three control areas. Maiden application of a new nature inspired optimization technique called Wind Driven Optimization technique in load frequency control is made in this paper. A comparison is done between 2DOF-PID and Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to verify the effectiveness of the former. Analysis reveals the advantage of including DSTS in the aggregate model which proves the role of renewable energy sources in overcoming the fluctuations in frequency and tie-line power in a power system under both nominal 1% step load perturbation and random load perturbation. An attempt has also been made to show the impact of incorporating EVs under nominal system condition into the system, and it has been observed that the number and magnitude of oscillations are decreased to great extent with its incorporation. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In this paper, a problem of mechanical modeling and robustly stabilization of a wind system formed by a turbine, a driving shaft and an induction machine, is considered. To overcome the complexity and the non-linearity of the system, the model of the wind generator is approximated by a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model. Hence, to stabilize the obtained fuzzy model, two command approaches were developed. They are the fuzzy controller using the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) and the H ∞ controller based-fuzzy observer. Numerical optimization problems using linear matrix inequality (LMI) and convex techniques are used to analyze the stability of the wind generator. Finally, simulation examples illustrating the control performance and dynamic behavior of the wind generator under various command approaches are presented. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In this paper Optimized Zero-Phase Low-Pass Filter (OZPLPF) based wind power dispatch optimization with an Energy Storage System (ESS). The novelty of the proposed method is Artificial Bees Colony (ABC) algorithm based filter coefficients optimization. Because, the conventional filters are works with the non-adaptive filter coefficients, which requires larger capacity of the ESS. Here, the ABC algorithm is finds the filter coefficients for various wind power generations. In order to achieve the adaptive coefficients Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is consider as the objective function. By using the optimized coefficients, the delay response has been eliminated and significantly reduces the capacity of the ESS. The proposed method is implemented in the MATLAB/simulink platform and the effectiveness of the method is verified by comparison with the conventional methods. The comparison results were proved the superiority of the proposed method. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Online speaker diarization and identification is the process of determining ‘who spoke when’ given an ongoing conversation or audio stream, in contrast to the offline scenario where the conversation has concluded and the entire file is available. Online identification is required when speaker identities need to be determined during or directly after speech, for instance in the automatic transcription of live broadcasts and of some meetings. The process of constructing an Indonesian language online speaker identification system is explored, from design, corpus development, to experimentation. The system conducts speaker identification directly on low-energy separated segments and employs a rolling window of time-weighted average likelihoods to improve accuracy, resulting in a system with a latency of one speaker segment for predictions. Experimentation against a standard baseline offline system resulted in speaker error rates (SER) of 25.5% and 18.5% for the proposed online and baseline offline systems, respectively. The latency of the proposed system is 0.21 times the length of input segments, compared to 1.10 for the baseline system. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - The pulsed electro-acoustic method (PEA) allows dynamic measurements of space charge density distribution with good temporal resolution and is suitable for both flat samples (a few hundred micrometers thickness) and coaxial cable samples. The response obtained by the technique is tributary to the electro-mechanical properties of the materials through which acoustic waves propagate. Hence, when dealing with multilayer dielectrics, the acoustic properties of individual layers are to be taken into account. Also, the acoustic attenuation and dispersion phenomena, especially when dealing with relatively thick samples, affect the space charge resolution at positions far away from the sensor. Therefore, application of a calibration procedure on experimental signals is necessary to recover space charge density profile from PEA raw signals and to provide real results on charge density both on its temporal and spatial dependence. We illustrate here in different samples configurations, spanning from flat samples, multi-layer and cable geometry, how the calibration is achieved and how the acoustic properties of materials impart the response. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper proposes a feature extraction method for a chord recognition, which gives a fewer number of feature extraction coefficients than the previous works. The method of the proposed feature extraction is segment averaging with SHPS (Simplified Harmonic Product Spectrum) and logarithmic scaling. The chords used in developing the proposed feature extraction were guitar chords. In a more detail, the method of the proposed feature extraction basically is as follows. Firstly, the input signal is transformed using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). Secondly, the left portion of the transformed signal is then processed in succession using SHPS, logarithmic scaling, and segment averaging. The output of segment averaging is the result of the proposed feature extraction. Based on the test results, the proposed feature extraction is quite efficient for use in chord recognition, since it requires only at least eight coefficients to represent each chord. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Although the OFDM system has been gaining importance in recent years, the high peak to average power ratio is considered the main limitation of the system. The oversampling operation in the frequency-domain plays an essential role in the PAPR calculations precisely. The main purpose of the paper to draw attention to zero-padding methods which are used to oversampled baseband OFDM signals. Moreover, to study the influence of the zero-padding methods on the accuracy of the PAPR calculations, and the spectral spreading of the OFDM signals. Simulation results show that the zero-padding method which inserts the zeros at the center of the baseband OFDM signal is better than the other zero-padding methods in terms of both accuracy PAPR calculations and spectral distribution. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Grounding impedance is an important component of electrical power systems especially for protection for human safety and the continuity of the operation of power systems. At low frequency current injection the characteristics of grounding impedance is very resistive, however at high frequency it may be capacitive or inductive depending on the frequency. In order to build a grounding system used for lightning protection, it needs a careful and accurate design. It will receive high current and high frequency around hundred kilos up to mega hertz, otherwise it is simple grounding for low frequency. This paper reports the modification of a grounding system with vertical layers configuration. This is the novel issue because the other researchers use horizontal layers configuration. In this experiment, the grounding rod is injected by using low to high frequency AC source The modification is made by filling the soil into a grounding rod (cylinder rod) and therefore it created two soil layers of grounding system, and by using three size variations of cylindrical layers of length (L) of 40, 60, and 100 cm; and three size variations of diameter (D) of 20, 30, and 40 cm. These variations will allow us to understand the characteristic of the grounding impedance at low and high frequency, where usually the composition of inner layer soil have lower resistance than the outer soil. The composition of the outer soil consist of 16.85 % clay, 66.18 % silt, 15.48 % sand, and 1.49 % gravel whereas the composition for the inner/filling soil consist of 34.98% clay, 49.55% silt, 15.35% sand, and 0.16% gravel. The value of soil permittivity and resistivity affect the value of grounding impedance at low and high frequency. In general, the results indicated that the grounding impedance at high frequency was higher than at low frequency, but the fluctuation of grounding impedance depended on the condition of inner soil, length and diameter of cylindrical rod. In this research, the grounding impedance was plotted as the function of the frequency and until now the value of this fluctuation cannot be determined accurately. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In this research, we build a question answering system that can answer comparative questions. Our system contains two components, question analysis and answer processing. In question analysis, we use information extraction method to extract entities, aspects, relations, and constants from the question. We also classify the question into five question types such as entity-mentioned, entity-other, entity-all, aspect, and yes/no. These processes in question analysis component are solved by machine learning technique. In answer processing component, we process the comparison by using word lists and rules. The result of comparison processing is used to find the answer by generating query to get relevant data from the database. The query generation process is performed by using rules based on the question type. After that, the data from database is also processed based on question type to generate the answer. Based on the experiment results, our proposed method for comparison question answering system is promising. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two approaches of collision avoidance (CA) control design are discussed: the stochastic process-based CA and the reactive CA. We believe that the well-established stochastic process-based CA that has been widely used in general aviation flights may not work well in UAV flights for at least two reasons: the difference in encounter characteristics, and the difference in available resource provisions. Problems on reactive CA and search-based CA are mostly simplified to two-dimensional flight cases and depend heavily on nonpartisan observer in providing motion data to the onboard controller, thus resulting CA control systems that are ever-dependent to external sensory resources. This shortcoming can potentially be solved using kinematic-based collision threat situation (CTS) model. Existing CTS models using ‘collision cone’ or velocity obstacle (VO) approach are discussed. These models reveal the existence of an infinite number of evasion planes for a given initial threat situation, which requires the CA controller using such approach to search for a plane that provides the most efficient evasive maneuver, which in turn requires more computing power and time. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a CTS model that is based on the kinematic relation between pair of bodies involved in a CTS. We also define the state of the CTS model and construct the CA controller to reduce the value of the state of the CTS. Since the CTS is evaluated in relative motion context between the bodies, the resulting model is readily compatible with output data from onboard sensors, eliminating the need to perform coordinate transformation that will in turn improving the computational efficiency of the whole CA control system. Furthermore, the model also provides us a deterministic evasion plane, thus eliminating the need to perform a search procedure. The performance of our CA control design is evaluated using energy-based function and a series of simulations. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Navigation equipment specifications differs in the update rate, accuracy, budget, reliability, size and mass. In some applications in order to meet navigation system requirement, a dead reckoning equipment i.e. Inertial Navigation System INS is could be integrated with one or many position fixing equipment, i.e. Global Navigation Satellite System GNSS. INS and GPS have different benefits and drawbacks, and they complement each other when integrating them to provide a navigation solution with higher bandwidth, and long-term and short-term accuracy. This research investigates the performance of an integrated system GPS/INS(MEMS) when changing the algorithm update rate, and compare between different integration algorithm namely loosely and tightly integration. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The article focuses towards the development of an optimal secondary controller which could adapt with the varying system conditions to maintain the frequency and tie-line power flow variations within the nominal value. For the analysis, a two area multi source system consisting of thermal, hydro and nuclear system in one area is interconnected with another area comprising of thermal and hydro system via parallel AC-DC links. On subjection to unit step load change in demand, the impact on frequency and tie-line power flow variations in multi source multi area is observed under MATLAB/Simulink environment. The fine tuning of frequency and tie-line power flow variations is achieved with the help of secondary controller. Optimal secondary Proportional Integral (PI) controller is chosen based on Zeigler Nichols’ (ZN), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Fuzzy Gain Scheduling (FGS) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) tuning techniques. On subjection to different load variations at different intervals of time, ANFIS tuned PI controller has retained the frequency and tie-line power variations for a robust multi source multi area system interconnected via parallel AC-DC links in a much faster way to its nominal values than other methods. The performance of the controller is evaluated based on performance indices. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Software engineering activities comprise of several activities to ensure that the quality product will be achieved at the end. Some of these activities are software testing, inspection, formal verification and software defect prediction. Many researchers have been developed several models for defect prediction. These models are based on machine learning techniques and statistical analysis techniques. The main objective of these models are to identify the defects before the delivery of the software to the end user. This prediction helps project managers to effectively utilize the resources for better quality assurance. Sometimes, a single defect can cause the entire system failure and most of the time they drop the quality of the software system drastically. Early identification of defects can also help to make a better process plan which can handle the defects effectively and increase the customer satisfaction level. But the accurate prediction of defects in software is not an easy task because this is an indirect measure. Therefore, it is important to find suitable and significant measures which are most relevant for finding the defects in the software system. This paper presents a feature selection based model to predict the defects in a given software module. The most relevant features are extracted from all features with the help of seven feature selection techniques and eight classifiers are used to classify the modules. Six NASA software engineering defects prediction data sets are used in this work. Several performance parameters are also calculated for measuring the performance and validation of this work and the results of the experiments revealed that the proposed model has more capability to predict the software defects. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Stability is a major issue which explains stable operation of electrical power system. Conventional methods adopted for the enhancement of transient stability (TS) include circuit breakers, fast acting exciters, and reduced total transfer reactance of the system. In this paper, Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) controller is used for effective utilization of transmission system. This controller improves the performance of transient stability (TS) and power flow. Simulations are performed to enhance the TS of Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) 9 bus and 5 bus test systems with fixed compensation on different lines, and the optimal placement has been examined for improved results. For further improving the transient stability margin (TSM), a Thyristor Controlled Series Controller (TCSC) has been employed, and the simulation results show the suitability and effectiveness of TCSC for enhancing TS of power system. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper addresses the supply of power to the stand-alone load at constant voltage and constant frequency (CVCF), from a variable source distributed generation system. The inherent problem of having a fixed output from a variable input is prominent in all of the distributed generation systems, run by uncertain renewable sources like wind. This paper proposes a topology to maintain output load voltages and frequency during changes in both input torque and load perturbation. The control is designed for both the generator side and load side converters, connected as a back-to-back converter with one dc link capacitor. The voltage across dc link capacitor is maintained at a desired level by power flow control through the generator side voltage source converter (VSC). The proposed three-stage controller technique for the generator side converter is analysed and tested in all operating conditions. The outer most dc link voltage error is passing through the controller is generating the speed reference of the speed controller. Then the inner loop current controller follows the speed controller. The load side VSC is controlled to produce a constant voltage at the output of the load side filter. The stand-alone system has successfully been tested in the simulation environment. It is found to be capable of maintaining input power level to the demand, even with 50% increment in load and 50% increment in input torque. These dynamic responses of the variables are found to be satisfactory throughout the operation. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lung Nodule is a white patch on the thorax medical image, usually used as an early marker of lung cancer. This research aims to produce algorithms that can detect lung nodules automatically in CT images, by utilizing a combination of hybrid computing between Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphical Processing Unit (GPU). The framework used is Compute Unified Device Architecture, which consists of platform and programming model. The algorithm consists of several steps; read DICOM and data normalization, lung segmentation, candidate nodule extraction, and classification. Normalization is required to facilitate calculation by changing the data type ui16 to ui8. Furthermore, segmentation is used to separate the lung parts with other organs, where at this stage the Otsu Algorithm and Moore Neighborhood Tracing (MNT) are used. The next step is Lung Nodule Extraction, which aims to find the nodule candidate. The last step is a classification that utilizes the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to distinguish which one is nodule or not. The algorithm successfully detects near round nodules that are free-standing or not attached to other parts of organs. After undergoing ground truth tests, it was found that under some conditions, the algorithm has not been able to distinguish nodules and other strokes that resemble nodules. While in terms of computing speed is found a very surprising result because overall single CPU computing provides better results compared to hybrid CPU and GPU computing. Multiple morphology and transmission time to GPU contributed to the double execution time of hybrid model compared to single CPU. Adjustment in dataset grouping by detecting the nodule simultaneously for several dataset will also improve the performance of hybrid CPU and GPU computation. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This piece of work deals with implementing a new meta-heuristic algorithm symbiotic organisms search to address multi-objective optimal power flow (OPF) problems in power systems considering several operational constraints. The algorithm has been implemented on IEEE 30 and IEEE 118 bus test systems for various single objective and bi-objective functions to assess its efficacy in solving the OPF problem and its ability to handle large systems. A comparative study of the results, predominantly considering those obtained using quasi oppositional teaching learning optimization(QOTLBO), teaching learning optimization (TLBO), multiobjective harmony search algorithm (MOHS), nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) from the literature are detailed in this paper. Investigation of the results reveal that the algorithm is successful in producing superior results for both the systems and its performance is also encouraging in solving conflicting objectives. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The capability of new 9-slot 8-pole permanent magnet BLDC motor to start without position sensor is investigated in this paper. The permanent magnet rotor influences the stator windings inductance as the rotor position changes. It leads to variation of motor current. Sensorless control of BLDC motor usually uses back EMF method, but this method cannot be used from standstill, since there is no back EMF. To start this motor smoothly from standstill, the rotor position can be estimated using inductance variation method by injecting high frequency low current to the stator windings. The new 9-slot 8-pole PM BLDC motor has the advantage of its asymmetrical windings. It generates unique current responses when injected by sinusoidal high frequency current on different rotor positions. The current responses then can be separated by fuzzy logic algorithm to determine the rotor position. The experimental results of the estimated rotor position sector with the experimental system are shown in this paper. From these results, the sensorless starting using inductance variation method is applicable to the 9-slot 8-pole motor. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of data sampling techniques on the performance of learners using real highly imbalanced Spanish bankruptcy dataset. The class imbalance problem refers to the highly uneven distribution of class instances where one class is having most of the instances than others. In the presence of highly skewed data distribution, the performance of classical learners is heavily biased in recognizing the majority class and consequently leads to the performance degradation of quantitative classifier or predictors models. In this paper, six sampling methods such as synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), Borderline-SMOTE, Safe-level-SMOTE, Random under sampling, random oversampling and condensed nearest neighbor are used with a different individual(SVM, C4.5, and Logistic regression) and ensemble learners(AdaBoostM1, DTBagging, and Random Forests). The different quantitative prediction models are designed by combination data sampling techniques and classical learners. The performance of quantitative prediction models are evaluated using G-Mean and area under the curve (AUC) measures on the real highly imbalanced data set. The result suggest that the performance of oversampling (with LR and DTBagging) and undersampling (with C4.5 and RF) methods are superior as compare to others on this data set. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper proposes an Adaptive Selective Cuckoo Search Algorithm (ASCSA) for solving bi-objective short-term hydrothermal scheduling (BOSTHTS). The major purpose of the BOSTHTS problem is to reduce electric generation fuel cost and polluted emission from all considered thermal generating units over a scheduled intervals. In addition, the problem also takes all constraints of hydrothermal power systems such as real power demand of load, limitations of generations and limitations of reservoirs into account. The proposed method is constructed by tackling all drawbacks of classical Cuckoo Search algorithm (CCSA) so as to shorten number of iterations and fast converge to good solutions. The proposed method together with CCSA and another modified version of CCSA (MCSA) are implemented for two different systems with different types of fuel cost form and emission form and results from these methods are also compared to other existing methods. Objective comparisons and computation time comparisons indicate that the proposed method is superior to CCSA, MCSA and other compared methods. As a result, the proposed method is considered to be a strong optimization method for the considered BOSTHTS problem. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - The advent of cloud computing has transformed the way companies managing their information technology (IT) and information systems (IS). Cloud computing provides three different service models, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). This study was aimed to analyse the effects of IT infrastructure transformation into IaaS model on the changes in IT management capabilities. Based on the literature review, a research framework was developed. The framework suggests four IT capabilities components that can contribute to organizational agility, namely IT supply management, IT-business partnership, IT proactive posture and Change readiness IT capability. The framework was used to guide a case study to collect empirical data in a telecommunication company in Indonesia. Analysing the results of the case study, changes in the organization’s IT capabilities as the impact of IaaS adoption were discussed. This study provides insights into efforts to develop the required IT capabilities in order to realise the benefits from cloud computing adoption, in particular the IaaS. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Indonesia e-cash system faced with some challenges. Lack of proper network infrastructure impedes the distribution of e-cash throughout the country. Most existing e-cash scheme designed for usage with proper network infrastructure, mainly for validating the transaction. Existing peer-to-peer e-cash scheme also require proper network infrastructure, either for public key request or deposit the received e-cash. This paper proposed a novel e-cash scheme by building its e-cash data as chain of transaction (block chain) using identity-based signcryption as its security mechanism. The combination of block chain and identity-based signcryption make the e-cash peer-to-peer, transferable, and able to operate on ad hoc network. The Markov chain evaluation show that the proposed scheme can achieve security against forgery and double spending. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a disease that is characterized by glycemic disorders, including sustained chronic hyperglycemia and acute glucose fluctuations. Because DM is closely related to the body metabolism, the observation of the blood vessels becomes very important to perform. The observation is done by using the Mean Amplitude of Glycemic Excursion (MAGE). Definitively, MAGE is an important variable to solve clinical DM problems that contributes in generating oxidative stress related to the macro and micro-vascular complications. MAGE is technically used with continuous blood glucose data which is obtained by Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM). Because of the CGM is expensive for personal use, it cannot be used in the daily observation. The contribution of this study is the utilization of discrete data (3 days observation) to be used in MAGE measurement. This research employs Spline Interpolation technique to convert discrete blood glucose data to continuous signal. The validation of interpolated signal is conducted by comparing the pattern of discrete data and continuous signal for both original and clustered data. The experiment showed that both scenarios depicted identical pattern. The smallest RMSE was achieved by Linear Spline with 57.66 while the highest RMSE value was obtained by Quadratic Spline with 177.00. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In Software-Defined Networking (SDN), even though centralized information on network condition is available at the controller, this information is not used to improve network condition when congestion happens. SDN requires policy embedded in the controller to manage its network, e.g., strategy for network resource allocation. In this paper, we propose an optimal rate allocation schemes to support congestion control in SDN. Congestion control and rate allocation are like two sides of the same coin. Optimal rate allocation can reduce congestion probability, such that a complicated congestion control is not required. This rate allocation is based on mathematical optimization using three optimization criteria, i.e., minimization on mean transmission time, minimization on standard deviation, and allocation based on proportional rate allocation. The minimization problem for mean and standard deviation are solved using Lagrange method, while proportional rate allocation problem is solved using linear equation. The simulation results show that our proposed formula for rate allocation schemes using rate information provides better performance compared to rate allocation schemes without rate information. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which implement a group-based classification algorithm, theoretically has the benefit of higher accuracy. Unfortunately, higher accuracy only achieved if the observed group is homogeneous from a certain distribution. Recently, a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack consists of multiple botnets which produce multi types of traffic in one attack session. It makes the IDS suffers from decreasing accuracy as the increasing heterogeneity within the observed group. To address the problem, we propose homogeneous grouping algorithm based on triangle area Mahalanobis distance to support IDS which implement group-based data analysis. First, the Mahalanobis distance measurement was used to construct homogeneous groups. Then, the covariance matrix of each homogeneous group was classified using a decision tree classifier. Classification performance was evaluated using known KDDCup 99 dataset. The results pointed out that the used of homogeneous grouping algorithm improve the classification performance for natural and mixed random DDoS traffic. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This article presents an advanced continuous wavelet transform (CWT) based approach for fault detection and localization in distribution systems using the artificial neural network (ANN). In this study, CWT extracts distinct features from the transient signals captured from the bus. The derived features are utilized to train and test appropriate ANN architecture in different stages to detect and localize the faults. The proposed scheme provides an optimum method for classification as well as localization of the various kinds of fault with different source short circuit (SSC) level in different locations. The whole detection and localization process consists of several stages. In the first stage, it detects faulty feeder. The faulty line is identified in the second stage. Finally, in the third stage, fault type and fault location are being calculated from the relaying point. The performance of the proposed CWT-ANN based approach is quite promising as compared to traditionally used algorithms. However, a correlation-based feature selection technique is also implemented to reduce training time and improve accuracy. This algorithm is tested in 11 kV radial Indian distribution network but can be applied in other distribution networks also. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Condition monitoring of power transformers improves the security and reliability of an electrical power system. It protects the transformers from failures, and avoids huge revenue loss to utilities and customers. The fault diagnosis of transformers is carried out by concentrations of several dissolved gasses. An accurate fault diagnosis of transformers has been a critical problem for diagnostic experts of transformers. In this article, a novel fuzzy logic model has been proposed to determine the transformer incipient faults. It incorporates the information obtained from dissolved gas analysis test. Further, the proposed model also incorporates conventional fault diagnosis methods viz. Duval Triangle, Doernenburg, Rogers, and IEC ratio code methods. The proposed fuzzy logic models short out the problems occur in the conventional fault diagnosis methods of transformers. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Distillation is the most common method for separating components in chemical unit operation. This paper presents the mini batch distillation column modeling to facilitate a closed loop control design in the later stage. This mini plant is part of the development of a cyber physical system and will be a physical system controlled by DCS (Distributed Control System) with data transmission over the network in real time. In this study, ITB Honeywell mini plant for laboratory scale is used for separating binary mixtures, ethanol and water. An on-off condenser valve is chosen as an actuator to regulate the end product concentration.The plant is modeled by 2 approaches, i.e. White-box modeling approach by first principle, which produces nonlinear equations model of batch distillation column based on component mass balance, vapor-liquid equilibrium and others physical characteristics. Meanwhile, the Black-box approach uses input-output experimental data to produce a linear model of the plant. The modelling is for two different locations of the concentration sensor, i.e. at the inflow or outflow of the end-product tank. The nonlinear model is not yet appropriate for control design purpose. Unlike the nonlinear model, the linear models developed at two different control inputs show marginal to good fit to the experimental data at respective operating points. However, it seems better to use a piecewise linear modelling over process operating regions for concentration control design purposes of the batch distillation column. Further development of the nonlinear model shall be done by considering the influence of temperature variability in the model. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - An accelerated aging test is an important test to assess a long time performance of an insulation system. This paper deals with the investigation results on thermally aged natural esters insulating liquid used for transformator. Two kinds of monoesters, palm fatty acid ester (PFAE) and stearic/oleic/linoleic acids methyl esters (M182), and one tri-ester, Envirotemp (FR3), were aged at the temperature of 120°C for 60 days. An as-received oil was used as a sample for aging test, so that the presence of a limited amount of air, and thus oxygen, in oil sample could not be avoided. The important properties like appearance, moisture content, acid value, volume resistivity, and breakdown voltage are evaluated at each 15 days interval. Experiment on mineral oil under the same condition was also conducted for comparison. It was observed that the color of the FR3 was changed from light-green to dark-green. PFAE, M182 and mineral oils which were initially transparent became yellow-green, light yellow and brown, respectively. A sludge formation was observed in the mineral oil, whereas the increase in acidity was found in the PFAE and M182 oils. The moisture content of aged PFAE and M182 oils decreased whereas that of aged FR3 and mineral oils increased. The volume resistivity of all tested oils decreased with aging time, whereas their breakdown voltage showed a different behaviours. The breakdown voltage of M182 and mineral oils increased and decreased, respectively, whereas that of PFAE and FR3 relatively unchanged. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Insulator is one of the most important equipments in an electric power system. Failure of insulator may interrupt the electric energy delivery. The system reliability is greatly affected by the performance of the insulator. Therefore, ensuring the high performance of insulators has become indispensable. There are many methods to increase the performance of the outdoor insulator that are exposed to environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and the presence of pollutants. Among the methods, applying room temperature vulcanized (RTV) silicone rubber coating and semiconducting glaze on the insulator surface are often used. This paper discusses the performance of uncoated ceramic insulator, RTV silicone rubber coated insulator, and semiconducting glazed insulator (SGI), as well as the comparison result among them. The performance is indicated by measuring leakage current (LC), surface temperature, and hydrophobicity. In addition, computer simulation on outdoor insulators using ATPDraw software is also conducted for LC waveform resulted by each type of insulator in order to study the electrical properties of each insulator. In the simulation, an outdoor insulator is represented by an electrical circuit model consisting of capacitors, nonlinear resistors, and number of arc models. AC voltage is applied to the model and the current is monitored. Hence, some key parameters of LC waveform are required to determine the similarity between measured LC waveform and simulated LC waveform, which are LC magnitude, Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), and dominant harmonic number. Experiment results showed that LC waveform and magnitude are strongly affected by the applied voltage, environmental condition, and the condition of the insulator surface itself. Specifically for SGI, LC waveforms are generally similar with the sinusoidal applied voltage. The LC waveforms are also symmetrical for positive and negative half cycles and no flashover was observed for applied voltage up to 40 kV. The hydrophobicity of insulator surface decreases after the experiments, with the pollutant presence and salt fog condition cause higher reduction compared to the clean samples and in clean fog environment. SGI has higher hydrophobicity compared to ceramic insulator. Field-aged RTV silicone rubber coated insulator shows higher hydrophobicity compared to field-aged uncoated ceramic insulator. At the end of the 6th year, the difference of contact angle between the two types of insulators can reach up to 50 – 60°. This proves that less pollutant is likely to stick on coated insulators for long time. The LC waveforms obtained from all experiments both in the laboratory or in the field have been successfully simulated through computer simulation. The simulation indicated that SGI is more capacitive than normal ceramic insulator and has lower values of piecewise resistance of the nonlinear resistance, resulting LC flow on the insulator surface also much higher. Despite the increased applied voltage, SGI shows very little discharge on its LC waveform, hence it has only 2 arc models, while at higher applied voltage, ceramic insulator has many discharges occur along the LC waveform, hence the arc models for this insulator can reach up to 9 arc models. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In this paper, magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles based nanofluid has been synthesized and characterized for application in oil filled transformers. The intent of this work is to check the feasibility of magnetite based nanofluid through appropriate characterizations. Magnetite nanoparticles have been synthesized by chemical co-precipitation method and the corresponding nanoparticles have been characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction, UV-Vis spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Further, ferrofluid has been characterized at different concentrations of nanoparticles those including 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% w/v % to report optimal concentration for improved dielectric and thermal performance of the nanofluid. Electrical measurements such as resistivity, permittivity and loss tangent at different concentrations of magnetite are reported. It is inferred that 20% concentration of magnetite is an optimal concentration with an improvement of 34% of BDV. Importantly, with the application of magnetite nanoparticles overall thermal and dielectric behavior of the insulation fluid will be improved while reducing the size and weight of the transformers. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper proposes an application of constriction factor based particle swarm optimization technique for solving the congestion management problem in transmission networks. Congestion management is one of the vital tasks performed by the power system engineers to ensure the operation of transmission network within operating limits. Nowadays, congestion management in electric power trade is extremely significant which can enforce a barrier to the electrical energy trade. The congestion management technique is based on optimal power flow which is proposed to relieve congestion in transmission lines. It’s been observed in the recent studies that alleviation of congestion in the transmission network is a serious problem in the power system operation. To maintain power system security by keeping all equipment in the system within the limit is the main objective of optimal power flow. The proposed constriction factor based particle swarm optimization combines the original particle swarm optimization algorithm with a constriction factor. It ensures convergence of particle swarm optimization algorithm to obtain optimal power flow solutions. The IEEE 30-bus system is tested by the proposed algorithm. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Multimodal biometric can overcome the limitations of the single biometric trait and gives better classification accuracy. This paper proposes a face-iris multimodal biometric system based on fusion at the matching score level. The iris recognition system is composed of segmentation, normalization, feature encoding and matching. The wavelet transform is used in feature extraction to generate a compact feature vector length of 128 bits; this reduces the computational time and storage of the iris code. The face recognition system is composed of enhancement, feature encoding and matching. The new method called ‘Phase-based Gabor Fisher Classifier (PBGFC)’ is used in feature extraction; PBGFC employs only 16 Gabor filters, i.e., filters with 2 scales and eight orientations. This fact makes the resulting feature vector for the PBGFC method very compact. The scores from iris and face are then combined using several score normalization and fusion techniques. To validate our approach, experiments are conducted on the iris and face images obtained from the CASIA and ORL datasets respectively. The results show that our multimodal biometric system achieves higher accuracy than both single biometric approaches and the other existing multi-biometric systems based on fusion of iris and face. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Wind energy conversion systems are the quickest developing renewable source of electrical energy having tremendous environmental and social advantages. In this paper proposed an optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) technique of wind power plants in grid connected power system. The ORPD issue is a vital issue in the operation of power frameworks. It is a nonlinear and mixed integer programming issue, which decides ideal qualities for control parameters of reactive power makers to upgrade particular target capacities while fulfilling a few specialized requirements. The ORPD technique consists of ACO and ANFIS controller for improving the performance of multiple wind turbines and the steady state stability of the power system in terms of active and reactive power flow of a transmission line. The ACO algorithm is used to extract the maximum power from WECS. The generated maximum power is transmitted through the UPFC connected HVDC link. The performance of the UPFC is improved with the ANFIS controller based on the actual and the reference power parameters of the grid connected power system. Furthermore, UPFC is utilized to control active and reactive flow of power in a transmission line. The proposed method is implemented in MATLAB/Simulink platform and tested with the different wind speed condition. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, the obtained results in the deterministic case is compared with the existing methods like GA and PSO. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Medical images are too fuzzy for discrete boundaries. This paper describes a fuzzy rule based seed point optimization in K-mean clustering method with a application in image segmentation. Prior information about the subject helps to elongate the cluster class and able to identify the target seed point smoothly for the detection of renal calculi oftenly called as a kidney stone. Kidney is a source organ for urology disorder which can be protected by efficient kidney stone detection technique in ultrasound images. Proposed method of clustering reduces the number of iterations for elobrating the region of interest in entitled images. This approach promising to give a more accurate solution for ultrasound images and it also enhances the image retrieval as compared to classical clustering methods. The experimental results justify the effectiveness of proposed approach by reducing the computational time without effecting the segmentation quality which can be validated by peak signal to noise ratio value. Results are validated on 150 Ultrasound image samples having six classes of renal calculi. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of embedded devices attaching sensor and microelectronic technology, computational capability, and distributed processing. Due to computing capability, it is interesting to implement in-network processing in WSN. It means that data preprocessing is conducted in network to reduce amount of data and processing time in server. One of in-network processing approach is multiagent-based signal processing. Here, Agents deployed in sensor nodes, including mobile agents, make collaboration for data aggregation and preprocessing. This paper describes our proposed method how multiagent system is implemented in real WSN. The method lists the process how global network information is identified by agents in sensor nodes, mobile agent migration plan is conducted by the intelligent agent in head clusters, and the mobile agent migrates hop by hop and performs collaboration with sensor node agents for data preprocessing. We propose vibration of a concrete beam as the case study. Our simulation and experimental results show that the proposed multiagent system works properly. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - At the moment, there are two main methods of solving the compressive sensing (CS) reconstruction problem which are the convex optimization and the greedy algorithm. Convex optimization has good reconstruction stability but very slow in computation. Greedy algorithm, on the other hand, is very fast but less stable. A fast and stable CS reconstruction algorithm is necessary for a better provision of CS in practical application. In this paper we proposed a CS reconstruction algorithm using L1-norm minimization via L2-norm minimization. This method is based on geometrical interpretation of L1-norm minimization of the reconstruction problem and the fact that the Euclidean distance between L1-norm and L2-norm solution lie closely. In other word, if L2-norm solution is found, then direction to the L1-norm solution is on the shortest path connecting them. This approach offers a simpler computation. Computer simulation showed that proposed algorithm has better stability than the greedy algorithm and faster computation than the convex optimization. The proposed algorithm thus provides an alternative solution for CS reconstruction problem when a balance between speed and stability is required. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - A paradigm for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel modeling demands diversity technique to compensate the effects of fading and shadowing. In this paper, error performance of MIMO system is analyzed with orthogonal space time block code (OSTBC) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) techniques over Weibull-gamma (WG) fading channel. WG distribution forms a composite channel model which is used to determine the effects of multipath as well as shadowing. In this scenario, exact analytical expressions for symbol error rate (SER) are computed for MIMO systems using OSTBC and MRC. Consequently, the effects of fading severity by varying shape parameters are also shown by simulation and analytical results. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Electrical drives are more and more used in transportation applications and industrial process because of their effective cost and high efficiency. They have become critical components and therefore any fault or failure affecting them may seriously endanger the users and/or induce huge financial costs. As a consequence, early detection and isolation of these faults is recommended if not mandatory to enhance the safety, the availability, the reliability and improve the maintenance and the operational efficiency. Analytical Redundancy Relations (ARR) are used to compute to structured residuals on which the diagnosis is based. To smooth the residuals and enhance the fault detection capability, a sliding mode observer is developed to compute the derivatives. The analysis of the residuals reveals that they are Gaussian signals with a change in the mean. The comparison between the two-sigma and the two-sided CUSUM methods has shown that the latter is more efficient to compute the thresholds. Therefore with the two-sided CUSUM, the rotor resistance fault is detected with no false alarm. Moreover it is proved that the fault diagnosis is robust to the load torque variations. Beside, thanks to the residual, a load torque estimator is also developed. Extensive simulation results prove the validity of our approach. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper the effect of demand side management (DSM) on the sizing of hybrid PV/wind/battery energy in system has been considered. The pigeon inspired algorithm (PIO) has been used for optimization purpose and additionally an energy filter algorithm has been developed to minimize the fluctuations of power injected into the grid. The levelized cost of energy (LCE) has been taken as the objective function while maintaining the system reliability, healthy charge on the battery as well as the less fluctuations in the power injected into the grid. The simulation has been performed for both actual load and modified load after the DSM has been performed. To verify the results a case study has been considered and the simulations are carried out in MATLAB environment. The results indicate that the DSM considerably reduces the storage requirements and there by reducing the unit cost. © 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - A fuzzy logic based technique using dissolved gas analysis to determine the health index of the oil in a power transformer is proposed in the present paper. The proposed fuzzy model integrates the DGA standards and the practical knowledge of transformer diagnostics experts in making a consistent decision on the health condition of the transformer oil. Twenty different transformer oil samples of a power utility validate the reliability of the proposed diagnostic models. Furthermore, a fuzzy logic based overall transformer health assessment model has been proposed in this paper. This model uses several diagnostic tests data of transformers including water content, break down voltage, interfacial tension. It is envisioned that the proposed fuzzy models will prove very convenient even for inexperienced engineers to determine the health index of the transformers. This shall help in initiating suitable action for proper maintenance of the transformers and enhancing their remnant life. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Small signal stability is one of the factor to assesst the reliability of a power system. Small signal stability is related to the ability of a power system to maintain synchronization after being exposed by small disturbance. In Indonesia, the reliability of power system is one of the important aspect that has to be achieved. However, very scant attention has been paid on studied small signal stability performance on Indonesia electricity. Hence, this paper studied the small signal stability analysis and its enhancement. 150 kV Sulselrabar interconnected power system is used as test system. To enhance the performance of the system designing coordinated controller of power system stabilizer (PSS) and redox flow batteries (RFB) using cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) is conducted. Eigenvalue, damping ratio, participation factor analysis, and time domain simulation is performed to assess the small signal stability performance and the successfulness of the CSA to optimize the PSS and RFB parameter. From the cases studies, it is found that 150 kV Sulselrabar has 12 local mode and 4 inter-area mode. Furthermore, the coordinated controller between PSS and RFB based on CSA could enhance the small signal stability performance of 150 kV Sulselrabar interconnected system indicated by higher damping, smallest overshoot and fastest settling time. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Solar based renewable power generation is more important to compensate fossil fuel power generation. It is necessary to implement Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) system to reduce cost of PV array system by decreasing the number of solar panel required to generate the power. Since the solar power fluctuates with the sunlight’s intensity, it requires conversion to maintain the desired voltage like inverters. In this paper, a series compensation scheme is suggested. Perturbation and observation (P&O) algorithm of MPPT. A single stage architecture of photovoltaic generators which is used for residential applications are incapable to boost the voltage of the PV modules and also provides deficient input voltage range in spite of providing deplete power loss. This research work proposes a series connection of buck-boost converter which operates only in buck mode and also processes a fraction of the power input from the inverter while operating at high efficiency. This inverter focused SPWM pulses and produces pure sine wave as output. The duty ratio is decreased to less than 0.5 hence switching losses also reduced. The proposed logic is carried out in simulation and hardware setup of 480W prototype and the results were analyzed to enhance the advantage of the series compensation approach. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Extensive research on single-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) over the past decade has provided good estimation results in mapping small environment. This raises the idea for building a larger map by using some robots that are assembled within the team, also called multi-robot SLAM. There are two types of multi-robot SLAM, that is, centralized and distributed multi-robot SLAM. Centralized multi-robot SLAM method still has problems in case of system failure on some robots, especially the system failure on the robot central. Distributed multi-robot SLAM was developed to overcome the weaknesses in centralized multi-robot SLAM by: 1) building a map of larger environment by fusing local maps from a group of robots, 2) eliminating the dependence on central processing by using distributed computing, 3) overcoming the vulnerability in case of system failure in some robots, especially the system failure in the robot central, and 4) eliminating centralized communication, in which each robot requires only local communication with its neighboring robots. However, the distributed multi-robot SLAM method has not yielded good results on map estimates and localization estimates. This paper proposes consensus-based distributed multi-robot SLAM method that can be applied to map common environments. We use FastSLAM algorithm as the main base in developing distributed multi-robot SLAM. We suggest using one of two selection of consensus parameters, that is, particle weight and posterior parameter. We assume that each robot has the same motion model and observation model; therefore, the system noise and observation noise is the same. The aim of this paper is to design consensus based distributed multi-robot SLAM method that provides better map estimation and localization results when applied to common environments. We concentrate to test the proposed methods on aspects: 1) root mean square error (RMSE) of map to see the map estimation performance, 2) RMSE of localization to see the robot’s pose estimation performance, 3) mapping coverage to see how long it will take until all features are observed, and 4) processing time to see how long the computation process takes place per timestep. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - An auction based bid learning process for cognitive radio networks, where the users and the service providers are learning about each other to maximise each other’s utility is examined. A game model is formulated to allow players to learn depending on their priority. This enables users to learn different parameters such as the best offered bid price and the appropriate time to participate in the auction process. The performance of the system is examined based on the developed utility function. The results show that the blocking probability, utility function and the energy consumed is better with the learning users when compared to the non-learning process. Results also show that provided learning is taking place in the system, Nash Equilibrium can be established. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper deals radial distribution system power losses allocation to connected consumers before and after distribution generator (DG) in a deregulated environment. Allocation of power loss is made in a proposed exact method way, which is calculated based on allocating power losses to consumers by taking each branch current suppling to customer load from substation to customer load. Proposes a new methodology to reduce the burden of loss allocation to customers by allocating the optimal DG size at best location. The best location derive based on highest value line of power stability index (PSI) and increase in small steps of DG values in best location obtain the optimal DG size at the best location. The impact of DG on voltage profile, system losses and customer losses allocation are visualized by an analytical approach. The robustness and scalability of proposed method is tested on 12 bus and 69-bus radial distribution networks and compared with the existing Golden Section Search (GSS) algorithm. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Recently, the use of smart cards in human life is increasing. One important aspect in implementing smart cards in human life is its security. Security should be considered because smart cards can contain important data that must be protected, and specific research is needed to address attacks against smart card. There are weaknesses in preserving forward anonymity on dynamic ID-based remote user authentication using smart cards as mentioned in Zhai et al. In their work, attacks that led to the failure of forward anonymity have been successfully carried out. This problem has already been overcome by Lee’s scheme, with the probability of the forward anonymity failure was ½296 but the computation cost was still high. This research discussed about overcoming attacks that can lead to the failure of forward anonymity with probability of less than ½296 and has less computation cost. For this purpose, discrete log function and multiplicative inverse is introduced instead of using hash function and Diffie-Hellman method. Based on the discussion it is proven that these functions can preserve the forward anonymity with the probability of failure less than ½296. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Selecting an efficient route and profitable fish aggregating device (FAD) position has become a significant matter for fishermen due to fuel limitations and environmental conditions. Certain efforts have been offered to determine the best FAD route by means of optimization methods. The firefly algorithm (FA) is one optimization method that has recently been developed and implemented. Furthermore, the genetic algorithm (GA) has been applied in many cases, including maritime. The objective of this study is to analyze the route optimization and to determine a profitable FAP based on FA and GA approaches. Simulations involving gamma value as the attractiveness variation and alpha as the randomness movements of fishing vessels are conducted. Their time complexity is computed to evaluate both performances. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is also calculated in order to obtain the accuracy of forecasting/predicting the route to FAD position. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Monitoring energy consumption and diagnosing abnormal behavior will enable utilities to introduce strategies to improve system resiliency, stability, and to meet energy efficiency targets. The deployment of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) enables utilities to collect various raw data from its customers and networks. This paper presents contextual anomaly detection algorithm to detect irregular power consumption and visualize anomaly scores using unsupervised learning algorithm and temporal context generated from meter readings. The proposed algorithm computes an anomaly score for each user by considering historical consumption data. The anomaly score for a user is then adjusted by analyzing other contextual variables such as seasonal variation day of the week and other users with the same historical pattern. The implementation of real-world data set provided by power utility company shows a high performance of the proposed algorithm. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The major objective of any electric distribution system (DS) operators in the present competitive market is to increase the service quality with improved reliability and lesser energy cost. This objective can be achieved by maintaining the balance between the reliability and cost of investments. In this work, system reliability is improved by using reserve capacity considering load growth. A sequential load growth model is presented for addition of load in non-integer years which is essential for sequential Monte Carlo simulation method. A model is presented to estimate the required reserve capacity if planning duration is known and vice versa. The concept of minimum allowable reserve capacity (MARC) is introduced to overcome the risk due to uncertain load growth. The system reserve capacity is increased by two ways i.e. up-gradation of distribution substation and integration of distributed generation (DG). The impact of load growth rate and reserve capacity level on system reliability is evaluated for a practical Indian distribution system. The required reserve capacity levels and capacity expansion duration are evaluated for different load growth rates and MARC values. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - SDIV of OIP material gets altered with thermal ageing temperature of OIP material, supply voltage frequency and the harmonic content in the supply voltage. The UHF signal radiated due to surface discharges formed under AC voltage, high frequency AC voltages and with harmonic voltages, have dominant frequency at about 0.9 GHz. Surface charge accumulation studies indicate that thermal ageing have high impact on amount of charge accumulation. Also number of layers of insulation have high charge trap density, which is ascertained through tdv/dt plot. The amount of charge accumulated is high with pressboard impregnated in titania nanoparticle dispersed transformer oil. The SD activity occurs at the rising portion of AC voltage and at high dv/dt’s with harmonic AC voltages. More number of discharges occur with OIPs thermally aged at higher temperature. Physico-chemical changes clearly indicate not much of a change occurs with transformer insulation due to thermal ageing. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, the two topologies of Distribution Static Compensator (DSTATCOM) such as conventional DSTATCOM and modified DSTATCOM with their performances are investigated in terms of power quality improvement. Normally the DSTATCOM has shunt voltage source inverter (VSI) connected to point of common coupling (PCC) through the interfacing inductor. It is possible to modify DSTATCOM by connecting a capacitor in series with the interface inductor at the point of common coupling. This Modified topology requires a lower value of dc link voltage across the dc storage capacitor of voltage source inverter (VSI) for compensation of source currents, when compared with the conventional DSTATCOM topology. The reference signal for PWM generator is generated using synchronous reference frame theory and Indirect PI theory. A detailed simulation study to compare the performances of conventional and modified topologies are carried out using MATLAB 7.1 and the superior features of modified DSTATCOM topology are established. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The study of propagation characteristics is a fundamental step in mobile radio engineering; which is intended to achieve maximum performance for a mobile radio system. To do this, the propagation models are essential tools for this study such as the evaluation of the signal strength received by a mobile terminal, the evaluation of coverage radii and deduce the number of cells needed to cover a given area, such as radio planning, which in turn is the step that aims to estimate the necessary equipment and configurations of the radio interface. In this work we adopt the standard K factor model and OKUMURA HATA model to demonstrate a propagation model adapted to the physical environment of the city of Annaba in Algeria using a linear regression algorithm based on the ordinary least squares method. Radio measurements were carried out on the CDMA network of operator Mobilis. The calculation of the square root of the mean square error between the actual data and the radio measurements and the prediction data derived from the model implemented allowing the validation of the results obtained. A comparative study between the value of the RMSE obtained by the new model and those obtained by the models K standard factors and the model of OKUMURA HATA allows us to conclude that the new model is better adapted to our local environment than that of OKUMURA HATA. The new model obtained can help increase the performance of mobile radio systems deployed in our territory. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - The newest model was proposed to extract the characteristic as distinctive attribute based on the Simplification of the Laplacian Smoothing Transform (S-LST) and the Fisherface. The proposed model is composed of two primary processes, i.e., training and testing processes. A training process involved features extraction based on the S-LST and the Fisherface, selection of the principal features, and features fusion of them. The proposed model has proved that the features can preserve the particular global information and the local feature areas of the rows and columns. The testing process is the stage to obtain the primary features through the new projection of the training sets. The last operation of the testing process is to measure the similarity of the features. The proposed model was tested using three different databases, i.e., the ORL, the YALE, and the UoB. The proposed model demonstrated the best performance, which is 100% recognition rate on the ORL and YALE when five images are implemented to the training sets. The maximum average of the recognition rate is 98.7% for the ORL database, 97.7% for the YALE database, and 94.53% for the UoB database. The comparison result showed that the proposed model performs better than the other approach, i.e., LST+LDA, S-MFA, S-NPE, S-LPP, S-LDA, LPP, LDA, and PCA. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Lightning caused interruptions by shielding failures or by back-flashover. Lightning over voltages cannot be avoided but their influence can be limited by appropriate over voltage protection. In this paper, Characteristics and hazards of lightning overvoltage in the Egyptian Bassous-Cairo West 500-kV transmission line single circuit are analyzed and discussed. Some effective factors, which affecting generated lightning back-flashover across the insulator of a transmission system are analyzed. These factors are included magnitude of lightning stroke, front and tail times of lightning stroke impulse, and chopped current. The influence of connecting Substations Surge Arrester SSA and Line Surge Arrester LSA are investigated. This paper also provides a procedure to limit lightning flashover and back-flashover. ATP-EMTP simulation program is applied to analyze the lightning over-voltage of power line. The result show that there is a 100% probability of an insulator flashover in case high peak, short front time, and any tail time of lightning strokes without any installed arrester. LSA prevent insulator flashover than back flash over. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding images by recognizing its objects is still a challenging task. Tracking of moving human and recognition have been developed by researchers but not yet shows enough information needed for recognition. Initially, a tracking process of an object starts with detection and recognition of the object in a static pose and position, and then continues in movement in different poses. Available moving human recognition methods still has error in classification and need a huge amount of examples which may still be incomplete. Human face and body posture characteristics such as size of the eyes, nose, mouth, or fat or thin bodies, are important visual features in different poses for personal identification to increase accuracy of human recognition system, and it is still rare in researches. This paper attempts to describe visual features that best known for human, but hard to be recognized by machines. Curve fitting approaches to face and body posture features are also introduced to capture exact patterns of the features. Body postures are also preprocessed with a Kinect depth camera, and also compared to popular and recent methods of visual object recognition. Finally, we demonstrate our method can be useful for visual object classification. Probabilities of personal identification can be increased by using different poses and characteristics of smaller detail features through body postures and face areas. More detail features will richen comparison data samples for higher recognition accuracy. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the recent years,Wavelet transform has been proved to be a very useful tool for image processing. Modified fast haar wavelet transform (MFHWT) is one of the approach which reduces the calculation work in haar transform (HT) and fast haar transform (FHT). In the present communication, we applied modified fast haar wavelet on an input image to yields a highly reduced dimension representation. In this way, the number of image blocks of an image can be drastically reduced which improves the time efficiency of subsequent lexicographical sorting and similarity matching. This reduced dimension representation is split into fixed-size overlapping blocks and then ring projection transform is performed to each block for extract their features into a row vector. These extracted feature vectors are arranged in a matrix. Then, the feature vectors are sorted by a lexicographical order so that similar blocks would be consecutive. Finally, the duplicated blocks are filtered out by calculating the similarity value of correlation coefficient between two adjacent blocks. Obtained results show the performance of proposed algorithm, which is able to detect forgery with less computational time and also reduced dimension drastically as well as memory needed for the detection process of copy move image forgery. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper discusses the difference between the three fundamental types of multilevel inverter (MLI) topologies, which are the neutral-point-clamped, the flying capacitors and the cascaded H-bridges. The sinusoidal pulse width modulation technique was used to simulate the output voltages and currents of the MLI inverters. The total harmonic distortion (THD) was estimated for each topology and each voltage level. Moreover, the simulation results indicate that the cascaded structure exhibited a lower THD value even when increasing the number of the output voltage. Furthermore, a new key parameter was defined as cost efficiency factor and used to compare the three topologies. Evaluation results of this factor indicate that the cascaded structure was the most advantages as it reduces stress effect on the inverter switches by eliminating the power diodes and capacitors. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - An effective allocation of the reactive power in an electrical network aims generally to improve the voltage profile and to control transmission power losses. The present paper proposes the application of an efficient hybrid method combining two evolutionary search techniques. The technique is based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) to solve the Optimal Reactive Power Planning (ORPP) problem for energy losses cost minimization of Algerian electric power system using the static Var Compensator devices (SVC). To ensure viability of the power system in contingency cases, various critical situations are simulated in order to prevent and prepare the power system to face such situations. The proposed program handles most changes that can occur in to the power system (heavy load, losing a large generator, losing a critical line …etc.). The proposed method is applied to solve the ORPP problem on the equivalent Algerian electric power system 114- bus. Moreover, the obtained results are compared, with PSO and GSA, separately. The results obtained by the proposed method show it’s effectiveness for improving the reactive power planning problem. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Linear Induction motors (LIM) are widely used in industrial applications, especially in linear motion locomotive systems. These applications require high efficiency with good power factor. Mostly LIM suffer from low power factor and less efficiency. Due to this energy consumption is high and also it draws more input current. In this paper, a novel multi objective Taguchi algorithm (TA) is proposed to meet required efficiency and power factor in the design of a Linear Induction Motor. Hence, LIM dimensions can then be optimized by using a TA in an appropriate objective functions. 2- D Finite Element Method is adopted to analyze the flux density in LIM with the parameters obtained using TA. From the results it is observed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the Genetic algorithm (GA) and Particle swarm optimization (PSO) with respect to the power factor and efficiency. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In spite of its usefulness to early detect cardiovascular disease, photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals are prone to motion artifacts due to its typical measurement locations. These artifacts consequently affect the reliability of systolic peak detection-based PPG parameter calculations. In this paper, the PPG signals are modeled by a small number (3 to 6) of Amplitude-Frequency Modulation (AM-FM) modulated signals such that the synthesis signal preserves its harmonics structure in time-frequency domain. We propose a coherent AM modulating signal detection by which the filterbank tracks Instantaneous Frequency (IF) of each harmonic component. This time-varying filterbank method offers bandwidth preservation of the AM components. Furthermore, the experimental results show that motion artifact (MA) noise reference for the input of the adaptive filter is generated from the corrupted PPG signal itself by using one of applications of our method © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Flexibility of Internet technology gives rise to concern about the protection of digital data. Digital audio watermarking is the art of hiding important data in Digital Audio. This research paper deals with a new methodology which helps to enhance the robustness of Digital Audio Watermarking technique based on Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and singular value decomposition (SVD). In this approach, multiple watermarks (Image -64 X 64 pixels and text) are embedded into the approximate coefficients of Discrete Wavelet Transform of an audio signal. Haar wavelet is used for decomposition while SVD is applied to get the Eigen values of approximate coefficients of audio signal. Experimental work demonstrate that watermarked audio has same perceptual quality as that of original one. The performance of the proposed work is evaluated with the help of objective measures such as Signal to Noise ratio, Peak signal to Noise ratio, Bit error rate, Normalized Cross correlation, etc. Additionally, simulation results on audio signals prove that the capacity of the proposed scheme is considerably better in comparison with the existing watermarking methods. Furthermore, the proposed work is applied for different audio signals such as classical, instrumental, flute, pop & rock to check the robustness against various attacks. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - A new variable switching frequency is proposed to reduce the output current ripple of single-phase PWM inverters. This proposed method will keep the peak-to-peak output current ripple constant, instead of varying as the function of current angle in the conventional constant switching frequency operation. By keeping the constant peak-to-peak current ripple, the output current ripple can be reduced without sacrificing the efficiency. Analytical expression for the optimum switching frequency variation is derived. Experiment results are included to show and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Within the framework of the diagnosis of the stator windings faults, the authors propose in this paper a recursive diagnosis method for on-line detection and location of an inter-turn short-circuit by parameters identification. This approach based on the Recursive Levenberg-Marquardt (RLM) algorithm is used for the minimization of the objective function represented by the quadratic criterion obtained by the difference between the real outputs and their estimations. Tests and validations of failure detection by parameter identification require a model suited for fault modelling. For this purpose, a faulty induction motor model is proposed. Electric parameters of this model as well as fault parameters are estimated by RLM adaptive algorithm through an output-error technique. Because the parameters values of this model present magnitude order very different, the normalization of these parameters is proposed in order to obtain the sensitivity functions with the same magnitude order. The estimation results, which used simulated data, are presented to show the effectiveness and the advantage of the proposed approach for use in real-time stator faults diagnosis. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In the last mile of telecommunication network technology, optical transmission network has been deployed using the Fiber-to-the Home (FTTH) technology to provide broadband user demands. Evolution of the FTTH network change very rapidly, causing an implementation of existing and new technology should be in coexistence or called in hybrid mode. Optical distribution networks consist of more than 60% of the total investments in deploying Passive Optical Networks (PON). So, it is essential for the evolution of PON to cooperation with the existing networks. This paper discusses compatible hybrid application of the Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) and the 10-Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network (XGPON) for splitting ratio of 1:64. The performance of the hybrid network system is analyzed using The Opti-system software tool. The transmitter, the receiver and the transmission channel are set in compliance to the ITU-T standards series G.984. A laser component with NRZ modulation scheme and the transmitter power is adjusted to maximum power. The fiber optic cable uses the Single Mode Fiber (SMF) and the bit rate used in the GPON is 2.5 Gbps downstream and 1.25 Gbps upstream, while on the XGPON the bit rate are 10 Gbps downstream and 2.5 Gbps upstream. The result of experiment by simulation shows that the performance of hybrid GPON and XGPON technology for 1:64 splitting ratio is suitable to be implemented in FTTH to provide broadband services. It means that the migration from GPON to XGPON can be done smoothly via hybrid mode to keep safe existing investment of Telco operators. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper presents a synchronized phasor measurement-based wide-area backup protection scheme which uses the magnitude of sequence voltages of buses at a system protection centre to identify the faulted bus closest to the fault and faulted line. The technique is tested for various faults including simultaneous faults in various systems with interconnections. The scheme is found to be accurate and fast with today’s synchronized measurement technology. Analysis using simultaneous faults is a novel contribution in this paper. It is expected that this scheme will reduce the number of disastrous blackouts and improve the reliability and security of the power system. The required information is able to distinguish between balanced and unbalanced fault in the system. The study of new back up protection scheme is done on a WSCC-3 machine-9 bus system and an IEEE 14 bus test system. The data is simulated through EMTDC/PSCAD and MATLAB /SIMULINK softwares. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - For past several decades research in the field of photovoltaic has progressed from first generation solar cell to third generation solar cell. The dominance of solid state device which converts photons to electrons is a new challenge in technologies. In this work, a high efficient Dye Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC) is fabricated. DSSC is easy to fabricate solar cell among the conventional pn-junction photo voltaic solar cells and even it is eco-friendly. A typical DSSC suffers from semiconductor liquid junctions and therefore concerns of electrolyte volatility and breakdown persists. By optimizing the sintering time, temperature, proper choosing of different types of sensitizer/dyes and the electrolyte, improves the efficiency of DSSC. It focuses towards developing DSSC on a small scale with the glass plates as electrodes coated with Titanium Oxide (TiO2) and graphite. The plates are conducting which are coated with Fluorine doped Tin Oxide (FTO). To enhance the absorption power of the glass plates Eosin blue is chosen as a dye. These electrodes are placed in an electrolyte made up of Lithium Iodide (LiI) and Iodine (I). The electrical conduction mechanism of the fabricated DSSC is studied at 50 lux and also tested with cascaded series cell connection. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - To improve the dynamic stability of power systems, by increasing the damping torque of the synchronous machine, it is necessary to use the power system stabilizers to enhance the damping during low frequency oscillations. In this article, an attempt has been made to design the parameters of power system stabilizer by using the Firefly Algorithm applied to the single machine infinite bus system to an amenable form. The stability enhancement has been compared with Genetic Algorithm stabilizer for different operating conditions. The results show that the designed power system stabilizer based on Firefly Algorithm gives a good dynamic response when compared to Genetic Algorithm power system stabilizer. The Pseudo Spectrum analysis is also presented which is evident about the enhanced stability of the system with the proposed Algorithm. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper presents a comparison between Sensor or Indirect Field Oriented Control (IFOC) and Sensor-less Field Oriented Control (SFOC) in low frequency region for Induction Motor (IM). These two strategies can be considered among the family of Vector Control (VC) methods and provide a solution for high-performance drives. Most of the Electrically-operated Overhead Travelling (EOT) Crane IMs are controlled with vector control techniques. IM performance will deteriorate as frequency falls below 5 Hz due to its stator resistance drop. There are some critical requirements which needs rocket segments and satellite needs to be positioned in very precise position. For this EOT crane has to run in creep speed which needs drive has to run below 5 Hz. In this paper, the analysis is carried out on IFOC and SFOC methods and implemented to IM drives. In IFOC, flux magnitude and angle is achieved by imposing a slip frequency derived from the rotor dynamic equations with monitored rotor speed using external sensor such as encoder. Whereas SFOC does not require any sensor for estimation of flux magnitude and position, with monitored stator voltages and stator currents, flux magnitude and position can be achieved. Advantages and disadvantages of two control methods are emphasized in low frequency region (0-5 Hz). The theoretical results are found to be consistent with experimental results performed on 100 HP, three phase IM. It is concluded that IFOC method is better than SFOC method in low frequency region. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Most trajectory pattern mining techniques assume that the data to be analyzed contain complete and evenly distributed spatial and temporal information. However in reality, collected data may contain noise, missing or incomplete information, and uneven spatial resolution. In trajectory pattern mining methods, trajectory patterns are extracted by splitting spatial workspace into uniformly tiny sized squares, followed by determining popular cells which contain many data points. Finally, a sequential pattern mining technique, e.g. MiSTA, is used to extract trajectory pattern. This research proposes non-uniform partitioning to handle uneven spatial distribution as modification towards the uniform spatial workspace division process. The proposed approach, named multistage spatial partitioning is developed based on point-region quadtree concept. The new partitioning method is conducted for preprocessing before applying MiSTA. As the result, using multistage spatial partition, MiSTA succeeds in uncovering more detailed and broader coverage patterns compared to uniform partitioning approach through a series of experiments. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Positive lightning can do more damage than negative lightning. We have observed 77 positive cloud to ground (CG) flashes preceded by preliminary breakdown (PB) in Padang, Indonesia. It was found that there were two types of polarity between the PB pulse train and the following first return stroke (RS) pulses, namely the same polarity (type S) and composite polarity (type C). The occurence percentages of type S and type C were 92.2% and 7.8%, respectively. The aritmathic mean (AM) and geometric mean (GM) PB/RS separations and durations were 97.31 ms, 76.33 ms and 98.15 ms, 77.49 ms, respectively. The AM and GM PB/RS ratios were 12.26% and 10.20%, respectively. In addition, the characteristics of the PB pulse such as individual pulse duration, pulse train duration, and interpulse duration are discussed in this paper. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The possibility of creating of modifications of high-phase asynchronous motors based on standard three-phase ones is justified. The authors considered a number of power circuits of controlled electrical drives in which high-phase power supply of induction motors is provided. The drives operation to certain by value and nature the load as well as the given adjustment range is analyzed. As a result of mathematical modeling it is determined that the overheating temperatures of stator windings of considered high-phase motors do not exceed the permissible values corresponding the heat resistance insulation class. Comparison of technical and economic parameters of the considered circuits and motors making it possible to realize an acceptable determination of options depending on reasonable selection criterion is carried out. The regularities of changes of the phase currents of high-phase motors in the adjustment range are determined. The change in the vibro-acoustic characteristics in static and dynamic modes is investigated. Reduction of these indicators in motors with the number of phases greater than three is determined. The authors considered a number of circuits of adjustable electric drives in which two-block rectifiers and high-phase induction motors are used. Automated optimal design of adjustable six-phase induction motors for three project tasks is carried out. Through parametric optimization acceptable values of variable parameters in two design criteria are found. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hydro-turbine and governor parameters affect power system stability. It is essential to identify the parameters of the hydraulic system, turbine, and governor to improve the power-system stability. In this study, we carry out the identification of parameters using popular linear analysis techniques using SIMPOW software. The grid-connected power system Tala Hydropower Station is considered for the study. We identify how the parameters of the hydraulic system, turbine, and governor affect the power-system stability. The governor parameters such as permanent droop, temporary droop, filter time constant and servo time constant affect the stability of the grid-connected system. The parameters of the hydraulic system are surge impedance, friction factor of penstock, penstock elastic time constant, partial derivative of flow with respect to head, partial derivative of mechanical torque with respect to head, partial derivative of mechanical torque with respect to gate opening and partial derivative of flow with respect to gate opening affect the grid connected system. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The Unified Power Quality Conditioner (UPQC) has the capability of improving power quality in the industrial distribution systems. It is a combination of shunt and series active power filters, both joined together by a common Direct current (DC) bus. The major issue when utilizing the UPQC is the determination of the optimal parameters. The traditional method used to determine the optimal parameters of the UPQC is a daunting task, because the system requires greater computational and simulation efforts. This paper proposes a faster approach using the concept of a Membership Function (MF) in which a Weight Factor (WF) is utilized. In the proposed technique, a range of values is specified for each parameter of the filters. These values are used to design a membership function for each parameter, and the choice of the optimal parameter is extracted by the aid of a WF. In this study, the effectiveness of the UPQC was tested at various system conditions to verify the performance of the proposed technique. The presented results show that the obtained parameters of UPQC using the proposed technique can provide fast dynamic response. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper presents an efficient and reliable new teaching based optimization algorithm for solving scheduling of hydro-thermal systems with cascaded reservoirs. Unlike the Teaching Learning Based Optimization, the Double Teaching Optimization (DTO) algorithm has two teaching phases i.e. the first teaching phase is identical with conventional TLBO algorithm preserving the inherent basics of it. The second teaching phase is the modified part considering students once again interact with the same teacher, who is the better than average students called double teaching phase. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated in five different cases of two standard test systems consisting of four cascaded hydro and thermal units. The findings of the proposed method are better than the results of other established methods reported in literature in terms of quality of solution and convergence characteristics. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - We design a device for helping a blind person. By using this device, the blind doesn’t need to use stick or dog for helping him or her. The device will help the blind person for figuring the obstacle in front of him or her. We use microcontroller, an ultrasonic sensor as an input, and an electromechanical buzzer as an output. The device is proved accurate when we tried it for the distance 150 centimeters, 100 centimeters, and 50 centimeters between the user and the object. © 2017, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In this paper, the designing problem of two flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS)-based stabilizers are formulated for a cuckoo optimization algorithm (COA) with an objective function that includes the damping factor and the damping ratio of oscillations. This new optimization algorithm has a strong ability to find the most optimistic results for dynamic stability improvement. Also, its performance in 20 times run is the same as in 1 time run. Single machine infinite bus (SMIB) system has been considered to examine the operation of proposed COA based static synchronous series compensator (SSSC) and static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) controllers. Sudden change in the input power of generator is considered as a disturbance. The effectiveness of the proposed COA based SSSC and STATCOM controller for damping of low frequency oscillations is tested on a weakly connected power system with a disturbance and different loading conditions and their results are compared with each other. The eigenvalue analysis and time domain simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of these FACTS-based stabilizers. The results obtained revealed the effectiveness of SSSC in comparison with STATCOM in damping power system oscillation and the results confirmed the effectiveness of the COA method for controller parameter optimization. © 2016 School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Two Voltage followers (VF) suited to low-voltage operation and able to operate with a high-slew rate and low-output impedance are presented. The buffer core is based on the flipped voltage follower (FVF) which is previously presented in literature. A detailed comparison of proposed buffers and other voltage followers is presented. These buffers have been simulated using 0.18 µm CMOS technology models provided by TSMC. The buffers consume 10 µA from 1.2 V supply and have a power consumption of 25 µw. The first and second proposed buffers have slew rate of 13 V/µs and 32 V/µs, respectively, with output impedance of about 50 Ω. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - A cognitive radio is only able to set up communication using unused frequencies or vacant channels. Spectrum sensing is mandatory task for cognitive radio to detect the vacant channels. The detection faces some challenges due to the required performance and limited knowledge on the primary signals. A blind spectrum sensing which can work without the knowledge of the primary signal is preferable. In this paper we propose a blind spectrum sensing method for cognitive radio network. The proposed method based on the difference on distribution of the condition between when the transmission from primary user is active and when it's inactive. If it is inactive, the received signal will contain only noise which is Gaussian. It is different from the distribution of signal which is contaminated with noise. A normality test using the Jarque-Bera test statistic is used for the detection of the event. The target of the analysis is both the real and the imaginary parts of FFT's output. The proposed algorithm was tested to detect the DTV signal. Results show that our method is performed better than previous similar method. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Pulse radar is a device for emitting short pulse with high power and receiving echo signal from the target. At receiver side, pulse radar has an Automatic Gain Control (AGC) module to adjust receiver sensitivity and get the best amplitude level for the next process. The AGC type used in this research is HMC992LP5E. In previous research, gain settings used a classical closed loop AGC system. The disadvantage of this system is slow response of the AGC to change the input signal. As the result, it is difficult to distinguish between noise and target signal and differentiate amplitude level signal for different targets on radar system application. This paper explains the design of Automatic Gain Control (AGC) system using HMC992LP5E and fuzzy logic controller. The gain value of AGC is determined by input and output signal amplitude level of AGC and also the maximum range of radar targets. AGC gain value setting is provided by a certain voltage value at the pin VCTRL. VCTRL value is calculated by a 32-bit microcontroller using fuzzy logic algorithms. This controller will generate more dynamic value of AGC gain. The AGC output signal amplitude level can be determined based on fuzzy logic algorithms. So that, the target signal captured by the pulse radar receiver system will be more easily identified and can be used for other applications. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present the extended version of the conventional DEED to overcome the ramp rate violations when its optimal solutions for one period (normally one day) are implemented repeatedly and periodically over consequent dispatch periods to meet the periodic load demands. This dynamic dispatch problem, which is referred to as EDEED, is a multi-objective optimization problem which simultaneously minimizes both fuel cost and pollutants emission while satisfying a set of constraints. A multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) method has been applied in this article for solving EDEED problem. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated on the 10-unit test system with non-smooth fuel cost and emission level functions in comparison with those methods reported in the literature. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Y-source impedance network is a new topology intended for implementing with high voltage gain converters. In contrary to the original Y-source impedance network, an improved Y-source presented in this paper has the advantage of a continuous input current characteristic. Since achieving high voltage gain and continuous input current, converters employing the proposed impedance network are suitable for implementing with renewable energy sources like fuel cell and photovoltaic systems. In this paper, analysis and operation principles of the developed network have been discussed. Moreover, mathematical equations and input current ripple analysis have been demonstrated in detail. Finally, both computer simulations and experimental results from a boost dc-dc converter are presented to validate the performance of the developed network. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper presents the solution for the suppliers’ aims to achieve profit more than the rivals participating in the competition. The supplier (decision maker) optimization problem is formulated and their bid quantities are optimized using Self adaptive Differential Evolution (SaDE). A six unit system is used to illustrate the methodology for a single trading period with both elastic and inelastic loads. The performance of the test systems under perfect and oligopoly market situations are compared to show the importance of optimization of bidding parameters in deregulated markets. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the method in solving the supplier profit maximization problem. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, Procedural Content Generation (PCG) has become a popular alternative for creating video games content. In this paper, we attempt to create a PCG for valid video game racing tracks while optimizing the fun they give to players. To achieve this, we represent a racing track as a sequence of parameterized segments, evaluate it using a multi objective fitness function, and then search for the optimum track by using search algorithms. Two search algorithms are used as alternatives to compare the effect it has on the racing tracks generated. The result we report show that the tracks generated can successfully match the validity criteria of being closed, continuous, and non-intersecting. More than that, they can also successfully create a certain degree of fun for players, according to data acquired from a questionnaire given to testers. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper resumes a Direct Torque Fuzzy Control (DTFC) of an Induction Motor (IM). The novel approach aims to ameliorate the performances of the conventional Direct Torque Control (DTC) by considerably reducing electromagnetic torque and stator flux ripples and improving the form of stator current. The proposed controller is based on fuzzy logic technique and it is developed in order to be implemented on Field Programmable Gate Array chip (FPGA) by using Matlab/Simullink package and Xilinx System Generator (XSG) toolbox. The efficiency of proposed technique is evaluated through simulative results that show its performance compared to conventional one. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The decomposition of signals into their primitive or fundamental constituents play a vital role in removing noise or unwanted signals, thereby improving the quality and utility of the signals. There are various decomposition techniques, among which the linear wavelet technique and the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) are the most recent and widely used ones. This paper presents a comparative study of the decomposition of spatially inhomogeneous test functions namely Doppler and Bumps used by statisticians. An effort is made in this article to compare the efficiency of the noise removal in the resulting decompositions at various approximation levels using wavelets and by varying the number of reconstruction modes in VMD. Surprisingly it is found that the VMD technique yields better results with more accuracy for a specific set of parameters irrespective of the spatial character of the function. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The induction motor operating reliability is a major issue of modern industry since faults may occur and disrupt the production process. In this work, the diagnostic potential of the line or phase current frequency spectrum for the identification of the broken bar fault in the cage induction motor is investigated depending on the stator three-phase winding configuration. The work is carried out with transient finite element method (FEM) simulations considering motor operation under nominal mechanical load. The study will concern the traditional broken bar fault signatures but also higher order harmonics and will lead to a comparison between their reliability to detect the broken bar fault, with respect to prior work. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The power quality (PQ) issue is get new measurement because of power system rebuilding and moving pattern towards distributed generation. PQ comprises of an expansive number of unsettling influences, for example, voltage sags, swells, harmonics, notch, flicker and so forth. To conquer these issues identified with the PQ, FACTS gadgets are presented. A distribution static compensator (D-STATCOM) is one of the FACTS gadgets makes it productive answers for enhancing the PQ in distribution system. So as to diminish the PQ issues, the D-STATCOM exhibitions are enhanced. In this paper, a Gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is proposed for enhancing the execution of D-STATCOM and remunerating the PQ. The algorithm is a recent improvement in the territory of nature enlivened calculations for worldwide streamlining. The proposed strategy is utilized for extricating the reference current for repaying the D-STATCOM and controlling the dc link voltage. The proposed technique based D-STATCOM is utilized for reducing the harmonic disturbances. In addition, the load balancing and reactive power compensation is accomplished. The proposed technique is executed in MATLAB/Simulink platform and its execution is assessed. The execution of the proposed technique is contrasted and the FLC controller and ANN controller. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two approaches in nanoscale device fabrication are the top-down and bottom-up approach. The later method promises application in VLSI technology but a major challenge existed: integration for other devices as well as electrodes. Described in this paper, we have optimized preparation process for photoresist coating and photolithography. Patterned gold-nanoparticles has been successfully deposited on top of a silicon substrate using positive photoresist as a mask. SEM characterization confirmed the presence of nanoparticles with average diameter of 55 nm while as EDS spectrum confirms the presence of gold nanoparticles on the patterned Si substrate. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - We propose a new reconstruction method of an object image from its digital hologram. The proposed matching pursuit on a pair of domains (MPPD) method employs spatial-domain bases and their (Fresnel) transform-domain pair. The transform domain bases are used to decompose the hologram, which yield a set of coefficients. Then, these coefficients are used to reconstruct the spatial-domain object image using the predefined spatial bases. We show the robustness of the proposed method against noise on a simulated hologram of spherical particles. By employing spatial-domain Gaussian bases and its transform pair, the image of these particles are recovered successfully. A possibility to extend the 2D (twodimensional) case to a 3D (three-dimensional) one for slice reconstruction from a single hologram is also explored. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by using a real microscopic-hologram of silica gel spherical particles, which shows promising results. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper presents a novel algorithm of Multiagent Reinforcement Learning called State Elimination in Accelerated Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (SEA-MRL), that successfully produces faster learning without incorporating internal knowledge or human intervention such as reward shaping, transfer learning, parameter tuning, and even heuristics, into the learning system. Since the learning speed is determined among others by the size of the state space where the larger the state space the slower learning might become, reducing the state space can lead to faster convergence. SEA-MRL distinguishes insignificant states of the state space from the significant ones and then eliminating them in early learning episodes, which aggressively reduces the scale of the state space in the following learning episodes. Applying SEA-MRL in gridworld multi robot navigation shows 1.62 times faster in achieving learning convergence. This algorithm is generally applicable for other multiagent task challenges or general multiagent learning with large scale state space, and perfectly applicable with no adjustments for single agent learning situation. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - High voltage impulse is one of the means used in a variety of insulating materials testing. It causes also discharge, generally as visualization of lightning strikes. This research aimed to design a prototype of miniature current discharge pulse generation with various burdens. The alternating low voltage was rectified first and multiplied by using the modified Cockroft-Walton voltage multiplier. The yielded output voltage was a d.c. high voltage, which subsequently entered the pulse generator circuit, penetrating the sphere gap, after filling the charge on the first capacitor and then fill in the second capacitor. The shape of the output pulse current was tapped by using a resistive voltage divider. Thus, the various pulse current waveforms could be measured and recorded by a storage digital oscilloscope. Almost first discharge were occurred in around from 1 µs to 2 µs. The waveforms with the pure resistive burdens would trend to be symmetrical to almost on positive parts. On the other hand, the waveforms with the resistive and capacitive dominated burdens would be shorter, i.e. around 16.8 µs, than those resistive dominated burdens. The wave frequency response of discharge on the capacitive dominated burdens would more declivous or prevalent than those on the resistive dominated burdens. The latter characteristics were indicated by the specific capacitive dominated property. The capacitive property that store charge was expected as cause the latter characteristics. The dominated capacitive existence made the repetitive discharge would be shorter than those the dominated resistive existence. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper presents a new approach to the solution of optimal power generation for economic emission load dispatch (EELD) using space search algorithm to a hybrid power system. The proposed space search algorithm (SSA) has been applied on 23 benchmark test functions and the results were compared with Gravitational search algorithm (GSA), Particle swarm optimization (PSO), Differential evolution (DE) and Grey wolf optimizer (GWO). The results show that SSA method is able to provide very competitive results compared to other established meta-heuristics. After that, the economy objective function is minimized, followed by minimization of emission level objective function. Then, both the objectives are combined through a fuzzy coordination method to form a fuzzy decision making (FDM) function. Maximizing the FDM function then solves the original two-objective problem. The minimization and maximization tasks of this optimization problem are solved by the space search algorithm. The optimisation technique was applied to the hybrid system and a conventional power system with only three conventional thermal generators. The results by hybrid system provide cheaper generation schedule in comparison to individual system of thermal generators. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The paper proposes optimal location for fixing fuel cells in a distribution system using an innovative hybrid technique. The novelty of the proposed method is the combined performance of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) technique, thereby integrating GA first phase, RNN technique and GA second phase. The optimum location for fixing the fuel cell is attained by using the GA first phase. Here, the GA first phase utilizes the load flow data at different loading conditions for determining the optimum location. The RNN is aptly trained by the target fuel cell size and the corresponding inputs such as load variation and bus number. During the testing time, the RNN provides the fuel cell capacity according to the load variation and bus number. By using the attained fuel cell capacities, the GA second phase optimizes the fuel cell capacity to minimize the power loss and the voltage deviation. The objective function mainly helps to improve the bus voltage profile and the power loss reduction. Thus, the proposed hybrid technique is implemented in the MATLAB/simulink platform and its effectiveness is analyzed by comparing it with the GA, PSO and other hybrid PSO techniques. The comparison results unequivocally demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach and confirm its sterling potential to solve the problem. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Robustness and invisibility are all important points in video watermarking technology. In this paper, we propose the new scheme to increase the robustness and keep the invisibility as good. Through the experiment, we get the relationship linear curve between QP values and watermark strength values, and using that relationship, we get the better detection rate increased by 7%~14%. The performance increases are 6.94%, 8.03%, and 14.32% about MPEG2, MPEG4 and H.264 attacks respectively. For the subjective quality assessment, we experiment with the 23 general non-specialists. In spite of increasing the performance, we have still good invisibility which is checked by subjective test. It is difficult to obtain the distinction between the source and watermarked content statistically. ï¿½ 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Condition based monitoring and assessment of insulating oil has become a vital constituent for ascertaining the reliability of oil-filled transformers. Partial Discharge (PD) measurement is one of the proven techniques to analyze the variations in discharge activity in insulating oil degradation under normal and abnormal operating conditions. PD activity is connected with the physical characteristics of oil and other external influencing factors like applied voltage, temperature, etc. Since PD pulse signature patterns are complex non-markovian process, capturing the time dependent variation of discharges during degradation of oil is important in understanding the dynamics of degradation. PD data is measured under the influence of both accelerated electrical stress conditions. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is applied to characterize the stochastic behavior of the PD pulse transition in the insulation system. Continuous Density Hidden Markov Model (CDHMM) has been implemented to analyze the changes associated with PD phenomenon stress conditions. The PD signal has been preprocessed to compute the optimal state transition matrix using the Viterbi algorithm. The results show that the transition of PD pulses can be identified using the state transition matrix which display unique and significant changes in the discharge activity in insulating oil under different accelerated electrical stress conditions. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Tracking any moving object is certainly a challenging task. It becomes considerably more complicated as the number of object increases. For such a system, the utilization of some sensors working collaboratively will give a distinct advantage. In the work presented here, the problem of a visual tracking system developed for a multitarget multicamera environment, is considered and a solution based on joint algorithm between random set theory and distributed estimation process is proposed. The complexity of an object tracking system emerges from the uncertainties present in the system, such as noise, clutter, occlusion, ambiguous object movement, changes of object appearance, etc. In order to handle these hurdles, particle filter algorithm based on recursive Bayesian filtering approach is employed to perform the logical inferencing process, and random set theory is used to manage the multitarget nature of the system, while distributed computation mechanism is applied to handle many sensors operated in the area of investigation. The performance of proposed algorithm is examined using real video data captured from two UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) flown at 52 m height. The results show that the tracking system successfully detects and tracks the targets. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, an enhanced control scheme is proposed to improve the performances of a three-phase shunt active power filter. The objective is to compensate for current harmonics and reactive power in three-phase power distribution grid. The proposed control scheme is inserted in the active filter in order to regulate the DC link capacitor voltage. This control scheme is based on the combination of a fuzzy logic controller and an ADALINE network (Adaptive FLC). The ADALINE is used to filter the measured DC voltage; an error is than calculated and with its derivative are injected in a fuzzy controller. The output of this controller is used to generate the compensating currents that are injected in the power distribution grid. The controller’s outputs are combined with calculated reference currents. These are obtained for each phase with an ADALINE network which yields to a precise decomposition of the measured currents. Based on Fourier series, this neural approach provides in real time each individual harmonic component of the measured currents without any additional reference frame transforms. Simulation tests show that the proposed approach is able to significantly reduce the fluctuations of the DC voltage. The results also show that the proposed control approach can compensate for highly distorted line currents in a better way than with more traditional techniques. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The implementation of digital image processing required detailed knowledge of both hardware design and hardware description languages. This paper presents an efficient approach for the implementation of real time hardware digital image processing algorithms without requiring detailed knowledge of hardware design and hardware description languages. The purpose of this work is to achieve a real time hardware implementation with higher performance in both size and speed. It focuses on the implementation of an efficient architecture for image processing algorithms like segmentation (threshold) and contrast stretching by using the fewest possible system generator blocks for DSP tool, which integrates itself with the MATLAB based Simulink graphics environment and relieves the user of the textual HDL programming. While Past research has shown that the Image enhancement techniques on FPGA based on the Xilinx System Generator. This study connect between image histogram and Image enhancement techniques depending on the type of enhancement required. This paper describes also the methodology for implementing real-time DSP applications on FPGA and concept of hardware software co-simulation for digital image processing by using the Mathworks model-based design tool Simulink / Xilinx System Generator (XSG). Performances of efficient architectures are implemented on FPGA Virtex5 (XUPV5-LX110T). © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this correspondence we presents the performance analysis of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique incorporating maximal-ratio combining with transmit antenna selection (MRC/TAS) in frequency-flat Rayleigh fading channels. The expression of probability density function (pdf) for MRC/TAS (N t , 1; N r ) scheme has been derived. The probability of outage is examined first. Further by the efficient use of pdf, the closed-form expressions of bit error probability (BEP) and channel capacity have been evaluated for MRC/TAS as a single infinite series of tabulated function. The asymptotic BEP expression shows that MRC/TAS system can achieve full diversity gain equal to N; t N r . © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - A huge number of wind turbine generators will be integrated into the existing power systems in the near future because it has been identified as one of the most promising field of energy industry. Wind turbines are required to remain connected to the grid during a fault condition so as to support constant power supply. It is therefore necessary to investigate the impact of wind turbine generators on the stability of power systems. This paper presents a comparative study of available wind generator types and examines the effect of penetration level on the power system. Simulations have been performed to compare and demonstrate the transient behavior of a typical 5-machine 22-bus system with and without wind power integration. The simulation results reveal that the transient behavior of wind generators has significant effect on the overall stability of power systems and the increase in penetration level may induce the instability into the systems. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper presents a full dynamic visual serving flight controller design using command filtered backstepping (CFBS) control law for a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A full nonlinear dynamic model that involves feature point motion, pan-tilt gimbal mechanism movement, and UAV flight dynamic is adapted to the controller design of CFBS. The proposed design scheme can provide a system which is easy to implement in various fixed-wing UAV platforms, since it only needs physical characteristics such as mass, mass of inertia, center of gravity, geometry and propeller-engine to configure the system. Further, additional novel algorithms are developed and added to the original CFBS control law design to make longitudinal and lateral-directional maneuvers safer and smoother. The proposed algorithm is implemented and tested in both numerical simulation and hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS). HILS is conducted by implementing the algorithm on the real UAV on-board hardware that consist of an embedded PC for image extraction and a microcontroller for the flight controller. The numerical simulation and HILS results show that the developed system is able to perform target tracking and pursuing task effectively. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - This paper addresses on three different architectures of digital decimation filter design of a multi-standard RF transceivers. Instead of using single stage decimation filter network, the filters are implemented in multiple stages using FPGA to optimize the area, delay and dynamic power consumption. The proposed decimation filter architectures reflect the considerable reduction in area and dynamic power consumption without degradation of performance. The filter coefficients are derived from MATLAB, the filter architectures are implemented and tested using Xilinx SPARTAN FPGA.First, the types of decimation filter architectures are tested and implemented using conventional binary number system. Then the two different encoding schemesi.e. Canonic Signed Digit (CSD) and Minimum Signed Digit (MSD) are used for filter coefficients and then the architecture performances are tested.The results of CSD and MSD based architectures show a considerable reduction in the area and power against the conventional number system based filter design implementation. The implementation results reflect that considerable reduction in area of 47.89% and dynamic power reduction of 28.64% are achieved using hybrid architecture. © 2015 School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - The influence of injecting third harmonic signal into three-phase sinusoidal reference signal of natural sampled PWM technique on output current ripple and neutral current of three-level inverter is analyzed in this paper. Expressions for both inverter output current ripple and neutral current as a function of PWM reference signal are derived first. Then, it is shown that injecting one fourth or twenty five percent third harmonic signal into three-phase sinusoidal reference signal may produce minimum output current ripple and neutral current. The twenty five percent third harmonic injection signal can simultaneously minimize output current ripple and neutral current of the three-level inverter only for unity power factor operation. Simulation and experimental results are included to show validity of the analysis results. © 2015 School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Symbols are confined to documents either as isolated notations or hand-written texts with a number of notable features, however distinguishes, from other writing variations. This paper describes a method to separate and classify handwritten non-cursive symbols (of Grantha) from document images. This method use statistical correlation coefficient for separation and classification instead of recognizing the symbols. The model comprises of selection, separation of symbols and preprocessing steps, like normalization, skeletonization, and finally, the classification. The method employs bounding box algorithm for the location of script symbols in the document images. The efficiency of the method is, as such, it selects only the script symbols and excludes non-symbol components. In the proposed method, preprocessing steps makes the separated symbols suitable for classification. For experimental verification, 50 degraded document images of varying deteriorating complexities were tested. The resulting symbol classification rate (i.e., the proportion of symbols automatically classified) was obtained close to, ≈ 70%. © 2015 School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In this paper, we propose design of the boost converter with hybrid transformer ratio for hybrid power source charging station. This converter is addressed as DC step up converter. This converter has high ratio conversion that converter to DC bus 24 Volt to AC system 220Volt. The combination between resonance modes and pulse width modulation (PWM) is used to achieve high voltage ratio conversion. The advantage of proposed method is use only single switching device; therefore it is easy to control. Moreover, voltage stress on diode and switching device is relatively low and independent from input voltage. The experiment result show that the converter is able to operates in wide range input voltage and has good conversion efficiency up to 90%. Based on the operation and conversion characteristic, the converter can be operated in power inverter with duty ratio 0.7-0.8 to synchronizing with AC system. © 2015 School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) was proposed as one solution to overcome uncertainty noises in primary signal detection. It increases capability of primary signal detection and accuracy. This paper investigates the performance of decentralized CSS model with limited sensing capability in cognitive radio (CR) system. Simulation considers multiple secondary users (SUs) sense license channel and distributes their sensing result among others. Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework is used as an aid for SU that partially sense over license channel. It models license channel as Markov discrete process where idle and busy states is represented by number of “0” and “1”. To validate this work, we make some comparisons against single user sensing, centralized multiuser cooperative spectrum sensing (CMCSS) and decentralized random CSS model. The derived results show that CMCSS and DMCSS model has better performance than single user sensing and decentralized random CSS model. CMCSS outperforms DMCSS model. However, DMCSS model still outperforms decentralized random CSS. At certain case, DMCSS performance matched to the throughput achieved by CMCSS when probability of selected channel (p) = 1. © 2015 School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Topologies for three-phase salient rotor flux-switching machines having non-overlap armature and field windings are presented. Salient rotor is used to modulate and switch the polarity of the flux linkage in the armature winding and this phenomenon represents the basic principle of operation of these types of machines. Non-overlap windings and toothed-rotor are the clear advantages of these topologies as the copper losses gets reduce and rotor becomes more robust. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is used to examine the three phase topology of proposed Wound-field flux switching motor (WFFSM) with non-overlap windings and salient rotor. Coil test analysis, peak armature flux linkage, cogging torque, induced emf and average torque are examined. On the basis of these analyses, it is confirmed that 24S-10P has high flux linkage, less cogging torque and high average torque as compared to other WFFSMs. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Efforts to integrate sensor networks into internet have been widely pursued. A FTR-HTTP (Finite Time Response Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)has beenproposed to integrate the sensor networks witha data collector server through internet. The FTRHTTP has two controlvariables, i.e. forced sleep duration (K) and maximum response time (MaxTr),in which both affect the performance of the FTR-HTTP. This paper reports some experimental researches that demonstratethe effects of variations of the two control variables on the performance of the FTR-HTTP. The results show that increasing the value of Kvariable has an effect on the improvements of three performance measures of FTR-HTTP, i.e. average response time, average energyefficiency, and average request timeout. Where as, increasing the value of Kvariable can increase the value of average update time, which can be described as a sampling frequency of data transmission to the server. It means that increasing the value of Kvariable can improve thethree performance measures (average response time, average energy efficiency, and average request timeout), but trade off must be made in the expense of averageupdate time. The results of the experiment show that increasing the value of Max TR variable has little positive effect on three performance measures of the FTR-HTTP (average response time, energy efficiency, and average update), but it has little negative effects on the other performance measure of the FTR-HTTP (average request timeout). Finally, a closed-loop control system being able to achieve the optimal performance of the FTR-HTTP, by controlling the value of K and Max TR variables, can be proposed for futureworks. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Wind Power forecasting is an important subject of concern for reliable operations of grid and it has been studied from different points of views of both accuracy and reliability. So with an aim of improvement in prediction accuracy this paper presents a hybrid wind power prediction machine for Ontario Electricity Market (OEM) on single step ahead basis in which Wavelet Transform (WT) is used for preprocessing of input wind power data, then the pre-processed data is trained by neural networks. In this initially, the parameters of neural networks (biases & weights) are initialized as random &then at second stage are optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) base training algorithm. The varying time series input training data patterns are used in order to remove the overtraining & over-fitting problem so that the maximum accuracy is achieved. The results of proposed method are compared with Naive Predictor, Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN) & Particle Swarm Optimization based Neural Network (PSONN) and is presented in the form of comparative tables on Mean absolute error (MAE) & mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) scale with emphasis on weekly as well as monthly predictions. The data used by proposed model for estimation is collected from Ontario Electricity Market for the year 2009-12 and tested for such a long period of one year on single step ahead basis. It is found that the accuracy of proposed model is far better than the other models. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, the application of operational transconductance amplifier (OTA), in addition to comparing with the interior structures of the most important available integrated circuits, have been analyzed. In this regard, a model in Spice has been presented to facilitate the trend of education for the undergraduate based on OTA theoretical analysis. The present paper aims to offer a model for the OTA in Spice from which the theoretical features of the said amplifiers can be incorporated. This causes the application of the OTA integrated circuits, under the impression and contribution of computerized simulation, and the accuracy of the theoretical analyses to be instructed and to be studied respectively. At the end, to show the merit and competence of the proposed model, three practical circuits, whose results are compared to the theoretical values and simulation accuracy, are represented. The proposed model covers the high speed of simulation and appropriate numerical convergence. © 2014, International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Performance measurement of transmission system is vital to proper planning and operations of power systems in the presence of deregulation. Degree of performance is often measured by technical and financial key performance indicators (KPIs) often determined by unavailability, quality of supply and energy lost. This paper implement a novel method, Hybridized continuous repeated power flow (HCR-PF) to compute inter-area ATC and gives a method based on computed ATC to determine the transmission efficiency by measuring the transmission system transfer efficiency in terms of available transfer capability. Available Transmission Transfer Efficiency (ATTE) expresses the percentage of real power received resulting from inter-area available power transfer. The results show that HCR-PF provides a good approximate alternative to ATC computation which is validated using IEEE 30 bus test network. The Tie line (physical path) performance is obtained by calculating the required sending end quantities with specified receiving end ATC and the receiving end power circle diagram. © 2014, International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In this paper, the proposed flip-flop reduces power consumption by reducing the clock switching power that was wasted otherwise. Unlike many other gated flip-flops, the proposed gated flip-flop has state retention property to save power and to switch circuit between idle and active modes smoothly. The feedback path is also improved in the proposed flip-flop to decrease power dissipation. The proposed clock-gating scheme only requires 4 transistors, thus occupies the small silicon area. Further, the proposed clock gating network can be shared among a group of flip-flops to reduce the power and area overhead of the gating network. The simulation results show that for all supply voltages, the proposed flip-flop has the least power dissipation among all the designs for low switching activities. The proposed flip-flop has up to 7.82 times power improvement than the existing flip-flops. However, for 100% data activity, the proposed FF consumes up to 2.71 times power than the existing flip-flops. The proposed clock gated flip-flop structure is best suited for applications where input signal switching activity is low and speed is not a crucial factor. © 2014, International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - In this paper, a neural network (NN)-bacterial foraging algorithm (BFA) is proposed to control the load frequency of the power system. Traditionally, the tumbling decision element of BFA is defined by the stochastic values. But, these values are changed as per the variations of chemotactic step size so that the convergence time is increased. Here, NN is used to ensure the distribution of stochastic value with respect to the chemotactic step size and thus the performance of BFA is enhanced. The feed forward NN is used here with back propagation training algorithm. Using the proposed controller, the controller error, load changes, and speed changer position are tuned and the stability of the interconnected power system is improved. The proposed tuning controller is implemented in MATLAB/Simulink platform and the load frequency control responses are evaluated. The performances of proposed controller are compared with those of the PID controller and the BFA-PID controller. ©2014 School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - The presence of metallic contaminating particles lowered the dielectric strength of the gas sharply. The determination of the insulation breakdown inside gas insulated bus duct requires the knowledge of the field distribution inside it. Finite Element Method (FEM) has been used throughout this work, for its favorable accuracy, to calculate the electric field distribution inside the bus duct. In this paper, the electrostatic modeling of gas insulated bus duct (GIBD) with particle contamination is studied. The effect of particle length, hemi-spherical radius and ratio (L/r) on the electric field values is presented. The effect of the dielectric coating of the inner surface of enclosure, is presented and discussed. Multi-contaminating fixed particles are considered in this work and the electric field distribution in this case is presented. The effect of particle length and radius of middle fixed particle of multi contaminating particles on the electric field values are also studied. Electric field distribution around disc-spacer with and without an earthed particle contamination is presented and discussed. Finally, the effect of distance between particle and spacer on the electric field values is also studied. © 2014, International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is a great resolution calling for smart grids in recent years. Introduction of new technologies, that make the network flexible and controllable, is a main part of smart grid concept and a key factor to its success. Transmission network as a part of system network has drawn less attention. Transmission switching as a transmission service can release us from load shedding and remove the constraints’ violations. In addition to removing the congestion and decreasing the system cost, transmission switching may damage generating units due to transient states in instance of reconfiguration. Therefore, in optimal transmission switching, the system security, practical limitations and possible damages should be considered. In this paper transmission switching is modeled in probabilistic energy and spinning reserve day-ahead market clearing problem to guaranty the network security standards. The results show that proposed transmission switching in addition to significant decrease in system cost, can improve the other network characteristics such as system reliability. © 2014, International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

AB  - Digital images are compressed at high compression ratios for storage and communication purposes and are thereby affected by visual blocking artifact. Various filtering techniques are available for reducing the visual blocking artifact of compressed images. In this paper, a 3D spatial filter which uses a negative like image of the image to be deblocked to reduce the compression artifact of the compressed image. The Mean Structural Similarity Index Measure (MSSIM) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) are used in this paper to assess the quality of the restored images. The results obtained show that these techniques effectively remove the compression artifact from the compressed digital images.

AB  - Voltage stability is a common issue in developing power system. It is mainly affected by reactive power balance in the system. If reactive power is not well planned and managed, there is possibility of occurrence of voltage instability in the system. One solution to prevent voltage instability in the system is by VAR compensation. In this work, new technique to determine the placement of different types of shunt VAR compensators based on sensitivity method is presented. Simultaneous planning of SVC and STATCOM placement is also conducted. Improvement in system stability is achieved using the method.

AB  - The use of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) has led to increased concentration of this gas in the atmosphere. The purpose of this work is to investigate the behaviour of SF6-N2 mixtures that can be considered as a potential substitute of pure SF6. The onset corona discharge voltages have been determined from the measurements of the currentvoltage characteristics under high pressures and with highly inhomogeneous fields. The results show that the onset voltages increase with the increase of the gas pressure and are relatively higher for positive polarity. It can also be seen that for low concentrations of SF6 in the mixture the increase of the onset voltages is substantial, followed by a slow increase for elevated concentration of SF6 in the mixture, which, can be an advantage for the substitution of SF6.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to develop a 2D Finite Elements (FEM) model to study and analyse an Electromagnetic Energy Recovery Damper (EERD) for road vehicles to quantify the electrical power output for various cycles of vibrations created by roads irregularities. The EERD transforms the kinetic energy due to vibrations to electrical energy. The developed model is based on the governing magnetic field equations expressed in terms of magnetic vector potential solved using the nodal-based finite element method and sequentially coupling between the electromagnetic and the mechanical equations obtained after modelling a quarter of the vehicle system. The coupling is carried out firstly through the magnetic force, and secondly by the modified flux distribution due to the moving part displacements simulated by the Macro-Element method. The cycles of vibrations are transmitted to the device as vertical displacements. The obtained results are mainly the electrical power output, the deflection, the magnetic force and the induced electromotive force, for considered cycles of vibrations.

AB  - A new fabrication process of MEMS structure prototype of a translational vibratory z-axis gyroscope sensing element is presented. This structure consists of proof mass, driving devices, sensing devices, and suspensions, using the combination of MEMS bulk and surface technology with DRIE etching techniques on the surface and a suspended structure formation using anisotropic etching on the backside of the standard SOI wafer. The mask for the fabrication process was designed using L-Edit software. With this technique, the capacitance and the mass of proof mass can be increased thus increasing the gyroscope sensitivity to sense the Coriolis force. The MEMS-based translational vibratory z-axis gyroscope was static characterized by SEM measurements, visually and resistance measurement, wiring checking, and vibration checking by a given acoustic wave gyroscope excitation.

AB  - The design and performance optimization of X-band reconfigurable reflectarray antennas have been discussed in this paper concentrating mainly on the phase characteristics. Liquid crystals based substrates and slot embedded patch elements have been proposed as two different techniques for the design of reflectarrays with frequency tunability characteristics. Reflectarray patch elements constructed on anisotropic liquid crystal substrate are proposed to be employed as a dynamic phase control strategy for terrestrial systems. A detailed analysis of dynamic phase range and frequency tunability with respect to dielectric anisotropy is presented for two different anisotropic liquid crystal substrate materials. The investigated liquid crystals substrates provided a maximum reduction of 14.1% in volume for reflectarray design at 10 GHz. Moreover rectangular slots on the patch elements are shown to offer a maximum frequency tenability of 1.7GHz. The Finite Integral Method (FIM) validated by waveguide scattering parameter measurements demonstrated a dynamic phase range of 314° and a volume reduction of up to 24.36%.

AB  - In this paper, the performance of multicarrier direct sequence code division multiple access (MC-DS-CDMA) system equipped with a suppression filter is analyzed. A suppression filter is used in the MC-DS-CDMA receiver for suppressing narrowband interference (NBI) over a Rayleigh fading channel. The NBI is assumed to be multi binary phase shift keying narrow band (BPSK NB) signals which exist in all subcarriers of the MC-CDMA system. The effect of suppression filter coefficients, MC-DS-CDMA system parameters, and the NBI parameters on the performance of the system is studied. The analysis shows that, the suppression filter can improve the MC-CDMA system performance significantly, and then increases the MC-CDMA system capacity. It is shown that, increasing the number of taps to be more than nine taps increases the complexity of the filter and does not add any performance gain to the system. The system with a suppression filter has better performance than the system without a suppression filter at a range of values of the ratio of the offset of the interference carrier frequency existing in a subband to the half spread spectrum bandwidth of this subband, (q), which varies from zero up to a greater value of (q) at which using the suppression filter is useless. This value of q at which the system with and without a suppression filter have the same performance depends on the level of the signal to interference power ratio.

AB  - This paper presents an experimental study on long time range breakdown of Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) under very high dc applied fields (Emean) of 2.0 MV/cm or 3.0 MV/cm. Breakdown time lag and space charge distribution are simultaneously measured for a 200-μm-thick LDPE sheet with positive-semicon and negative-evaporated Al electrodes. A voltage is applied to the sheet until the dc breakdown occurs. 20 samples are tested for both the applied voltages. It should be remarked that 50% survivor probability T50, corresponding to time in which breakdown occurs for 10 samples out of 20, is 70 min for 40 kV, whereas it is 90 min for 60 kV. Results of the space charge measurement by pulsed electro acoustic (PEA) method indicates that a large number of positive charges are injected from the semicon-anode and they are accumulated in the bulk of LDPE, so that field distribution in LDPE is strongly distorted. The maximum field strength Emax(t) in LDPE after the space charge penetration for 60 kV becomes higher than that for 40 kV. However, the distortion ratio Emax(t)/Emean under 40 kV is higher than that under 60 kV. This is because the positive charges packet produced by 40 kV penetrates into deeper area of the bulk as compared with that by 60 kV.

AB  - This paper proposed an artificial neural network (ANN)-based approach to mitigate harmonic overvoltages during transformer energization. Uncontrolled energization of large power transformers may result in magnetizing inrush current of high amplitude and switching overvoltages. The most effective method for the limitation of the switching overvoltages is controlled switching since the magnitudes of the produced transients are strongly dependent on the closing instants of the switch. We introduce a harmonic index that it's minimum value is corresponding to the best case switching time. Also, in this paper three learning algorithms, delta-bar-delta (DBD), extended delta-bar-delta (EDBD) and directed random search (DRS) were used to train ANNs to estimate the optimum switching instants for real time applications. ANNs training is performed based on equivalent circuit parameters of the network. Thus, trained ANN is applicable to every studied system. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed index and accuracy of the ANN-based approach, two case studies are presented and demonstrated.

AB  - We observe streak images of dc pre-breakdown in silicone-oil (10 cSt, 100 cSt and 10000 cSt)/low density polyethylene (30 μm in thickness) composite insulation under needle/sphere electrode by using the 20 meter long image guide scope and a streak camera. In the case of composite insulation with 10 cSt of silicone-oil, breakdown light propagates from the needle side under both voltage polarity. However, in the 10000 cSt case, breakdown light propagates from the film side under the negative voltage polarity. The mechanism of these transient phenomena are discussed in this paper.

AB  - This paper deals with a method to determine short-term loading estimation of inter-bus transformers based only a limited data of variables. A grey predicting approach is implemented in this paper to solve dynamic short term load forecasting affected by the climate changes in Indonesian EHV grid, as provided by Jawa Bali Control Center. A dynamic forecasting model is needed due to the uncertain nature of the load predicting process specifically when load changes is correlated with the external effect. Traditional GM (1,1) as basic model is presented to compare with the correlation inter-variable model in grey method for inter-bus loading transformers loading conditions refer to the temperature variation pattern during only the year 2009. GM(1,2) model denotes the correlation and relationship of hourly load demand affected to the 2 (two) tropical seasons, in this case by using local ambient temperature as dynamic variable. The daily load curve for Cawang and Cibatu distribution areas, as representing big local substations in Indonesia spatially, was used to validate the models. The model adequacy and weekly forecasting result had indicated a good and justified grade in error diagnostic checking (MAPE) in each location.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to describe the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and the Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDX) test results of the original and tested electrodes used for Partial Discharge Inception Voltage (PDIV) measurement, as well as for the arcing test of mineral oil. The experimental investigations were performed with the mineral oil, Nynas 4000x, with the water content not more than 10 ppm under room temperature. For PDIV test, the tungsten needle electrodes with the tip radius of 10μm, 20μm, and 40μm respectively were used as the high voltage electrode while the brass plane electrode with 75 mm diameter was used as the grounded electrode with a gap distance of 50 mm. The test circuit was set up according to IEC 60270. The test procedure was performed in accordance with IEC 61294. For the arcing test, the tungsten rod electrodes with the tip diameter of 1 mm, and 2 mm with the curvature of 0.2 mm were used as the high voltage electrode while the brass plane electrode of 75 mm diameter as the grounded electrode with the gap distance of 0.3 mm and 0.8 mm respectively. The test experiment was modified from IEC 60156. The erosion of electrodes used for the mineral oil testing was examined by SEM techniques. SE images, BSE images and EDX spectrum of the original and tested electrodes were produced. The topography, the morphology, and the EDX spectra of the examined electrodes are analyzed. From the test results, there was no evidence to show the erosion of the electrodes after they were used for PDIV and arcing test. It can also be argued that the investigated tungsten needles, rods and brass plane electrodes can be used for PDIV testing and for arcing test without the problem of erosion. In addition, carbon was the main contamination created at the surface of the tested electrodes. The development of carbon was highly possible from the degradation of mineral oil.

AB  - As a result of the rising popularity and necessity of real-time multimedia applications, Quality of Service (QoS)monitoring needs more attention in wireless networks. Due to infrastructureless and mobile nature of wireless mobilead hoc networks (MANETs), QoS monitoring is a challenging task. This paper extends our previously published workand provides a framework for a robust and a multi-metric QoS monitoring infrastructure (MMQoSMI) for MANETs.Three QoS metrics (delay, jitter, and packet loss) are considered by the proposed QoS monitoring framework. TheMMQoSMI nodes are mainly selected based on individual node stability and available bandwidth for each node.Then, these nodes are implicitly connected using link bandwidth and delay as QoS metrics. For an MMQoSMInode to measure the QoS metrics of its directly connected links, it relies on the Minkowski distance approach.This approach measures the selected QoS metrics and then enters them to the distance assessment system whileconsidering customer's QoS requirements of each multimedia application. As a result, MMQoSMI nodes combinethe selected QoS metrics and produce an output that represents the instantaneous QoS. Every node in the MANETassesses the available QoS and then forwards it to its cluster-head node to be used for network monitoring and otherpurposes.

AB  - While the demand of electric power increases and the installation space of power equipment is fixed in a factory, the cubical gas insulated switchgear (CGIS) is gradually applied to medium voltage system due to its small size and easy maintenance. However, it also takes longer time for the repair of CGIS accident. Therefore, the preventive maintenance (PDM) is very important and the most effective method is partial discharge measurement. Unfortunately, the metal-cladded GIS usually make PDM inconvenient, especially for the partial discharge location. This paper provides a fast and easy method for the location of partial discharge in GIS, it can locate the defect quickly and effectively, and the related strategy can be made in advance.

AB  - Forested landscapes such as mangrove have drawn many attentions due to their importance in carbon stock. Many attempts were conducted to obtain suitable mangrove map using multi-spectral remote sensing imagery. However, atmospheric disturbance including cloud limits multi-spectral sensors. In many cases, observation through Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is then required. In this research, C-, L- and P-band fully polarimetric SAR data were evaluated to provide a mangrove map exploiting Wishart classifier. Results indicated that Ceriops was the only distinguishable species at C-band. Observation using longer wavelengths (L- and P-bands) revealed fairly strong attenuation from soil background. However, overall accuracy suggested that P-band produced lowest classification error, hence it was suitable to produce a highly accurate map.

AB  - In this paper, practical evaluation of power control technique to combat multipath fading in wireless mobile communications is performed using computer simulation. We consider two types of power control algorithm in Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system in this paper, namely fixed-step and variable step algorithms. Practical aspects of power control investigated in this paper are focused on the effect of power update step size, fading rates, and feedback transmission error on the power control performance. The results show that the fixed-step power control algorithm exhibits only a slightly lower performance than that of the variable step algorithm, and therefore is more desirable in practice to minimize the signaling bandwidth. The effect of fading rates on power control performance also shows that variable step algorithm outperforms the fixed step algorithm during high fading rates but gives a comparable performance when fading rates are low. Finally when feedback information is subject to transmission errors, the performance of variable-step algorithm degrades more significantly because it is more sensitive to command error than that of fixed-step algorithm.

AB  - Magnetic levitation is a popular topic of research over the years throughout the world due to its wide range of industrial applications. In any DC attraction type suspension system, actuator and guide-way (rail) plays most important role. In this manuscript FEM based analysis of different structures of actuator and rail (guide-way) has been carried out utilizing ANSYS software. Input power to lift power ratio and lift power magnet weight ratio are two major factors for designing actuator and rail in electromagnetic levitation system (EMLS) [1]. These factors are dependent on the magnet dimensions, required gap flux and hence the required current density in the winding. The magnet configurations chosen on the basis of required pole-face area and necessary window area to house the excitation coils. There are various magnet and rail geometries; i.e. magnet with I, U and E profiles and various winding arrangements with flat and U-profile rail. A FEM analysis utilizing ANSYS software has done to find out the flux pattern, working flux density, field intensity, force etc. for different single actuator based levitation system at different operating conditions. Different aspects of rail and actuator have been described based on the ANSYS simulation results. The main objective is to propose a suitable configuration of actuator and guide-rail for a specific DC electromagnetic levitation system.

AB  - The development of electronic media in the world, such as e-learning, communication through the internet, and information system automation, is growing very fast. While the media is mostly developed for people without disability, a question about how this electronic media being used and utilized by people with disability still remains. People with disability, either mentally or physically, with either single (deaf, blind) or multiple handicapped (mentally deaf, mentally blind) have special needs in order to let them work/utilize this electronic media. A proposed model of integrating a multiple-handicapped person information management system has been developed [1]. The former focuses on managing all management aspects of rehabilitation, dormitory, school and workshop such that the activity and the improvement of multiple handicapped individual record can be monitored easily. It emerges some interested point about how this EMHaS Information System being prepare to implement. While these disabled person who have specific characteristics and behaviors became part of the user and they have some difficulties to use the normal electronic devices some preparation activities have taken place. In this paper we discuss on how Enterprise Architecture Planning (EAP) methodology can support the Multiple Handicapped Education Information System development has taken place. Furthermore another study on how Individual Education Program (IEP) in Multiple Handicapped Education Information System can be applied is also explored. The paper also describe a particular design of man-computer interface for improving disabled persons mental and physical ability. A prototype of handicapped interface device has been designed and implemented in rehabilitation institute Bale Endah, Jawa Barat. As a case study the education EMHaS model has been developed based on the Indonesia Multiple Handicapped environment which is run by Bhakti Mitra Utama Foundation (BMUF). It is expected that this integrated information system could helps caregivers and managers to manage and monitor disabled persons daily activity in the school and dormitory area more easily and more comprehensively. Another expectation that this result could be count as one system that is really suitable to implement not only in this multiple handicapped foundation (BMUF) but also in all such multipled handicapped foundation or institutes in Indonesia.

AB  - Substantial portions of presently existing manuscripts exist in the form of folios, for instance, as degraded documents. Manuscriptfolios interpretation produced manually and recognition procedures contain computational errors. This paper uses an automatic approach to examine the selection and the effectiveness of searching techniques for possible speciousfeatures for recognition. The proposed method consists of two basic steps. In the first step, degradedfeatures in manuscript folios are located and computing operations are applied to create a collection of segregation features in the basic unit of the model. The second step uses 4-connectivity and 8-connectivity to generate additional typical features, identify appropriate matching positions, and determine the degree of relevance of retrieved folio images to the research request, based on asegregationmodel. The results obtained show its effectiveness and indicate an improvement over standard methods such as recognition systems without horizontal or vertical text and character segmentation.

AB  - This paper studies finite word-length effects on two different VLSI architectures of integer discrete wavelet transforms (DWT). The two DWT architectures representing two extreme cases are Scheme 1: basis correlation, and Scheme 2: pyramidal algorithm. For signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) evaluations, we consider various values of the length of integer word (W). Our experiments show that W is critical for both schemes, although both schemes perform almost equivalently. We also show that Scheme 1 and Scheme 2 have computational complexities O(N 2) and O(N), respectively. The paper concludes that the word length W has similar critical impacts on the quality of integer DWT of both Schemes, hence Scheme 2 should be used based on lower computational complexity reason.

AB  - Large inductive loads require larger rating of DSTATCOM to generate the required reactive power of the load. Larger the rating of the DSTATCOM higher is the cost. Most distribution system has a base reactive power requirement. The reactive power demand at any instant varies around the base value. A window operation of the DSTATCOM is proposed in this paper. The base reactive power is provided by the TSCs and the DSTATCOM operates within a window (comprising of both inductive and capacitive reactive power) beyond the base reactive power provided by the TSCs. Thus the range of the reactive power compensation of the system is enhanced without the system being limited by the steps in which the TSCs operate. Within the window range, the DSTATCOM provides a continuous and smooth variation in the reactive power generation and can track the change in the VAr requirement very fast. To obtain optimal performance of the combined system, the TSCs are switched through a Fuzzy Logic controller. In this paper, window operation of the DSTATCOM along with Fuzzy Logic Controller operated TSCs is demonstrated for an autonomous asynchronous generator. The entire system has been simulated on MATLAB platform.

AB  - Dielectric insulation is mostly affected due to Partial discharge (PD) pulses, which are resultants of various stress parameters. Normal acquired signal from any insulating material has two components namely actual partial discharge (PD) pulses and noise. Noise suppression is crucial before any (PD) data analysis. PD pulses are short transient, randomly occurred and non-stationary signals. Recent research shows that the Wavelet transform (WT) has achieved good effect in noise rejection with acquired signal. WT proves its suitability by providing information in time and frequency domains simultaneously. Hence, WT can detect these pulses efficiently. PD signals extraction using WT requires set up of various parameters like, optimal mother wavelet selection, decomposition level selection, threshold rule and function determination. This paper presents the vital issues of WT threshold function determination. Here, a method is envisaged for appropriate WT threshold function selection based on acquired signal analysis. This work is carried out on signal measured from transformer. Also, analysis is carried out on the acquired signal and its WT generated signal. Finally, a comparison is carried out to select optimum threshold function selection for WT signal analysis.

AB  - This paper proposes a noninvasive method for estimating the viscoelastic characteristics of arterial walls using pulse waves measured in various parts of the body using a foil-type pressure sensor (FPS) and a photoplethysmogram. The FPS was employed to measure pulse waves based on the tonometry approach for its characteristics of high sensitivity and flexibility as well as its ability to continuously measure the alternating-current component of pulse waves. First, in order to accurately measure the amplitude variation of blood pressure waves, suitable mechanical forces externally applied to the FPS were examined, and it was found that values of 5 - 25 [N] yielded the best performance. Next, to verify the time characteristics of pulse waves, the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) was measured. The results showed that baPWV determined using the FPS and that found with a noninvasive vascular screening device were almost the same. Estimation was then performed to establish arterial viscoelastic indices for the radial artery and the dorsal pedis artery during the application of mechanical pain stimuli. The results suggested that the estimated indices could be used to quantitatively assess vascular response caused by sympathicotonia. Thus, it was concluded that the proposed method enabled noninvasive measurement of pulse waves and estimation of viscoelastic indices.

AB  - In this article, a new observer-based nonlinear controller for excitation control of synchronous generator is presented. First, a nonlinear sliding mode observer for the synchronous machine damper currents is developed. Second, the existence of a control law for the complete seventh order model of a generator, which takes into account the stator dynamics as well as the damper effects, is proved by using the theory of Lyapunov. The stabilizing feedback law for the power system is shown to be Globally Exponentially Stable (GES) in the context of Lyapunov theory. Simulation results, for a single-Machine-Infinite-Bus (SMIB) power system, are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed combined obsever-controller for the transient stabilization and voltage regulation.

AB  - In larges electrical system used in industries, office builidings, or hotels, capacitor banks are usually utilized to compensate the required VAR absorbed by the loads. As the nonliniear loads are increasing rapidly, the risk of resonance phenomenon occured is becoming higher as its terminal voltages are not anymore sinusoidal. On the other hand, many customers have become aware to the problems caused by the harmonics due to the nonlinear loads. In this case, the active power filters (APFs) offer many interesting properties i.e. the elimination of harmonics, phase balancing feature and the power factor correction. The power factor correction feature suggests that the APFs are also able to compensate the VAR which means that the APFs are able to replace completely the capacitor banks. However, the higher reactive power occured in APFs is responsible to the higher current flowing in the switches, thus the higher rating of switches are required which leads to more expensive system. In this paper, an optimized combined system between APF and capacitor bank is proposed. It is not necessary to dump the installed capacitor bank. In contrary, the capacitor bank will help the APF to compensate the VAR as the APF will concentrate mostly to eliminate the harmonics.

AB  - Electrolytic hydrogen offers a promising alternative for long-term energy storage of renewable energies (RE). The long-term excess energy with respect to load demand has been sent to the Electrolyser for hydrogen production and then the fuel cell has utilized this stored hydrogen to produce electricity when there were insufficient wind and solar energies with respect to load requirements. The RE system components have substantially different voltage-current characteristics and they are integrated on the DC bus through a power conditioning devices for optimal operation. The DC power required by the Electrolyser system is supplied by the DC-DC LLC resonant converter. The simulation and experimental results show that the power gain obtained by this method clearly increases the hydrogen production and storage rate from wind-PV systems.

AB  - We present in this work a systematic analysis to identify Sigma Delta Modulators (σΔMs) non-idealities, such as charge injection error, Input/Output conductance ratio error and settling time error. A physical mechanism behind Switched Current (SI) errors is proposed. In the first time, errors mentioned above are treated separately and a behavioural model of SI cell is derived for each non-ideality. In the second time, we propose a behavioural model of Non-inverting Lossless Integrator. For typical variations of SI-related errors, simulations have been made using Matlab/Simulink. Finally we present their influences on both dynamic and static performances of the 2nd order SI Low Pass σΔMs (SI-LPσΔMs).

AB  - Bipedal robot locomotion has been a complicated and challenging matter over the time. This paper describes our work on building omnidirectional walking bipedal robot, included mechanical and electrical design aspect, and its behavior control as well. We adopted a technique introduced by Sven Behnke that enables omnidirectional walking on bipedal robot through the use hierarchical reactive behaviors control architecture. We called the robot "ArtRo". Currently, ArtRo has successfully implemented a body consisting of two legs, lower abdomen, and a dummy weight representing the upper body load, with a total of 12 degrees-of-freedom (DOF). The mechanical system is designed optimally to facilitate the manufacturing process and the computation of robot parameters. The electrical system of ArtRo consists of main controller and actuator system. The main controller is an Atmel's ATmega128-based microcontroller system. The actuator system implements a special method involving Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) to control all ArtRo's servo motors. The Sven Behnke's technique has a low computational complexity. It is proven by its successful implementation on ArtRo's main controller. Adaptation of the technique has been successfully implemented, ArtRo is capable to do omnidirectional walking, whether it is forward walking, side walking, or turning on the spot behavior.

AB  - Gap between designer productivity and IC technology is a challenge for improving embedded system design methodology. Register Transfer Level (RTL) is a current design abstraction that no longer adequate as the starting abstraction level. It needs a new methodology for facing the lack of RTL. Transaction Level Modeling (TLM) is a candidate design methodology to improve designer productivity. It offers many advantages especially on process time reduction. In this paper, a new model transformation method is proposed for transforming TLM model to RTL model design incrementally. TMC (TLM-RTL Model Communicator) is used as a key component in this method. TMC communicates between TLM and RTL model. GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) processor is designed to show transformation process from TLM to RTL model. The experiment results show that model transformation method using TMC is effective for transforming TLM model to RTL model incrementally. These results show the design process improvement using this method.

AB  - Data models provide the foundation to organization's activities since they support the organization's systems and data. Therefore, the quality of the data models is foremost. We describe a methodology to measure the quality of conceptual data models created using a fact oriented data modeling called Fully Communication Oriented Information Modeling (FCO-IM). The measurement method is based on the framework to measure the quality of conceptual model by Lindland et al. Four components are to be considered in the measurement: domain, model, language, and audience interpretation. The quality are measured on three aspects: syntactic quality (measured by syntax correctness), semantic quality (measured by feasible validity and feasible completeness), and pragmatic quality (measured by feasible comprehension). The method is then used to determine the quality of several FCO-IM conceptual data models that were created using a pattern language of conceptual data models, a new method in data modeling that we are currently researching. The method contributes in data modeling area by providing a quantitative and instructive way of measuring the quality of conceptual data models, especially in FCO-IM.

AB  - Partial discharges in oils are influenced by the actual dielectric properties of the liquid and especially degradation products may influence the phenomena. As a consequence of ageing processes in the liquid, oil molecules may be split into molecules of shorter lengths. The energy of a PD in the oil may heat the liquid locally and especially low molecular weight products in the oil will evaporate and form a gaseous phase within the liquid. This second phase can be generated in solids as well as in liquids. In solids the pressure in this gas phase will increase in accordance to the concentration of gas molecules. In liquids, an increase of the concentration of molecules will lead to an extension of the gas volume until the pressure within the void corresponds to the external gas pressure. Consequently, in accordance to Paschen's law gas discharges may occur in this gas phase immediately (i.e. within μs) after a PD that generated the gas filled void. The sequence will be so quick that commonly used equipment may not be able to monitor these discharges separately. Analyses of the pulse shape of the PD signals after the band pass filter showed differences in accordance to the degree of ageing of the oils examined. Possibilities to use characteristic parameters of the pulse shape for diagnostic purposes and especially their correlation to other dielectric properties will be discussed in detail.

AB  - On-line solution of switching angles of Selective Harmonic Elimination (SHE) PWM inverter has been a subject of research since 70s. Recent research has suggested new online control techniques for microprocessor implementation of SHE PWM method such as regular sampled harmonic elimination, space vector techniques, Walsh function harmonic elimination. A method based on curve fitting has been proposed in this paper. The solution trajectories by Newton iteration method are approximately represented by using 7th order polynomial. On-line computation of switching angle (α) is just evaluation of polynomial equation by substituting value of modulation index (m). The complete solutions for unipolar switching pattern to eliminate 3rd to 23rd harmonics in the VSI output using conventional technique and curve fitting technique has been given. The deviations of actual and approximate solutions are also presented along with corroborative experimental results on a 1ph, 230V, 5kVA IGBT based VSI controlled by TMS320LF2406, 16-bit fixed point DSP processor.

AB  - This paper introduces a specific architecture including an infrastructural IP for functional verification and diagnostics, which is suitable for functional core-based testing of an MPEG4 SoC. Our advanced MPEG4 SoC results in a high complexity SoC with limited physical access to many different functional cores. The proposed test method provides direct monitoring and control for each core, which enables core verification at actual speed. It significantly decreases the verification time due to the large number of required test vectors in typical MPEG4 verification. Furthermore, it also makes the system scalable for functional core expansion due to upgrading of standards. The proposed infrastructural IP is also linked to PC-based interactive tools to simplify the verification of individual and integrated cores. It also provides detailed diagnostic data that enables simple system debugging. The debugging tools also feature test-pattern generation and simulation of expected values. Actual system implementation has shown full functionality of our proposed method.

AB  - This paper presents an asymmetric watermarking technique derived from Barni Algorithm, a symmetric watermarking technique, using statistical approach. This asymmetric version uses secret watermark as private key and public watermark as public key. The public watermark has a normal distribution and the private watermark is a linear combination of the public watermark and encrypted version of a secret sequence. The detection process is implemented by correlation test between the public watermark and the received image. Experiments show that the asymmetric technique was proved as robust as its symmtric version againts some typical image processings.

AB  - The unipolar-based devices, silicon schottky (Si) and silicon carbide schottky (SiC) power diodes are investigated for their reverse recovery transient responses and the effects on the switching losses of the FET in the DC-DC converter. Two inductive load chopper circuits are simulated with different test diodes using PSpice software to determine the effectiveness and superiority in each of the devices. All parameter settings are consistent for both converter circuits. The results have shown that the SiC diode has higher energy savings of more than 73.13 % in turn-off switching losses. This eventually corresponds to the reduction of 96.16 % in FET turn-on peak power dissipation of SiC converter. However, there is a minor drawback in drain voltage overshoot of the converter. Some detailed analyses are presented in the paper.
