AB  - Mineral oil is known to have a low biodegradability level and high susceptibility to the fire. These conditions motivate many researchers to look for alternative sources for insulating oil. One of the alternative liquid is palm oil. To verify the suitability of using palm oil as an insulating liquid, it is important to make dielectric properties comparison with the commonly used insulating liquid. This paper presents comparison of temperature effect on dielectric properties of palm oil with mineral type insulating liquid and silicone oil. The measured parameters were breakdown voltage, dissipation factor (tan δ), and dielectric constant. Breakdown voltage measurement was performed in accordance with IEC 156 standard, whereas, the dissipation factor and dielectric constant measurement were conducted based on IEC 60247 standard test methods. The results showed that variations of dielectric properties of palm oil to the temperature change, in general, have the same tendency with those of commonly used insulating liquids i.e. mineral oil and silicone oil. Breakdown voltages and dissipation factors of all tested oils were increased, while their dielectric constants were slightly decreased with the increase of temperature. © 2011 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - Let G be a connected graph and c a proper coloring of G. For i=1,2,...,k define the color class Ci as the set of vertices receiving color i. The color code cΠ(v) of a vertex v in G is the ordered k-tuple (d(v,C1),...,d(v,Ck)) where d(v,C1) is the distance of v to Ci. If all distinct vertices of G have distinct color codes, then c is called a locating-coloring of G. The locating-chromatic number of graph G, denoted by χL(G) is the smallest k such that G has a locating coloring with k colors. In this paper we discuss the locating-chromatic number of amalgamation of stars Sk,m. Sk,m is obtained from k copies of star K1,m by identifying a leaf from each star. We also determine a sufficient condition for a connected subgraph H⊆ Sk,m satisfying χL(H) ≤ χL(Sk,m).

AB  - Since 1993, a number of landslides have been reported in Ulu Klang, Malaysia. These landslides caused fatalities and economic losses. Most of these landslides occurred in man-made slopes. Geographical Information System (GIS) is proposed to be used as the based machine for the production of landslide hazard map. This study highlights the area based landslide hazard assessment at Ulu Klang area using GIS application in order to help the engineer or the town planner to identify the most suitable development area besides predicting the potential landslide hazard area. Four main factors that influence of landslide occurrence were chosen include slope gradient aspect, geology, surface cover/land used and precipitation distribution. Landslide hazardous areas were analyzed and mapped using GIS application and produced a hazard map with five different indexes (i.e., very low, low, medium, high and very high hazard). The results of the analysis were verified using the landslide location data. The result showed that the model was very suitable in predicting landslide hazard and generating landslide hazard maps.

AB  - Demand for higher productivity and good quality for machining parts has encourage many researchers to study the effects of machining parameters using FEM simulation using either two or three dimensions version. These are due to advantages such as software package and computational times are required. Experimental work is very costly, time consuming and labor intensive. The present work aims to simulate a three-dimensional orthogonal cutting operations using FEM software (deform-3D) to study the effects of rake angle on the cutting force, effective stress, strain and temperature on the edge of carbide cutting tool. There were seven runs of simulations. All simulations were performed for various rake angles of -15 deg, -10 deg, -5 deg, 0 deg, +5 deg, +10 deg, and +15 deg. The cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut (DOC) were kept constant at 100 m/min, 0.35 mm/rev and 0.3 mm respectively. The work piece used was ductile cast iron FCD500 grade and the cutting tool was DNMA432 series (tungsten, uncoated carbide tool, SCEA = 0; and radius angle 55 deg). The analysis of results show that, the increase in the rake angle from negative to positive angle, causing the decrease in cutting force, effective stress and total Von Misses strain. The minimum of the cutting force, effective stress and total Von Misses strain were obtained at rake angle of +15 deg. Increasing the rake caused higher temperature generated on the edge of carbide cutting tool and resulted in bigger contact area between the clearance face and the workpiece, consequently caused more friction and wear. The biggest deformation was occurred in the primary deformation zone, followed by the secondary deformation zone. The highest stress was also occurred in the primary deformation zone. But the highest temperature on the chip usually occurs in secondary deformation zone, especially in the sliding region, because the heat that was generated in the sticking region increased as the workpiece was adhered by the tool and later it was sheared in high frictional force.

AB  - Monitoring paddy rice phenology and cropping schedules over wide areas is essential for many applications. Remote sensing provides a viable means to meet the requirement of improved regional-scale data set of paddy rice fields, such as phenological stages. A number of methods have been developed for detecting seasonal vegetation changes by using satellite images. Development of such methods to paddy fields with complex cropping pattern is still challenging. In this study, we developed a method for remotely determining phonological stages of paddy rice that uses time series of two vegetation indices (EVI and LSWI) obtained from MODIS data. We ran the algorithm to determine the planting date, heading date, and harvesting date of paddy rice in 5 districts of West Java Province, using the 8-day composite MODIS Surface Reflectance products (500-m spatial resolution) in 2004. Estimated harvesting dates were then used to calculate paddy rice harvested area. We validated the performance of the method against statistical data in 13 subdistricts. The root mean square errors of the estimated paddy rice harvested area against the statistical data were: 851 Ha for monthly data, 1227 Ha for quarterly data, and 2433 Ha for yearly data. Sub district-level comparisons of paddy rice harvested area between the MODIS estimation and statistical data showed moderate correlation, with coefficient of determination (r2) 0.6, 0.7, and 0.6 for monthly, quarterly and yearly data, respectively. The results of this study indicated that the MODIS based paddy rice phenological detection algorithm could potentially be applied at large spatial scales to monitor paddy rice agriculture on a timely and frequent basis.

AB  - Chlorophyll a is the most abundant pigment on Earth responsible for trapping light energy to perform photosynthesis in green plants. This molecule has been studied for many years from different points of interest with both experimental and theoretical methods. In this study, the Restricted Hartree-Fock /Configuration Interaction Single (RHF/CIS), Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT), and several semi-empirical methods (CNDO/S and ZINDO) calculations were carried out to reconstruct the UV-Vis absorption spectra of chlorophyll a. To some extent, the calculation results based on the single-molecule approach succeeded to reconstruct the absorption spectra, but they required to be rescaled to fit the experimental results. In general, the semi-empirical methods provide a better energy scaling factor. However, they lack vertical transition fine features with respect to the spectrum obtained experimentally. In this case, the ab initio calculations provided more complete features, especially the TDDFT with high-level basis sets, which also has a good accuracy with regards to the transition energies. The contribution of the ground state and excited state orbitals in the main vertical transitions is discussed based on the delocalized nature of the wave functions and the presence of solvents using the polarizable continuum model (PCM). © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - Vertical-axis hydrokinetic turbines with fixed pitch blades typically suffer from poor starting torque, low efficiency and shaking due to large fluctuations in both radial and tangential force with azimuth angle. Maximizing the turbine power output can be achieved only if the mechanism of generation of the hydrodynamic force on the blades is clearly identified and tools to design high-performance rotors are developed. This paper describes an initial experimental investigation to understand more of the performance on vertical-axis turbine related to the effect of fixed-pitch and passive variable-pitch application using airfoil NACA 0018. Comparative analysis according to aspects of rotation and tip speed ratios was discussed. Information regarding the changes of foil position in passive variable-pitch during rotation at a limited range of flow velocity variations test was obtained and analyzed.

AB  - Scheduling is a very tedious task in organizations where duty is around the clock. Constructing timetable for nurses in hospital is one of the challenging jobs for the head nurse or nurse manager. It requires a lot of time to spend for generating a good and fair timetable. Thus, in this study, we propose a cyclical nurse scheduling model using a 0-1 goal programming that would help the head nurse or nurse manager to have less effort on building new schedules periodically. The proposed model satisfies the stated hospital's policies and the nurses' preferences. The result obtained from this model gives an optimal solution where all goals are achieved. The model also provides an unbiased way of scheduling the nurses and thus leads to an overall higher satisfaction and fairness to the nurses and the hospital management. © 2011 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - An experimental study of 23 low-, medium- and high-strength concrete columns is presented in this paper. Square-confined concrete columns without longitudinal reinforcement were designed, and tested under concentric axial compression. The columns were made of concrete with a compressive strength ranging between 30 MPa and 70 MPa. The test parameters in the study are concrete compressive strengths and confining steel properties, i.e. spacing, volumetric ratios and configurations. The effects of these parameters on the strength and ductility of square-confined concrete were evaluated. Of the specimens tested in this study, the columns made with higher-strength concrete produced less strength enhancement and ductility than those with lower-strength concrete. The steel configurations were found to have an important role in governing the strength and ductility of the confined high-strength concrete. Moreover, several models of strength enhancement for confined concrete available in the literature turned out to be quite accurate in predicting the experimental results. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - This paper discusses a study of the application of global spatiotemporal climate datasets and the hydrological model STREAM (Spatial Tools for River Basin Environmental Analysis and Management Options). In the study, set up and calibration of STREAM for the reconstruction of monthly discharge for several locations in the western part of Java, Indonesia, for the period 1983-2002 are carried out. The set up includes the preparation of monthly precipitation and temperature datasets, a digital elevation model of the domain being studied, and maps of land cover and soil water holding capacity. Discharge observations from six stations located mostly in the upper parts of major watersheds in the domain are used to calibrate the model by comparing simulated and observed discharge variables. The model performs reasonably well. Comparison between computed and observed mean monthly discharges yield correlation coefficients ranging from 0.72 to 0.93. The computed mean annual discharge in five out of six observation stations ranges between -8 and 5% with respect to the mean annual observed discharge. This study offers a tool which can be used for reconstructing historical discharge.

AB  - Phase transformation of rice husk ash in the synthesis of ZSM-5 without organic template at various crystallization times has been studied. Zeolite has been synthesized using the hydrothermal method at 175 °C with molar ratio 10Na2O : 100SiO2 : 2Al2O3 : 1800H2O with addition of silicalite-1 as seed. Solids were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared (IR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. Analysis of the results of XRD and IR spectroscopy indicated that ZSM-5 crystalstarted to form at 12 h of crystallization time, reaching high crystallinity after 24 h. With a crystallization time of more than 48 h, the ZSM-5 crystals had completely transformed into more stable quartz phase. Results indicated that phase transformation has occurred, in which an amorphous phase of rice husk ash has been transformed to ZSM-5 crystal phase during the early crystallization stage and continued to transform to disordered α-cristobalite phase and lastly quartz phases. SEM showed that the morphology of the ZSM-5 crystal was of an irregular hexagonal shape with particle size distribution around 3-7 μm. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - The acid failure of aluminium alloy in 2 M hydrochloric acid solution in the presence of Vernonia amygdalina extract was investigated using gasometric technique. Aluminium alloy coupons of dimension 4 cm by 1 cm were immersed in test solutions of free acid and also those containing extract volumes of 2, 3, 4 and 5 cm 3 at ambient temperature for 30 minutes. The volumes of hydrogen gas evolved as a result of the rate of reaction were recorded and analyzed. Analysis revealed that maximum inhibitor efficiency which corresponds to the lowest corrosion rate was obtained at optimum inhibitor volumes of 5 cm 3, with reduction in the corrosion rate observed to follow in order of increasing extract volumes. Adsorption study revealed that Temkin isotherm best described the metal surface interaction with the extract phytochemicals, with 12 minutes becoming the best exposure time for the phytochemicals to adsorb to the metal surface at all volumes. Statistical modelling of the corrosion rate yielded an important relationship suitable for estimating corrosion rate values once volumes of the extract is known. Microstructural studies, showed an indirect relationship between crack growth rates and extract volumes, while consistency of the irregular intermetallic phases increases with increasing extract volumes. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB &amp; PII.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to propose an obstacle avoidance method for service robots in indoor environments using vision and ultrasonic sensors. The service robot in this research is programmed to deliver a drinking cup to the recognized customer from a specified starting point. We have developed three main modules: one for face recognition, one to identify obstacles, and one to maneuver. The detection of static obstacles, which is based on information from the landmark, uses an edge-detection method and is used to generate a planned path. The speed, direction and distance of the moving obstacle are measured by using vision and distance sensors in order for the robot to make a maneuver. Algorithms for obstacle avoidance for service robots are proposed and a new geometrical model is introduced for service robots to make a good avoidance maneuver. The main aim of this research is to provide a complete mechanism for obstacle avoidance by a vision-based service robot, whereas popular obstacle avoidance methods such as PVM do not provide such a feature. We present the results of an experiment with a service robot in which our proposed method was implemented, after which we evaluate its performance.

AB  - A new procedure of space-time modeling through the Invers of Autocovariance Matrix (IAcM) is proposed. By evaluating the IAcM behaviors on behalf of the Generalized Space-Time Autoregressive (GSTAR) process stationarity, we may find an appropriate model to space-time data series. This method can complete the Space-Time ACF and PACF methods for identifying space-time models. For study case, we apply the GSTAR models to the monthly tea production of some plantations in West Java, Indonesia. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - Apatite-type lanthanum silicates show a great potential to be used as an electrolyte for intermediate-to low-temperature (600-700 °C) solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFC). However, so far these materials need to be prepared using a very high-temperature method, thus there is a growing interest to prepare apatites at lower temperatures. This paper reports the synthesis of undoped La9.33Si6O26 and doped apatites (La9CaSi6O26, 5, La9SrSi6O26, 5, and La9BaSi6O26, 5) from raw materials La2O3, Na2SiO4, BaCO3, CaCO3, and SrCO3 using a hydrothermal method. The polycrystalline apatites were obtained as a white powder, after the basic solution of the reagent mixture was heated at 240 °C in an autoclave for 3 days. Le Bail refinement of the X-ray powder diffraction data showed that the compounds have a hexagonal cell (P 63/m space group). In this paper, the undoped La9.33Si6O26 and La-doped apatite ionic conductivities are also presented. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - Based on small amplitude water theory we determine an exact solution for the amplitude of the reflected and transmitted waves produced when a monochromatic wave hits a submerged bar, a result of importance in coastal engineering. We compare the results obtained with results previously obtained in the long wave length limit and other numerical results. Using the results obtained we determine the optimal width or the bar of prescribed depth.

AB  - Magnetic properties of sediments from two different environmental settings in Indonesia have been studied using rock magnetic methods and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In the first setting, magnetic measurements were conducted on core sediments from two maar lakes in East Java (Lakes Lading and Bedali) that represent very confined environments where sediments are derived mainly from rocks and soils within the craters. In the second setting, similar measurements were obtained on core sediment from Lake Matano, a cryptodepression lake in tectonically active South Sulawesi where the area around the lake is dominated by highly magnetic lateritic soils. The results show that the predominant magnetic mineralogy in sediments from Lakes Lading, Bedali, as well as Matano is pseudo-single domain (PSD) magnetite (Fe3O4). Compared to that of Lake Matano, the maar lake sediments of Lakes Lading and Bedali have higher magnetic susceptibility as well as high intensity of ARM and SIRM. Variations in magnetic susceptibility in all core sediments are controlled mainly by the concentration of magnetic minerals. The homogeneity of magnetic minerals in these three lakes sediment provides an excellent setting for interpreting paleoclimatic signals as they will be recorded as anomalies of magnetic susceptibility.

AB  - This paper presents results of numerical and experimental study of shear link behavior, utilizing diagonal stiffener on web of steel profile to increase shear link performance in an eccentric braced frame (EBF) of a steel structure system. The specimen is to examine the behavior of shear link by using diagonal stiffener on web part under static monotonic and cyclic load. The cyclic loading pattern conducted in the experiment is adjusted according to AISC loading standards 2005. Analysis was carried out using non-linear finite element method using MSC/NASTRAN software. Link was modeled as CQUAD shell element. Along the boundary of the loading area the nodal are constraint to produce only one direction loading. The length of the link in this analysis is 400mm of the steel profile of WF 200.100. Important parameters considered to effect significantly to the performance of shear link have been analyzed, namely flange and web thicknesses, thickness and length of web stiffener, thickness of diagonal stiffener and geometric of diagonal stiffener. The behavior of shear link with diagonal web stiffener was compared with the behavior of standard link designed based on AISC 2005 criteria. Analysis results show that diagonal web stiffener is capable to increase shear link performance in terms of stiffness, strength and energy dissipation in supporting lateral load. However, differences in displacement ductility's between shear links with diagonal stiffener and shear links based on AISC standards have not shown to be significant. Analysis results also show thickness of diagonal stiffener and geometric model of stiffener to have a significant influence on the performance of shear links. To perform validation of the numerical study, the research is followed by experimental work conducted in Structural Mechanic Laboratory Center for Industrial Engineering ITB. The Structures and Mechanics Lab rotary PAU-ITB. The experiments were carried out using three test specimens with model and dimension identical to the model in the numerical study. Experimental testing apparently has shown results of the same behavior as predicted in the numerical study. However, when it is compared to the shape of the hysterical curve, a slight difference is apparent. This is due to the influence of stiffness of bolt joints and the supports which is difficult to model precisely in the numerical studies.

AB  - Aluminium pillared montmorillonites from Indonesian natural montmorillonite has been prepared using Al13 Keggin ion pillaring precursor in varied concentrations. Herein we studied their characterization and catalysis application for esterification reaction. X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX), and BET gas sorption analysis were employed to characterize the prepared materials besides the characterization on surface acidity by pyridine and n-butylammine adsorptions and FTIR analysis. The result showed that significant improvement on physicochemical character data was obtained by a pillarization process. Such a process also provided improvements on catalytic activities in esterification reactions. The effect of aluminium content on material characters was discussed in this paper. It was observed from the catalytic activity tests that pillared montmorillonite samples demonstrated higher activity in esterification reaction relative to the raw montmorillonite. It was found that surface profile of materials consist of specific surface area, pore volume and Lewis acidity were significantly affect the catalyst activity.

AB  - Integrated geoelectrical resistivity, hydrogeochemical and soil properties analysis methods were used to study the area that has been applied with fertilization for long duration and non-Fertilization in Machang, North Kelantan. The Machang plain is covered with Quaternary fluvial sediments overlying granite bedrock. The drainage system is dendritic with the main river flowing into the South China Sea. In this study, the area was divided into two sites. Site-1 is the non-fertilized site, and Site-2 is the regularly-fertilized site. At shallow depth from the surface to depths of 75 cm a lower average geoelectrical resistivity values were obtained from the regularly fertilized site which has not been fertilized for the last ten months prior to the survey. The average resistivity values were around 0.366 times less in unfertilized sites. Residual nitrate and chloride were still present at the regularly chemically fertilized sites. At sites where no chemical fertilizer was added, the nitrate and chloride concentration were also found. These are due to the faces excretion of from the farm animals. The presence of nitrate and chloride content in pore water reduced the resistivity values. Thus despite low moisture content, the resistivity values to remain low. Normally, resistivity values are inversely proportional to moisture content for area with similar soil condition.

AB  - Diffuse neutron scattering from powder KBr was measured at room temperature. The oscillatory diffuse scattering is clearly observed. The diffuse scattering theory including correlation effects among thermal displacements of atoms is applied to background function in the Rietveld analysis. The observed scattering data are analyzed by including the correlation effects among thermal displacements of first, second and third nearest neighboring atoms. The inter-atomic distance and temperature dependence of the values of correlation effects is discussed.

AB  - Comparing the quality of basic reservoir rock properties is a common practice to locate new infills or development wells for optimizing an oil field development using a reservoir simulation. The conventional technique employs a manual trial and error process to find new well locations, which proves to be time-consuming, especially, for a large field. Concerning this practical matter, an alternative in the form of a robust technique was introduced in order that time and efforts could be reduced in finding best new well locations capable of producing the highest oil recovery. The objective of the research was to apply Genetic Algorithm (GA) in determining wells locations using reservoir simulation to avoid the manual conventional trial and error method. GA involved the basic rock properties, i.e., porosity, permeability, and oil saturation, of each grid block obtained from a reservoir simulation model, which was applied into a newly generated fitness function formulated through translating the common engineering practice in the reservoir simulation into a mathematical equation and then into a computer program. The maximum of the fitness value indicated a final searching of the best grid location for a new well location. In order to evaluate the performance of the generated GA program, two fields that had different production profile characteristics, namely the X and Y fields, were applied to validate the proposed method. The proposed GA method proved to be a robust and accurate method to find the best new well locations for field development. The key success of this proposed GA method is in the formulation of the objective function. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - The price volatility and scarcity have been became a great problem in the distribution system of seasonal staple food produced by agro industry. It has salient supply disparity during the harvest and planting season. This condition could cause disadvantages to the stakeholders such as producer, wholesaler, consumer, and government. This paper proposes a buffer stock model under free trade considerations to substitute quantitative restrictions and tariffs by indirect market intervention instrument. The instrument was developed through buffer stock scheme in accordance with warehouse receipt system (WRS) and collateral management system. The public service institution for staple food buffer stock (BLUPP) is proposed as wholesaler's competitor with main responsibility to ensure price stabilization and availability of staple food. Multi criteria decision making is formulated as single objective a mixed integer non linear programming (MINLP). The result shows that the proposed model can be applied to solve the distribution problem and can give more promising outcome than its counterpart, the direct market intervention instrument. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - Properties of fresh concrete made in tropical countries, which is mixed, transported (with agitation), placed and initially cured in places where the temperature ranges from about 20°C to 40°C and relative humidity above 60%, are not completely understood. Applicable requirements also differ from country to country and government agencies and private enterprises have their own specifications. Assuming such temperature and relative humidity conditions, the present study is an attempt at evaluating the properties of hot weather concrete in fresh state with using a method of ready-mixed concrete. The fresh concrete was mixed and agitated at varying concrete and ambient temperatures. Three groups of the component materials, each material having such temperature as to bring resulting temperature of the fresh concrete to about 20°C, 30°C, 35°C, were chosen. The temperature of cement was conditioned to about20°, 40°C and 60°C for each of groups respectively. The aggregate was made warm enough to simulate the condition of outdoor pile in ready-mixed concrete plant. The temperature of tap water was always 20 ° C as it was easily controlled and unlikely affected by outdoor temperature. With the fresh concrete prevented from evaporation, slump loss is caused solely by increased temperature of concrete. During agitation, the slump loss increases rapidly during the first 30 minutes but moderately during the remaining period. Concrete-placing temperature (upon arrival at the work site) could be estimated by a proposed formula derived from this study. Besides the freshly mixed concrete temperature, this formula also takes into consideration the ambient temperature, agitating time in transit and hydration heat. The achievement as described in this study may be useful to control concrete quality in terms of strength, shrinkage and other properties of concrete to be placed in hot-humid environment. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB &amp; PII.

AB  - Cocoa pod (Theobroma cacao L.) hydrolysate was hydrolyzed into glucose using hydrochloric, sulphuric and nitric acids, respectively. The concentration of each acid was set at 0.25 M, 0.50 M, 0.75 M, 1.00 M and 1.25 M. They were treated under two different temperatures and time at 75 °C and 90 °C for 2 h and 4 h, respectively. The results showed that hydrolysis in 1.00 M of hydrochloric acid at 75 °C for 4 h had produced the highest glucose content of 30.7% w/v compared to all others acids treated under similar conditions. The pod's hydolysate was then fermented in batch culture using Saccharomyces cerevisiae for 48 h at 30 °C. A maximum ethanol production of 17.3%v/v was achieved after 26 h of fermentation time.

AB  - The sorption and the degradation capacity of natural estrogens in freshwater environmental system in Japan were performed. Batch experiments were examined in water-sediment suspensions using six layers of sediment under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The results indicated that the water-sediment partition coefficient of E1 (Kd E1) was higher than E2 (Kd E2). The degradation rate of E1 (kE1) was smaller than E2 (kE2). Under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, E1 was formed from E2. The degradation rate of E2 (kE2) from the surface to bottom of sediment layers was estimated fell in the range from 0.114 to 0.026 h-1 and 0.05 to 0.014 h-1 under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively.

AB  - Quinine is a natural alkaloid having a methoxy group bound to quinoline ring and an allyl group bound to quinuclidine ring. Demethylation of quinine applying strong acid such as HBr or HI at high temperature was unsuccessful. The aim of this research was to obtain demethylated quinine by means of mild and selective demethylation procedure to prevent the addition reaction of allyl group. Selective demethylation of quinine has been carried out using anhydrous aluminium trichloride as reagent. The demethylation product was achieved in 68.12% yield by mole ratio of quinine to anhydrous aluminium trichloride of 1 to 4 in dried methylene chloride under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction was firstly carried out at 0°C for 4 h and after the reaction mixture reached room temperature, the reaction was continued up to 24 h.

AB  - Laccase has been produced in a solid state fermentation (SSF) using white rot fungi and various lignocellulosic based substrates. White rot fungi used were Marasmius sp, Trametes hirsuta, Trametes versicolor and Phanerochaete crysosporium. The solid substrates employed in this research were collected from agriculture waste which were empty fruit bunches (EFB), rice straw, corn cob, and rice husk. The objective of this research was to determine the most promising fungus, the best solid substrate and the optimal conditions for the production of laccase. The results showed that Marasmius sp. on all solid substrates displayed higher laccase activity than that of any other strain of white rot fungi. Marasmius sp. and solid substrate of rice straw demonstrated the highest laccase activity of 1116.11 U/L on day 10. Three significant factors, i.e. pH, temperature and yeast extract concentration were studied by response surface method on laccase production using Marasmius sp and rice straw. The optimized conditions were pH, temperature and yeast extract concentration of 4.9, 31oC and 0.36 g/L respectively. The fermentation of Marasmius sp. in SSF on agricultural waste shows a great potential for the production of laccase. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB &amp; PII.

AB  - Continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) observations showed significant crustal displacements as a result of the Bengkulu earthquake occurring on September 12, 2007. A maximum horizontal displacement of 2.11 m was observed at PRKB station, while the vertical component at BSAT station was uplifted with a maximum of 0.73 m, and the vertical component at LAIS station was subsided by -0.97 m. The method of adding more constraint on the inversion for the Bengkulu earthquake slip distribution from GPS observations can help solve a least squares inversion with an under-determined condition. Checkerboard tests were performed to help conduct the weighting for constraining the inversion. The inversion calculation of the Bengkulu earthquake slip distribution yielded in an optimum value of slip distribution by giving a weight of smoothing constraint of 0.001 and a weight of slip value constraint = 0 at the edge of the earthquake rupture area. A maximum coseismic slip of the optimal inversion calculation was 5.12 m at the lower area of PRKB and BSAT stations. The seismic moment calculated from the optimal slip distribution was 7.14 × 1021 Nm, which is equivalent to a magnitude of 8.5. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - Observations and a linear wave model were used to evaluate the role of equatorial oceanic wave processes in affecting the evolution of the 2006 positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), focusing on the activation phase of the event. The observations indicate the presence of upwelling equatorial waves and westward near-surface zonal currents along the equator during the activation phase of the event in August 2006. These upwelling equatorial waves (negative sea surface height anomalies) and westward zonal current anomalies contributed to significant sea surface cooling in the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean. The model results reveal that the upwelling equatorial waves and westward near-surface zonal currents were mainly generated by wind-forced Kelvin waves associated with the easterly wind anomalies. On the other hand, anomalous easterly winds along the equator during June caused downwelling waves (positive sea surface height anomalies) in the off-equatorial region which propagated westward and elevated sea levels in the western region. The model further shows that a complex interplay of wind-forced and boundary-generated Rossby waves elevated sea levels in the western equatorial Indian Ocean during the activations phase of the 2006 IOD event. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - We have studied the preparation of organic-inorganic hybrid polymer precursors by sol-gel technique and their utilization for nanostructured optical components for photonic applications. The gel polymer precursors were prepared from siloxane modified by polymerizable acrylate groups, which can be processed further by photopolymerization process. Molecular structure characterizations by means of the FTIR measurements indicate the conversion of C=C bonds into C-C bonds after photopolymerization. This bond conversion produces high cross-linking between the organic and inorganic moieties, resulting in thermally stable and chemically resistant thin polymer layer which provide unique advantages of this material for particular optical/photonic applications. By employing laser interference technique, gratings with periodicity between 400-1000 nm have been successfully fabricated. Application of those sub-micron periodicity of grating structure as active elements in optically pumped polymer laser system and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) based measurement system have been also explored. The experimental results therefore also show the potential applications of this hybrid polymer as a building material for micro/nano-photonics components. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - Electrolyte polymer membrane widely used in PEMFC and DMFC is a perfluorosulfonated membrane such as Nafion. This membrane material exhibits good chemical stability and proton conductivity, but it is very expensive and difficult to recycle. It has high cross-over methanol in DMFC that causes the decrease efficiency and performance of fuel cell, so that the electrolyte polymer membrane with low cross-over methanol has been needed to substitute Nafion membrane. One of the materials used as a polymer electrolyte membrane is polyblends of a sulfonated polystyrene-lignosulfonate (SPS-LS). These polyblends have been prepared by casting polymer solution and characterized as a polyelectrolyte membrane for DMFC. SPS was prepared by sulfonation of polystyrene with acetyl sulfate used as a sulfonating agent. The membranes of SPS-LS were characterized by analysis of functional groups, mechanical properties, and methanol permeability. The maximum mechanical properties of the SPS-LS membrane were observed in LS ratio of 7.5%. However, the methanol permeability of membrane increases as the increase of LS ratio in SPS-LS membranes. The properties of membranes, especially the mechanical property and methanol permeability close to that of Nafion® 117 membrane, so the SPS-LS membrane is highly potential used as the electrolyte membrane for direct methanol fuel cell. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - Curcumin has been widely reported as an anti-inflammatory agent isolated from the plant Curcuma longa L. (turmeric). This anti-inflammatory activity was associated with the ability of this compound to inhibit the activity of both cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in arachidonic acid metabolism. Dual COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors are preferred to be employed in the therapy of chronic inflammatory diseases compared to selective inhibitors, since it was reported that the use of selective inhibitors led to severe adverse side effect. In the present study, in vitro and in silico assays on curcumin and its analogues as dual inhibitors for both COX-1 and COX-2 were performed. The results provide theoretical contribution in understanding the ligand-protein interactions at the molecular level to develop new curcumin analogues which possess better anti-inflammatory activity as well as to avoid unsolicited side effects.

AB  - Heavy metals content as well as magnetic and electrical properties of leachate from Sarimukti, West Java were studied in an attempt to seek correlation between heavy metals content and magnetic/electrical properties. Such correlation is expected to open the way for the use of magnetic/electrical properties as proxy indicators for the concentration of heavy metals in the leachate. The number of leachate samples studied is 21; 15 were taken spatially at depth of 1 m while the remaining 6 samples were taken vertically at a particular point. Measurement results showed that the heavy metals content in the leachate has a smaller concentration, except for Fe. The correlation between magnetic susceptibility and heavy metals content was found to be not so significant. The best correlation coefficient between magnetic susceptibility with heavy metals in leachate was found in Zn. Correlation between electrical conductivity and heavy metal is also not so significant, except for Zn and Cd. The use of magnetic properties as proxy indicator for heavy metals content in leachate is plausible provided that the magnetic susceptibility exceeds certain threshold value. Correlation between magnetic susceptibility, electrical conductivity and heavy metal content would be good if each quantity has a large value. © 2011 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - Synthesis of five layers Aurivillius phases, Pb2-xBi4+xTi5-xMnxO18 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) were carried out by molten salts method using eutectic mixture of Na2SO4/K2SO4 salts (1:1 molar ratio) as the flux. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction powder and refined by Le Bail technique. The refinement results revealed that the samples with composition x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 formed five layers Aurivillius with the space group B2cb; however, the samples with x = 0.4 and 0.6 contained impurity as BiMnO3 and the additional phase of four layers Aurivillius (PbBi4Ti4O15) was also observed for x = 0.6. The samples with x = 0.8 and 1 resulted in two phases: four layers Aurivillius and BiMnO3. The dielectric properties of the Pb2-xBi4+xTi5-xMnxO18 show broad peaks with the temperature of the maximum of the dielectric constant (Tm) at temperature of 295, 295, 304, and 343°C at a frequency of 2 MHz for x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6, respectively. The Tm of these samples is shift to the left with decreasing frequency as indication of relaxor ferroelectric behavior. The samples with x = 0.8 and 1 show anomaly at 514°C and 551°C which correspond to the transition phase of four layers Aurivillius. Magnetic properties for all samples containing Mn are paramagnetic.

AB  - Zirconia has been prepared from Zircon concentrate by caustic fusion methods. Zircon is a by product from tin ore concentration plant at Bangka island of Indonesia. Yttria Stabilized-Zirconia (YSZ) was prepared by introducing the 8 % mol yttrium oxide into zirconia and sintered at 1500 C for 5 hours. In order to obtain constant oxygen vacancy of 8 % mol in Zirconia, an appropriate amount of Yttria and Calcia were introduced into Zirconia and the mixtures were heated at 1350 °C for 5 hours. Elemental composition was determined by SEM/EDX and XRF and lattice parameters were determined using X-ray diffraction method. Ionic conductivity was measured by complex impedance spectroscopy. The results show that doping of Yttria into Zirconia (YSZ) and Calcia-Yttria into Zirconia (CYZ) allows phase transformation of Zirconia from tetragonal with space group P42/nmc into cubic Fm3m and enhance the ionic conductivity. However, the prepared materials are porous and have not met the requirement for the electrolyte material yet.

AB  - In addition to forest encroachment, forest fire is a serious problem in Indonesia. Attempts at managing its widespread and frequent occurrence has led to intensive use of remote sensing data. Coarse resolution images have been employed to derive hot spots as an indicator of forest fire. However, most efforts to verify the hot spot data and to verify fire accidents have been restricted to the use of medium or high resolution data. At present, it is difficult to verify solely upon those data due to severe cloud cover and low revisit time. In this paper, we present a method to validate forest fire using NDVI time series data. With the freely available NDVI data from SPOT VEGETATION, we successfully detected changes in time series data which were associated with fire accidents.

The objectives of this research are to identify physical parameters of gas transfer from a various type of packed wastes and examine ventilation design theory for landfill to enhance waste stabilization. Method to determine value of gas permeability and intrinsic permeability for packed waste is by flushing the packed column containing various type and physical characteristics of wastes with an air pump. Permeability was calculated by measuring pressure gradient on sampling points of the column using inclined manometer at distance 10 cm, 23 cm, 46 cm, 69 cm, 92 cm and 115 cm from origin. Gas permeability is specifically relied on physical parameters of wastes as follows, density, moisture content, particle size and gas velocity on the surface of compacted waste layer. Compost has finer pore structure and smaller pore size than leaves as well as mixed organic (65%) and inorganic wastes (35%). The experiment found the intrinsic permeability of leaves waste are in the order of 10-11 to 10-8 m2, 10-11 to 10-9 m2 for compost and 10-9 m2 for mixed organic (65%) and inorganic wastes (35%).

AB  - In many industrial plants, some key variables cannot always be measured on-line and for the purpose of control, an alternative of sensing system is required. This paper is concerned with a development of an alternative intelligent control strategy, which is an integration between the neuro-fuzzy based controller and virtual sensing system. This allows an immeasurable variable to be inferred and used for control. The virtual sensor is composed of the Diagonal Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) for plant modeling and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) as the estimator with inputs from DRNN. The integration between virtual sensor and the controller enables a development of an on-line control scheme involving the immeasurable variable. The real-time implementation demonstrates the applicability and the performance of the proposed intelligent control scheme, especially in dealing with nonlinear processes.

AB  - In this paper we discuss a mathematical model for the transmission of Lymphatic Filariasis disease in Jati Sampurna, West Java Indonesia. The model assumes that acute infected humans are infectious and treatment is given to a certain number of acute infected humans found from screening process. The treated acute individuals are assumed to be remain susceptible to the disease. The model is analyzed and it is found a condition for the existence and stability of the endemic equilibrium. A well known rule of thumb in epidemiological model, that is, the endemic equilibrium exists and stable if the basic reproduction number is greater than one, is shown. Moreover, it is also shown that if the level of screening n is sufficiently large, current medical treatment strategy will be able to reduce the long-term level of incidences. However, in practice it is not realistic and cannot eliminate the disease, in terms of reducing the basic reproduction number. The reproduction number can be reduced by giving additional treatments, such as reducing the biting rate and mosquito's density. This suggests that there should be a combination of treatment to eliminate the disease.

AB  - The present study is an attempt to introduce a method for optimizing the geometry of a unit process. The comprehensive unit process performances are generated by a CFD engine. The CFD engine can simulate the unit process performances at whatever conditions. Both design geometry and operating variables were used on the CFD simulation. The burden on a simplified process was taken out from CFD simulation. A complex geometry of a unit process is represented by a secondary reformer. A secondary reformer has a conical chamber as a space to undergo a combustion reaction before entering a catalyst bed. This complexity is added by the boundary on a porous solid surface as the top surface of the catalyst bed. The conical angle affects the flow pattern inside the conical chamber having a porous solid surface as its base. The conical angle above 65° results the disappearing of the recirculation flow. The inlet distance from the porous solid surface also can exhibit different characteristics of recirculation flow. The closer the distance to the porous solid surface, the stronger the recirculation is. The inlet velocity values have no significant effect on the flow pattern. The introduction of a solid volume inside the geometry creates distortion in the flow pattern. In the application, the inserted solid volume is equivalent to a burner. It means that the use of the burner inherently produces some problems of the flow distribution.

AB  - Although mangrove is one of important ecosystems in the world, it has been abused and exploited by human for various purposes. Monitoring mangrove is therefore required to maintain a balance between economy and conservation and provides up-to-date information for rehabilitation. Optical remote sensing data have delivered such information, however ever-changing atmospheric disturbance may significantly decrease thematic content. In this research, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) fully polarimetric data were evaluated to present an alternative for mangrove mapping. Assessment using three statistical trees was performed on both tonal and textural data. It was noticeable that textural data delivered fairly good improvement which reduced the error rate to around 5-6% at L-band. This suggests that insertion of textural data is more important than any information derived from decomposition algorithm.

AB  - Carbon Nanotubes research is one of the top five hot research topics in physics since 2006 because of its unique properties and functionalities, which leads to wide-range applications. One of the most interesting potential applications is in term of nanoelectronic device. Carbon nanotubes heterojunction has been modeled, which was built from two different carbon nanotubes, that one is metallic and the other one is semiconducting. There are two different carbon nanotubes metal-semiconductor heterojunction. The first one is built from CNT(10,10) as metallic carbon nanotube and CNT (17,0) as semiconductor carbon nanotube. The other one is built from CNT (5,5) as metallic carbon nanotube and CNT (8,0). All of the semiconducting carbon nanotubes are assumed to be a pyridine-like N-doped. Those two heterojunctions are different in term of their structural shape and diameter. It has been calculated their charge distribution and potential profile, which would be useful for the simulation of their electronic transport properties. The calculations are performed by using self-consistent method to solve Non-Homogeneous Poisson's Equation with aid of Universal Density of States calculation method for Carbon Nanotubes. The calculations are done by varying the doping fraction of the semiconductor carbon nanotubes The electron tunneling transmission coefficient, for low energy region, also has been calculated by using Wentzel-Kramer-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. From the calculation results, it is obtained that the charge distribution as well as the potential profile of this device is doping fraction dependent.

AB  - Total soluble solids (TSS) and fruit fresh weight are two indicators to show the quality of tomato fruits. To gain high values of TSS and fruit fresh weight, it is important to consider the concentration of nutrient solution, which is commonly represented by Electrical Conductivity (EC) value. Generally, the increasing of EC value not only increases the number of TSS, but also decreases fruit fresh weight. Therefore, it is important to optimize the EC value for both indicators of quality of tomato fruits. The objective of this research is to optimize the EC value of nutrient solution on each generative stage using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Algorithms (GA). ANN was used to identify the relationship between different EC value treatments with TSS value and fruit fresh weight. GA was applied to determine the optimal EC value in generative growth, which is divided into three stages. Results showed that the optimal EC values in the flowering stage, the fruiting stage and the harvesting stage were 1.4 mS/cm, 10.2 mS/cm and 9.7 mS/cm, respectively.

AB  - In this study, we have conducted a crosshole tomography survey to obtain seismic data from two boreholes on the ITB campus. The first borehole was 39 meters deep while the second was 19 meters deep. The aim of the study was to determine the subsurface velocity and Q-factor for the region between the two boreholes for geotechnical purposes. Sources of seismic waves were produced by an impulse generator and sparker and were recorded by 12 channels of borehole hydrophones. In the tomography inversion, the pseudo-bending ray tracing method was employed to calculate travel times. The initial velocity model was a 1-D model with 1x1 m2 block dimensions. The non-linear inversion problem was solved by delay-time tomography with the LSQR method. Also, a checkerboard resolution test (CRT) was conducted to evaluate the resolution of the tomography inversion. Using the velocity structure results, a LSQR Q-tomography inversion was carried out using spectral curve fitting to obtain the attenuation structure (t* values). The resulting tomogram shows that there are 3 layers, with an unconsolidated layer (down to 8 meters), a consolidated layer (from 8 meters deep to 20 meters), and bedrock (more than 20 meters). From the results, the ground water level is estimated at a depth of 14 meters. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Oxygen plays an important role in the metabolism of cells inside the human body. The transfer of oxygen from blood to tissue takes place in capillaries through a diffusion process. The capillary-tissue region is usually represented by the so-called Krogh cylinder model, in which the distribution of the oxygen concentration in a tissue region leads to a diffusion equation with oxygen consumption rates following the Michaelis-Menten kinetics. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to the steady state case and solve the equation analytically by means of asymptotic expansion for a particular limit of the oxygen consumption rate. Results show that there exists a critical ratio between supply and consumption of oxygen in the tissue region in order to fulfill the cell's oxygen requirements. Above from this critical ratio, we also found a critical distance in the tissue region above which the oxygen concentration vanishes. We compared our asymptotic results with numerical simulations, which turned out to be quite in agreement. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - The storage effects on the oxidation characteristics of fatty acid methyl ester of canola oil (CME) were investigated in this study.CME stabilised with two antioxidants, i.e.2,6-di-tert-bytyl-p-cresol (BHT) and 6,6-di-tert-butyl- 2, 2'-methylendi-p-cresol (BPH), was stored at 20, 40 and 60°C.The oxidation stability data were measured by the Rancimat test method and it was found that both BHT and BPH addition increased the oxidation resistance of the CME. The results showed that when BPH or BHT was added at a concentration of 100 ppm, the oxidation induction period of the neat CME samples increased from 5.53 h to 6.93 hand 6.14h, respectively. Comparing both antioxidants, BPH proved to be more effective in increasing the oxidation resistance when both antioxidants were added at the same concentration. Furthermore, the oxidation induction time decreased linearly with the storage time. It was shown that the oxidation occurred rapidly in the first 8 weeks of storage. Later, a kinetic study was undertaken and first-order kinetics were applied to explain the oxidation characteristics of the CME added with antioxidants. This kinetic study focused on exploiting the activation energy values obtained from the Arrhenius equations. Also, the oxidation effects on other quality parameters, including acid value, peroxide value, kinematic viscosity, and water content, were examined. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - In this work we have investigated mixing in a modified orbiting screw mixer (MOSM) designed for solid-solid mixing. Mixing was carried out using urea powder and natural zeolite powder (UZ) of three varying particle sizes (50- 60, 60-80 and 80 mesh). Power consumption was calculated from the measured torque of orbit and screw, obtained from computerized records. It was found that the mixing process in the modified orbiting screw mixer with air injection required a lower power consumption for each particle-size group when compared to mixing without air injection. With UZ mixing in MOSM with air injection, the lowest E was obtained for the 60-80 mesh particle-size group (4,297 Joule/kg-1), whereas when mixing without air injection, the value was 10,296 J/kg. The best mixing operation in this experiment was achieved at NFr = 1.18x10-3 and in the range of values NRe ≈ 8.77x107 to 2.63x108. Moreover, in this study, we have developed an equation to estimate the power consumption required for mixing and determined its correlation with dimensionless numbers. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - A series of tris(β-diketonato)zirconium(IV) complexes was immobilized into a synthetic clay structure of Taeniolite by an ion-exchange method to generate organic/inorganic hybrid compounds. The hybrid compound served as a good catalyst for ring-opening reactions of methyl, ethyl, and dimethyl oxiranes with various alcohols to generate primary alkoxy alcohols in appreciable selectivity. This method describes a technique to immobilize cationic zirconium complexes without losing selectivity. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by hypergly-cemic episodes. One approach for controlling hyperglycemia is to use natural compounds derived from plants, such as Sansevieria trifasciata leaves, which are presumed to contain hypoglycemic agents. Sansevieria trifasciata leaves are widely used by the Sabah community in Malaysia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a decoction of Sansevieria trifasciata leaves on blood glucose levels and the density of granules in pancreatic β cells in alloxan-induced hyperglycemic rats. This study used a completely randomized design and 30 male Wistar rats that were 2 months old, and had a body weight in the range of 150-200 gram. The rats were divided into a group of normal rats as the control group and five groups of alloxan-induced hyperglycemic rats, each with 5 animals per group. The five groups of hyperglycemic rats were administered by aquadest, respectively: saline, as a diabetic control; 5mg/kg bw glibenclamide; 100 mg/kg bw, 150 mg/kg bw, and 200 mg/kg bw of the S.trifasciata leaf decoction, using 1 ml per 200 g body weight for 30 days. Histological examination of the pancreas was performed by paraffin section and Victoria Blue staining. The results of this study show that all doses of the Sansevieria trifasciata leaves decoction decreased the level of blood glucose and increased the granule density in the β cells of the islets of Langerhans of the alloxan-induced hyperglycemic (diabetic) rats. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - A neurodegenerative disorder caused by oxidative stress leads to an accumulation of α-synuclein on neurons. Here, we report our findings on the effect of rotenone on the increase of oxidative stress and accumulation of α-synuclein in the midbrain of Wistar rats. Thirty six male rats (8-9 weeks, 200-250 g) were divided into three groups: the Blank group, the Solvent-rotenone group (intraperitoneally injected with 1 ml/kg body weight of sunflower seed oil), and the Rotenone group (intraperitoneally injected with 2.5 mg/kg body weight of rotenone) for 9, 19, and 28 days. The rats were decapitated on day 10 for the 9-day treatment, day 20 for the 19-day treatment, day 30, 40, 50 and 60 for the 28-day treatment (2 rats/group or 6 rats/day of observation time). The midbrains were isolated and extracted. Glutathione assay and α-synuclein ELISA tests were performed. The results showed that the average oxidative stress index was highest in the Blank group (0.95 ± 0.24, 0.63 ± 0.23, 0.81 ± 0.27, respectively). Meanwhile, the concentration of α-Synuclein had decreased in all groups (0.09 ± 0.03, 0.15 ± 0.03, and 0.13 ± 0.02 ng/mg tissue, respectively). Correlation analysis showed that the oxidative stress index was inversely proportional to the concentration of α-synuclein. Our conclusion is that the midbrain of Wistar rats treated with rotenone indicated oxidative stress and led to an accumulation of α-synuclein protein. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - Trypsin is supposed to play an important role in the internalization of the influenza virus into host cells in vitro because of its protease activity. The purpose of this study is to determine the role of trypsin in the internalization process of the influenza H1N1 virus in Vero and MDCK (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney) cells; to see whether trypsin can trigger the endocytosis route via receptor-mediated endocytosis or non-receptor-mediated endocytosis. The viruses were inoculated into Vero and MDCK cells under three conditions: (1) without trypsin in the medium (VVi and MVi); (2) with medium containing trypsin (VTVi1 and MTVi1); and (3) cells washed with trypsin prior to virus inoculation and incubated with medium containing trypsin (VTVi2 and MTVi2). Advance cytopathic effects (CPE) could only be observed in the MDCK cells. HA (hemagglutination) titer on the MDCK cells was higher than that on the Vero cells. Moreover, HA titer on MTVi1 was higher than MVi, and the lowest was found on MTVi2. Trypsin supported the internalization of the influenza virus by the cleavage of HA glycoprotein into HA1 and HA2. However, trypsin could halt the internalization of the influenza virus when the MDCK cells were washed with trypsin before virus inoculation. Trypsin could digest transmembrane protein containing sialic acid that is important for the virus internalization. Conversely, trypsin did not affect the internalization of the influenza virus in the Vero cells based on HA titer. This result was also supported by TEM observation, which showed that the ability of Vero cellsto internalize the influenza virus is very low. We suggest that a limited amount of sialic acid (α-2,6)-containing receptor on the membrane of the Vero cells can halt influenza virus internalization. On the other hand, active internalization of the virus was seen in all groups of MDCK cells (MVi, MTVi1, and MTVi2). However, trypsin could not trigger the internalization of the influenza virus in Vero and MDCK cells via non-receptor-mediated endocytosis. From this study it can be concluded that trypsin enhanced the internalization of influenza virus into MDCK cells by cleavage of the hemagglutinin (HA) of the virus, but did not improve the ability of the host cells to internalize the virus, especially via non-receptor-mediated endocytosis. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - 2-methoxyethanol is known as a chemical pollutant that is teratogenic or embryotoxic in animals and humans. 2-ME and its metabolites can damage cells and tissues in the body. Investigation of protein expression due to 2-ME was performed using primary antibodies Vimentin and GFAP. The amount of protein expressed was measured by immunodot blot and densitometry techniques. The results show that the average total change in Vimentin protein levels was higher (22.24% at gestation day 17 and 18) than in GFAP protein levels (15.10% on gestation day 12) in the treatment group. The 2-ME disrupted translation of Vimentin and increased the level of GFAP expression due to the cellular response to toxic materials. It can be concluded that the Vimentin protein is essential for the development of the brain, especially to stimulate cell proliferation for cell repair. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - The capacities of glucose in the decolorization process of an azo dye, Reactive Black 5 (RB5), by two white rot basidiomycetes, Pleurotus sp. F019 and Trametes sp. F054 were investigated. The results indicated that the dye degradation by the two fungi was extremely correlated with the presence of glucose in the culture and the process of fungi growth. Decolorization of 200 mg dye/l was increased from 62% and 69% to 100% within 20-25 h with the increase of glucose from 5 to 15 g/l, and the activity of manganese dependent peroxidase (MnP) increased by 2-9 fold in this case. Hydrogen peroxide of 0.55 mg/l and 0.43 mg/l were detected in 10 h in Pleurotus sp. F019 and Trametes sp. F054 cultures. © 2011 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - This paper presents an improvement model of the effective moment of inertia to predict the short term deflection of reinforced lightweight concrete beam. The models were developed using 9 beams of reinforced pumicelightweight concrete tested under two symmetrical-point loads. The presence of steel reinforcement in the beam was taken into consideration in the developed model. The models were verified by test carried out on other 9 beams. Those beams subjected to various-point loads and compressive strength. The results of investigation revealed that crack moment of inertia increased with the increased tensile reinforcement ratio. Thus, the reinforcement ratio significantly affects the value of effective moment of inertia of reinforced lightweight concrete beam. All the beam test results produced considerable deflection in comparison to that obtained using current Codes either ACI or SNI. The proposed model demonstrated a good agreement to the experimental results and in some cases have similar trend to that of the ACI or SNI prediction. © 2011 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - Kaolin has been identified as a potential raw material for the production of γ-Al 2 O 3 for hydrotreating catalyst support. This work explores the technical feasibility of applying the potassium hydroxide (KOH) extraction synthesis route on kaolin from the Belitung Island in Indonesia. The application of a published synthesis method to Belitung kaolin requires an approximately twofold increase in kaolin calcination time, an increase in kaolin calcinations temperature from 950 to 1000°C, and a tenfold increase in metakaolin extraction time, to obtain a specific surface area higher than 200 m 2 /g. The highest specific surface area of 233 m 2 /g was obtained when the kaolin was calcined at 1000°C for 24 hours, and the metakaolin was extracted by concentrated KOH solution for 12 hours. Phase characterization of the final product confirmed the formation of γ-Al 2 O 3 , but with the inclusion of low-surface area α-Al 2 O 3 phase.

AB  - The problem of output regulation of affine nonlinear systems with the relative degree not well defined by modified steepest descent control is studied. The modified steepest descent control is a dynamic feedback control which is generated by the trajectory following method. By assuming the system is minimum phase, output of the system can be regulated globally asymptotically.

AB  - Pt-Ni/C alloy nanocatalysts synthesized by polyol method with different atomic ratio are investigated to enhance activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for fuel cell applications. Prepared catalysts are characterized by various techniques, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDX), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). XRD analysis shows that all prepared catalysts with different atomic ratio exhibit face centered cubic and have smaller lattice parameters than pure Pt catalyst. The mean particle size of the catalysts are between 4.3 to 6.3 nm. Cyclic voltammograms with scan rate 5 mV s-1 at 25°C obtain range the electrochemical active surface (EAS) between 40 to 164 cm2/mgPt, mass activity (MA) and specific activity (SA) of nanocatalysts PtNi/C in the potential range 900 mV versus RHE between 3.61 to 8.42 mA/mgPt, and 0.05 to 0.09.

AB  - The effectiveness of a breakwater can be measured by quantifying the transmission coefficient (KT). The smaller the coefficient, the better the performance of the breakwater. A physical modeling on the proposed breakwater was conducted to identify the coefficient of Perforated Skirt Breakwater (PSB). The PSB model was tested in 2-D wave flume at Ocean Wave Research Laboratory FTSL ITB, to obtain the effectiveness of PSB for short-period waves (prototype periods, Tp= 4 second and smaller). The scaling of PSB models applies the principle of Froude Similarity, where the Froude number in model equals to the Froude number in prototype (Frm=Frp). The flume is equipped with 5 resistance-type wave probes and 8-channel DAS (Data Acquisition System). Wave heights (H) and wave periods (T) data were observed both manually by visual observation and wave probes readings (processed later with method of "zero mean up-crossing" technique). The incoming wave heights (Hi) and transmitted wave heights (Ht) were measured and processed to obtain the transmission coefficient (KT). The relationships between KT and non-dimensional variables (skirt draft/incident wave height, S/Hi) are analyzed and the calculated effectiveness of the PSB for varied environmental condition is obtained to be up to 70%.

AB  - Sr/Ca has been analyzed from coral core from the Seribu Islands reef complex i.e Jukung Island. SST from ERSST dataset and air temperature measured at Jakarta is used for Sr/Ca calibration. The results show that Jukung Island coral Sr/Ca correlates better with SST than with air temperature. A comparison between the Sr/Ca records with the Nino 3.4 index shows that Jukung coral sites indicate warming sea surface temperatures during the beginning of El Nino events followed by cooling temperatures at the end of El Nino years.

AB  - This paper presents the closed form solution of the synchronous machine transients undergoing short circuit. That analytic formulation has been derived based on linearity and balanced conditions of the fault. Even though restrictive, the proposed method will serve somehow or other as a new resource for EMTP productivity. Indisputably superior, the closed-form formulation has some features inimitable by discretization such as continuity, accuracy and absolute numerical stability. Moreover, it enables us to calculate states at one specific instant independent of previous states or a snapshot, which any discretization methods cannot do.

AB  - We report the fabrication of microporous filter for use in filtering both inorganic and organic substances from liquid materials. Titania (TiO2) anatase was used as the main material for this filter. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) with average molecular weight of 20,000 was also used as additive to control the formation of pores, especially pore sizes. The mixture of titania and PEG was pressed into cylindrical tablet shape at room temperature and then simply heated inside a furnace up to temperature where the PEG decomposed into gas to leave only connected titania particles. The use of titania as base material for the filter allows the organic substances that trapped inside the filter pores to be easily removed by heating up the used filter at above decomposition temperature of the trapped organics. We also made other filter by adding small amount of silica (SiO2) particles to reduce the size of the pores as well as to improve the mechanical strength. We observed that filters containing silica particles, with smaller in size compared to titania, resulted in better mechanical strength, smaller in pore sizes and better filtering results in term of turbidity and dissolved oxygen (DO) content. This method is potential for development of larger scale and cheaper water filters for use in various applications.

AB  - We present a progress report on the development of information system of lunar crescent astronomical observations which will be largely accessible for public domain. This consists of calculations of the Moon's ephemeris as well as systematic real-time lunar crescent observations. A well suited small telescope, equipped with a simple digital detector, is connected to a server to provide information on lunar crescent observations. The system has been used and worked well. The only constraint is poor weather condition. Network of small telescopes, installed at various locations in Indonesia, are currently planned to provide plethora of data. In the long term, this will be used to help to determine the astronomical visibility criteria of lunar crescent for Islamic calendar.

AB  - Laccase of Polyporus sp. S133 was able to oxidize most of the 3 different rings amount polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) tested. Phenanthrene was removed by 89% followed by chrysene and benzo[a]pyrene which were oxidized by 66 and 55%, respectively. Addition of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) to the reaction mixture increased oxidation of PAHs, especially phenanthrene was almost completely removed from the reaction mixture. Oxidation of chrysene and benzo[a]anthracene increased 12 and 10% with the mediator to 78 and 65% in the presence of HBT. PAH- quinones as oxidation products were formed from all PAH to different extents. A part of PAH was polymerized in the laccase/mediator system to products of weight-average molecular weight (MW). The correlation of the ionization potentials of PAH with the oxidation of these compounds is limited to the alternating PAH.

AB  - The modern food industry and a variety of food products require tolerant starch as raw material for processing in a broad range of techniques, from preparation to storage and distribution. Dual modification of arrowroot starch using hydroxypropylation and cross-linking was carried out to overcome the lack of native arrowroot starch in food processing application. The modifications applied were: combined propylene oxide (8%, 10%, and 12%); sodium tri meta phosphate/STMP (1%, 2%, and 3%); and sodium tri poly phosphate/STPP (4%, 5%, and 6%). These modifications significantly affected the composition of the amylose and amylopectin and the amount of phosphorus in the granules. Higher amounts of phosphate salt gave a higher phosphorus content, which increased the degree of substitution (DS) and the degree of cross-link. Arrowroot starch that was modified using a concentration of 8-10% propylene oxide and 1-2% STMP: 3-5% STPP produced a starch with < 0.4% phosphorus content. A higher concentration of propylene oxide provided a higher degree of hydroxypropyl. The changed physical properties of the modified granular arrowroot starch were examined through SEM testing, and its changed crystalline patterns through X-ray diffraction measurements. Especially, provision of a high concentration of propylene oxide (12%) combined with 3% STMP: 6% STPP affected the granular morphology and the crystallinity. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In an orthotropic material, the grain angle has a significant influence on its mechanical properties. The aim of this research was to perform a numerical simulation using a nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) to obtain the compression strength of the Red Meranti (shorea spp.) timber species at an angle to the grain ranging from 12° to 80°. The material properties needed for the analysis were obtained from clear specimen tests. To investigate the validity of the numerical results, various cross grain specimens were tested under uniaxial compressive stress. It has been shown in this study that an FEA based on the distortion energy of an orthotropic material can be used to obtain the compressive strength at proportional limit for cross grain specimens. Comparison with the experimental results showed that for a cross grain angle between 12° and 80° the FEA predicted the strength to be 9.4% to 33.6% lower than the experimental results. Compared to using Hankinson's formula to predict the compressive strength at a cross grain angle, using the FEA always gave a lower value, ranging from 13.2% to 30.5%. Based on these results, an FEA incorporating Hill's yield criterion is a conservative method for predicting compressive strength at an angle to the grain. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Zeolite loaded with alkylsilane-covered titanium oxide was found to be more effective than its nonporous silica counterpart as phase-boundary catalyst (PBC) to promote epoxidation of alkenes with aqueous hydrogen peroxide. It was demonstrated that the phase-boundary catalyst system required neither stirring to make an emulsion, nor addition of a cosolvent to make a homogeneous solution to drive the reaction. However, some basic facts about them remain unclear, such as the question as to where an effective location of the active sites of PBC resides: is it on the external surface of the catalysts, or in their pores? In order to elucidate this problem, TS-1, HZSM-5 and zeolite loaded with alkylsilane-covered sulfonic acid in which the location of the active sites is mainly inside the pore system, were chosen as model catalysts. Catalytic activities of the catalysts TS-1 and HZSM-5 were examined after modification with n-octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODS). Their activities were compared with zeolite loaded with alkylsilane-covered titanium oxide particles, in which the active sites are on the external surface in reactions of 1-octene with aqueous H2O2 and cyclohexene with water as model reactions. The study suggests that the location of the active sites on the external surface plays an important role in the phenomenon of phase-boundary catalysis. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - The magnetic states of Cobalt ions in magnetic thermoelectric materials of Bi1.5Pb0.5Ca2-zYzCo2 O8 (z = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) have been studied from the structural (X-ray diffraction) and magnetic susceptibility data. The misfit structure was revealed from refinement of the XRD data, with reduction of the lattice parameters while increasing the Y doping content. Compared with the (Bi,Pb)2Sr2Co2O8 parent compound system, the lattice parameter c was reduced significantly, while the misfit degree remained almost the same. The analysis of the magnetic data shows that the Cobalt ions are coupled antiferromagnetically within the CoO2 layers, with the existence of mixed valence states between Co3+ and Co4+ ions. Besides that, the effective magnetic moments of Cobalt ions are almost constant along the Y doping content. Assuming the orbital quenching as commonly found in most transition metal ions, the data are best fitted by taking the low-spin state of Co3+ ions and intermediate spin state of Co4+ ions. We argue qualitatively, that the spin-state transition across the gap are induced by the shrinkage of the charge transfer energy gaps between O 2p and Co eg levels due to reduction of the ionic spaces between Co and O ions. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - The governing equations describing methane oxidation in a reverse flow reactor are given by a set of convective-diffusion equations with a nonlinear reaction term, where temperature and methane conversion are dependent variables. In this study, the process is assumed to be a one-dimensional pseudohomogeneous model and takes place with a certain reaction rate in which thewhole process ofthereactor is still workable. Thus, the reaction rate can proceed at a fixed temperature. Under these conditions, we can restrict ourselves to solving the equations for the conversion only. From the available data, it turns out that the ratio of the diffusion term to the reaction term is small. Hence, this ratio is considered as a small parameter in our model and this leads to a singular perturbation problem. Numerical difficulties will be found in the vicinity of a small parameter in front of a higher order term. Here, we present an analytical solutionby means of matched asymptotic expansions. The result shows that, up to and including the first order of approximation, the solution is in agreement with the exact and numerical solutions of the boundary value problem. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - An approximate solution of longitudinal dispersion phenomena occurring in two phase miscible fluid flow through porous media has been obtained by using the group theoretic approach. The longitudinal dispersion coefficient is assumed to be directly proportional to the concentration of the fluid for a distance x and at any time t > 0. The graphical representation for the concentration of the fluid for a distance x and at time t > 0 has been obtained using Mat lab coding. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - The study of land degradation in various geographic conditions in the world using remote sensing is still become a concern amongst researchers because it has been proven as one of the most effective ways. In Indonesia, East Kalimantan province is one of the experiencing land area degradation due to intensive exploitation of natural resouces since 1970. The degradation model proposed in this study is modeled using a combination of ASTER and Landsat ETM+ imagery, both taken on February 27, 2001. The model composed of both two aspects: erosion aspect and vegetation aspect. Vegetation aspect is a function of suppression of vegetation from Crippen and Blom method and spectral angle a of Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) algorithm. The erosion aspect is calculated from erosion prediction and depends on the constant factors of b as well, and the latter is said as a function of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) value. Based on the validation using spectral based degradation map and Land Degradation Index of Chikhaoui et al, our model proves the ability to map land degradation, especially to better distinguish the classification of land degradation at very-slightly to very-severe intensity and the ability to differentiate water body, swamp or river.

AB  - Rice fields in Java, Indonesia have been in tremendous threat due to land policy weaknesses. In order to ensure food supply, satellite-based monitoring scheme has been chosen to accommodate quick data acquisition for agriculture planning. Nonetheless, detailed rice field map is lacking and it should be taken in consideration. WorldView-2 has the highest ground resolution to date, which is suitable to construct new rice distribution map in Indonesia. This paper shows that panchromatic data of the sensor have capability in identification of fragmented rice fields and clearly showed galengans. Red edge and Coastal bands introduced by WorldView-2 were found substantial to rice growth discrimination. In addition, various rice growth periods were detectable which helped to create of rice status map at appropriate accuracy. Copyright © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - Detailed investigations of landslides are essential to understand fundamental landslide mechanisms. Seismic refraction method has been proven as a useful geophysical tool for investigating shallow landslides. The objective of this study is to introduce a new workflow using neural network in analyzing seismic refraction data and to compare the result with some methods; that are general reciprocal method (GRM) and refraction tomography. The GRM is effective when the velocity structure is relatively simple and refractors are gently dipping. Refraction tomography is capable of modeling the complex velocity structures of landslides. Neural network is found to be more potential in application especially in time consuming and complicated numerical methods. Neural network seem to have the ability to establish a relationship between an input and output space for mapping seismic velocity. Therefore, we made a preliminary attempt to evaluate the applicability of neural network to determine velocity and elevation of subsurface synthetic models corresponding to arrival times. The training and testing process of the neural network is successfully accomplished using the synthetic data. Furthermore, we evaluated the neural network using observed data. The result of the evaluation indicates that the neural network can compute velocity and elevation corresponding to arrival times. The similarity of those models shows the success of neural network as a new alternative in seismic refraction data interpretation. © 2011 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - Hierarchically porous MFI zeolites (ZSM-5) have been synthesized by hydrothermal treatment in the presence of trialkoxysilylated-derivatives of nonionic poly(oxyethylene) alkyl ether or alkyl quaternary ammonium cation as mesopore-generating agent, along with tetrapropylammonium cation as zeolite structure-directing agent. Powder X-ray diffraction revealed that zeolites have been crystallized, and scanning electron microscopy showed rugged surface morphology that was quite different from conventional ZSM-5. The mesoporosity was confirmed by nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement showing type IV isotherms with narrow distribution of mesopore diameters. The catalytic activity of these mesoporous ZSM-5 was tested in liquid-phase esterification of benzyl alcohol with hexanoic acid. The conversion of benzyl alcohol on mesoporous ZSM-5 prepared via cationic-templating route was almost 100%, being much higher than on mesoporous ZSM-5 prepared with silylated nonionic surfactant as well as on conventional ZSM-5 with no mesopores. The presence of Brønsted acid sites, together with the mesopores, was responsible for this catalytic conversion, as confirmed by pyridine adsorption monitored by in situ infrared and 27 Al magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

AB  - This paper demonstrates a new alternative way in estimating seismically thin-bed (below-tuning) thickness. Initial thickness is built by bandpass filtering the amplitude display of a zero-phase seismic. The filter removes the non minimum and or non maximum and left the maximum and or the minimum of seismic amplitude. The unresolved below-tuning thickness is then corrected by zero-INTENS-difference (z-i-d) attribute. INTENS is integrated energy spectra, an attribute which can be derived from spectral analysis. z-i-d attribute is zero difference of INTENS between the seismic and its synthetic. The method generates INTENS difference profile by subtracting seismic INTENS and its synthetic INTENS iteratively. The iteration is controlled by dipole space shifting from distance to closer or vice versa. The true thickness is derived by locating z-i-d which laid in INTENS different profile. It has found that, for free noise true seismic and perfect-wavelet (a wavelet which only approximately similar with wavelet which constructing the true seismic) synthetic seismic, in INTENS different profile, the z-i-d location always corresponds to true dipole space or thickness. The method could resolve all thickness of a wedge-modeled seismic with three different dominant frequencies. When the synthetic seismic is constructed with imperfect wavelet, slightly different analysis is needed to locate z-i-d attribute and the result is not as perfect as when perfect wavelet constructing synthetic seismic. A quiet similar result is got when the method is implemented for noisy wedge-modeled seismic. Bad thickness estimation is resulted for 20% noise seismic. The method algorithm is extended for similar dipole polarity model and multilayer model to bring the method to real seismic data nearer. The extension is done by estimating thickness of every layer of a stacked-wedge-modeled seismic. The algorithm then generalized for estimating layers thickness with several thickness combinations. The method was able to delineate shallow channel of Stratton Field by providing good pseudo-acousticimpedance (pseudo AI) map.

AB  - Agglomeration of granulated Buton natural asphalt during storage is of major concern in its large-scale commercial application. This work develops a simple test method to evaluate the performance of agglomeration-resistant coating for granulated Buton asphalt, consisting of water-based polymeric primary coating and mineral-based secondary coating. The method uses a static load cell to measure the agglomerated granule count fraction under simulated storage conditions. A 2 4-1 fractional factorial experiment with two replications is employed to evaluate the effect of coating drying temperature, drying time, asphalt to secondary coating mass ratio, and secondary coating type on the agglomerated count fraction at ambient temperature and 60°C. The test is able to measure a statistically significant increase in agglomeration resistance when the coating is applied, with an agglomerated fraction of 17.5% at 60 °C. The test identifies asphalt to secondary coating weight ratio as a significant factor, with an ANOVA p-value much lower than other effects. A decrease in this mass ratio from 5:1 to 5:2 increases the agglomeration, which is hypothesized to be attributed to the hydrated cementitious phase between granular external surfaces. More work is needed to identify the acceptable fraction of agglomerated granules.

AB  - A finite set X⊆Rn with a weight function w: X→R&gt;0 is called Euclidean t-design in Rn(supported by p concentric spheres) if the following condition holds: is a sphere of radius ri ≥ 0, Xi = X ∩ Si, and σi(x) is an O(n)-invariant measure on Si such that |Si| = ri n-1|Sn-1, with |Si| is the surface area of Si and |Sn-1| is a surface area of the unit sphere in Rn. Recently, Bajnok (2006) [1] constructed tight Euclidean t-designs in the plane (n = 2) for arbitrary t and p . In this paper we show that for case t = 6 and p = 2 , tight Euclidean 6-designs constructed by Bajnok is the unique configuration in Rn, for 2 ≤ n ≤ 8.

AB  - Most of existing adaptive control schemes are designed to minimize error between plant state and goal state despite the fact that executing actions that are predicted to result in smaller errors only can mislead to non-goal states. We develop an adaptive control scheme that involves manipulating a controller of a general type to improve its performance as measured by an evaluation function. The developed method is closely related to a theory of Reinforcement Learning (RL) but imposes a practical assumption made for faster learning. We assume that a value function of RL can be approximated by a function of Euclidean distance from a goal state and an action executed at the state. And, we propose to use it for the gradient search as an evaluation function. Simulation results provided through application of the proposed scheme to a pole-balancing problem using a linear state feedback controller and fuzzy controller verify the scheme's efficacy.

AB  - We introduce an integral operator on the class A of analytic functions in the unit disk involving k-th Hadamard product (convolution) corresponding to the differential operator defined recently by Al-Shaqsi and Darus. New classes containing this operator are studied. Characterization and other properties of these classes are studied. Moreover, subordination and superordination results involving this operator are obtained.

AB  - This research demonstrates the feasibility of fabricating nanoscale resist patterns on a silicon (Si) substrate using a scanning probe microscope(SPM). In order to utilize scanning probe nanolithography (SPNL) with the other micro-machining techniques such as dry etching, plating and lift-off process, nanoscale resist patterns should be created on an Si substrate with high accuracy in SPNL. We have, so far, established the negative type of SPNL using the negative-tone electron beam (EB) resist named SAL601. The primary objective of this research is to find out appropriate process conditions for establishing the positive type of SPNL using the positive EB resist "ZEP520A". This paper describes the variations of experimentally created nano-patterns depending on the process conditions, and determines the appropriate process conditions from the variations obtained. In addition, we analyzed the electric field in the EB resist by a finite element method (FEM), for estimating the line width of the nanopattern created by SPNL.

AB  - Mariculture (marine aquaculture) has been intensified and has created essential employment opportunities over the last two-decades in Indonesia, as well as many other countries in the world. This development has negative impact to the environment. Considerable amounts of nutrient waste in dissolved and particulate form were released by intensive fish farming into the environment through feed excess, soluble fish excretion and faeces production. One of the first steps to avoid the dangerous environmental impacts is careful site selection to minimize environmental impacts arising from the farming activities (sustainability) as well as to guarantee adequate conditions from the operational point of view (suitability).The paper focuses on the development of a Decision Support System (DSS) as a tool for the appropriate selection of mariculture site location. The DSS is based on physical, chemical and sediment criteria as well as on data of conflicting coastal use. The GIS analysis results in a map indicating the suitable areas for the improved method of offshore cage mariculture. In this study, emphasis was placed on finfish species; however the methods and results may be employed for other species as well following some modifications. The DSS was applied for the western part of Java Sea, Indonesia. The data were acquired from direct field measurement, numerical modeling and existing information from particular agencies. Numerical modeling was used to obtain spatial and temporal distributions of hydrodynamic parameters (i.e. current velocities and water levels). The Delft3D modeling system (Delft Hydraulics, The Netherlands) was employed for this purpose. The DSS was developed under GIS application of ESRI® ArcGIS TM using weighted overlay method. The results showed the adequacy of the system for supporting governmental authorities in the implementation, environmental controlling, and estimation of overall carrying capacity for environmental sustainable marine fish farming.

AB  - Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) is very attractive synthetic polymer due to its properties, such as a high permeability, the lack of toxicity, and also biodegradability. However, it has limited application because of low melting point (60 oC), high crystallinity, and brittleness. The aim of the experiments is designed to improve the properties of PCL by formation of their polymers with 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propandiol monomers with various chain length as a raw material to prepare poly(urethane-ester). These polymers were synthesized by a ring-opening polymerization of 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propandiol and ε-caprolactone monomers in various composition in the presence of 1-hydroxy-3-chloro-tetraisobuthyldistanoxane as a catalyst. Polymers were characterized by analysis of functional groups (FTIR), microstructure (1H and 13C NMR), viscosity, hydroxyl number, and also melting point of polymers (DSC). Based on the structure analysis indicate that polymerization of 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propandiol and ε-caprolactone monomers produced polymers with various molecular weights, which depend on the ratio of ε-caprolactone/2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propandiol used in polymerization. The reactivity of CL monomer decreases to the active site of polymers with longer chain size. The melting points of polymers increase with the increasing of ε-caprolactone composition used in polymerization, whereas hydroxyl number decreases.

AB  - The behavior of a free-hanging riser of floating offshore structures would be different from a typical at-sea-floor-terminated riser type of oil or gas platforms. For the design purpose, the present study was intended to incorporate some important factors of the riser conditions (i.e. bidirectional vibration, free-end condition, and spanwise variation of response amplitude) for investigating its dynamics characteristics. An experimental investigation on time-dependent motion of a flexible free-hanging circular cantilever subjected to uniform cross-flows has been carried out. The free-end condition cantilever has a 34.4 aspect ratio and a low mass ratio of about 1.24. The cylinder freely oscillates in both inline and transverse to the flow. Reynolds number varied from 10,800 to 37,800. The "jump phenomenon" was found in the inline motion of the cylinder that agrees well with an existing comparable work. At high flow velocities, the 3rd higher harmonic frequencies of the cylinder transverse response became predominant that produce quite different motion characteristics compared to the other existing comparable works with 2-dimensional bottom-end condition. Generally, the results suggested that the flexible free-hanging cantilever generate different vortex wake mode than either, a uniform (a short-rigid flexibly-mounted cylinder) or a linear amplitude variation along the span case (a pivoted cylinder).

AB  - This work studied eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a class of perturbed pairwise comparison matrices (PCMs). This type of matrices arises from Analytical Hierarchical Process with inconsistency comparison. By employing some nice structures of the PCMs, we show that the object dimension of size n≥3 can be reduced into a case of size 3, hence simplify the studies.

AB  - Microstructure and chemical composition changes on the alloyed aluminum surface were investigated using SEM-EDX analysis. A Q-switched Nd:YAg laser was focused to induce breakdown and plasma formation. The high plasma temperature and the shock wave pressure were responsible for speeding up the laser surface alloying process. The rapid heat and cooling process introduced a non-equilibrium condition causing changes in the microstructure as well as the chemical composition of the alloyed aluminum surface. The remelted layer and molten pools were realized after the aluminum received a power density greater than 5 x 108 Wcm-2. The chemical composition change confirms that the convection process had taken place during the alloying process. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - A new class of functions called strongly lower semi-continuous (SLSC) functions is defined and its properties are studied. It is shown that the arbitrary supremum and finite infimum of SLSC functions are again SLSC. Using these functions, an induced fuzzy topological space, called s-induced fuzzy topological space on a topological space (X, T), is introduced. Moreover, some incorrect results on fuzzy topological spaces obtained previously by some authors are identified and modified accordingly. Examples of the newly defined induced space are given and their various properties are investigated. Interrelationships between a fuzzy topological space (X, F) and the s-induced fuzzy topological space generated by the crisp members of F are examined. In this process, different lower semi-continuities and induced fuzzy spaces generated by them have been defined in a general set up and their few properties have been studied. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The behavior of a dynamical system, in Willems's point of view, is the set of all trajectories of the system. Fuhrmann defines a behavior as a linear, shift invariant, and complete subspace of z-1Fm[[Z-1]], the vector space -1 m -1 1 consisting of power series in Z- with coefficients in signal space W = Fm. In this paper we show that the behavior of a finite dimensional, time invariant discrete linear system in Willems's setting is also a behavior according to Fuhrmann's. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In this study, we have conducted a crosshole tomography survey to obtain seismic data from two boreholes on the ITB campus. The first borehole was 39 meters deep while the second was 19 meters deep. The aim of the study was to determine the subsurface velocity and Q-factor for the region between the two boreholes for geotechnical purposes. Sources of seismic waves were produced by an impulse generator and sparker and were recorded by 12 channels of borehole hydrophones. In the tomography inversion, the pseudo-bending ray tracing method was employed to calculate travel times. The initial velocity model was a 1-D model with 1x1 m2 block dimensions. The non-linear inversion problem was solved by delay-time tomography with the LSQR method. Also, a checkerboard resolution test (CRT) was conducted to evaluate the resolution of the tomography inversion. Using the velocity structure results, a LSQR Q-tomography inversion was carried out using spectral curve fitting to obtain the attenuation structure (t* values). The resulting tomogram shows that there are 3 layers, with an unconsolidated layer (down to 8 meters), a consolidated layer (from 8 meters deep to 20 meters), and bedrock (more than 20 meters). From the results, the ground water level is estimated at a depth of 14 meters. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The applicability of parameter varying reduced order controllers to aircraft model is proposed. The generalization of the balanced singular perturbation method of linear time invariant (LTI) system is used to reduce the order of linear parameter varying (LPV) system. Based on the reduced order model the low-order LPV controller is designed by using HH∞ synthesis technique. The performance of the reduced order controller is examined by applying it to lateral-directional control of aircraft model having 20th order. Furthermore, the time responses of the closed loop system with reduced order LPV controllers and reduced order LTI controller is compared. From the simulation results, the 8th order LPV controller can maintain stability and to provide the same level of closed-loop systems performance as the full-order LPV controller. It is different with the reduced-order LTI controller that cannot maintain stability and performance for all allowable parameter trajectories. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - This experiment was aimed at finding out the effects of using nitrifying bacteria and Chlorella sp. and the application of a differing number of 3-dimensional cubical bamboo shelters for enhancing the growth performance of Giant Freshwater Prawns (Macrobrachium rosenbergii de Man) during the nursery phase in an indoor system. During 28 days of culture, treatment II (application of 4 shelters ~40% culture volume occupation) resulted in better prawn growth and culture performance compared to control (no shelter application) (p&lt;0, 05). At the end of the experiment, treatment II showed the highest biomass, specific growth rate, mean body weight and length of prawns with (1.96+0.05) g.cage-1, 8.24% BW.day-1, (2.18+0, 89) g and (6.50+0.91) cm, respectively. However, these results were not significantly different compared to treatment I (application of 2 shelters ~20% culture volume occupation). The survival rate after treatment I and II (treatment I=90%, and treatment II=92%) was significantly higher compared to control (78%). During the experiment the increase of the concentration of ammonium and nitrate was controlled by the addition of nitrifying bacteria and microalgae, which can keep the microbial loop between ammonium reduction by bacteria and nitrate uptake by microalgae in balance. The addition of nitrifying bacteria and microalgae, and the availability of 40% bamboo shelter occupation in the culture can improve prawn culture productivity. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - One of the important requirements for earthquake resistant building related to confinement is the use of seismic hooks in the hoop or confining reinforcement of reinforced-concrete column elements. However, installation of a confining reinforcement with a 135-degree hook is not easy. Therefore, in practice, many construction workers apply a confining reinforcement with a 90- degreehook (non-code compliant). Based on research and records of recent earthquakes in Indonesia, the use of a non-code compliant confining reinforcement for concrete columns produces structures with poor seismic performance. This paper presents a study that introduces an additional element that is expected to improve the effectiveness of concrete columns confined with a non-code compliant confining reinforcement. The additional element, named a pen-binder, is used to keep the non-code compliant confining reinforcement in place. The effectiveness of this element under pure axial concentric loading was investigatedcomprehensively.The specimens tested in this study were 18 concrete columns,with a cross-section of 170 mm x 170 mm and a height of 480 mm. The main test variables were the material type of the pen-binder, the angle of the hook, and the confining reinforcement configuration.The test results indicate that adding pen-binders can effectively improve the strength and ductility of the column specimens confined with a non-code compliant confining reinforcement. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - The use of flare gas as injection gas in miscible gas flooding enhanced oil recovery (MGF-EOR) presents a potential synergy between oil production improvement and greenhouse gases emission mitigation. This work is a preliminary evaluation of the feasibility of miscible flare gas injection based on phase behavior computations of a model oil (43%n-C5H12: 57%n-C16H34) and a model flare gas (91%CH4: 9%C2H6). The computations employed the multiple mixing-cell model with Peng-Robinson and PC-SAFT equations of state, and compared the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) value in the cases of flare gas injection and CO2 injection. For CO2 injection, both equations of state produced MMP values close to the measured value of 10.55 MPa. Flare gas injection MMP values were predicted to be 3.6-4.5 times those of CO2 injection. This very high MMP implies high gas compression costs, and may compromise the integrity of the reservoir. Subsequent studies shall explore the gas-oil miscibility behavior of mixtures of flare gas with intermediate hydrocarbon gases and CO2, in order to identify a suitable approach for rendering flare gas feasible as an injection gas in MGF-EOR. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - Disinfection process was applied as the last step of the water treatment to kill pathogenic bacteria in the water. However, according to several studies, the ozonation disinfection process could form undesired by-products. One of the by-products potentially affecting human life is bromate produced from bromide ionic-containing water. This study was carried out to examine the effect of raw water characteristics and pH on bromate formation. Also, the performance of bromate formation for a period of exposure time was analyzed. Raw waters taken from four different areas around Bandung were exposed to ozone introduced to a reactor with a flow rate of 2 L/min. The pH of the raw waters varied from 4, 7 to 10. The results show that there was no evidence of an initial bromide ion concentration, whereas a change in pH value gives a significantly different outcome. In acidic condition (pH of 4) the bromate formation tends to decrease, whereas when the pH value increases to a pH of 10, the bromate formation increases. Therefore, for drinking water with a neutral pH, when bromide ions are detected in the raw water, the drinking water may be toxic due to the presence of bromate. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - Suppose that a time series model is fitted. It is likely that the fitted model is not the true model. In other words, the model has been misspecified. In this paper, we consider the prediction interval problem in the case of a misspecified first-order autoregressive or AR(1) model. We have calculated the coverage probability of an upper one-step-ahead prediction interval for both properly specified and misspecified models through Monte Carlo simulation. It was found that dealing with prediction interval for misspecified model is complicated: the distribution of a future observation conditional on the last observation and the parameter estimator is not identical to the distribution of this future observation conditional on the last observation alone. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - This paper describes a hardware architectural design of a real-time counter based entropy coder at a register transfer level (RTL) computing model. The architecture is based on a lossless compression algorithm called Rice coding, which is optimal for an entropy range of 1.5 < H < 2.5 bits per sample. The architecture incorporates a word-splitting scheme to extend the entropy coverage into a range of 1.5 < H < 7.5 bits per sample. We have designed a data structure in a form of independent code blocks, allowing more robust compressed bitstream. The design focuses on an RTL computing model and architecture, utilizing 8-bit buffers, adders, registers, loader-shifters, select-logics, down-counters, up-counters, and multiplexers. We have validated the architecture (both the encoder and the decoder) in a coprocessor for 8 bits/sample data on an FPGA Xilinx XC4005, utilizing 61% of F&G-CLBs, 34% H-CLBs, 32% FF-CLBs, and 68% IO resources. On this FPGA implementation, the encoder and decoder can achieve 1.74 Mbits/s and 2.91 Mbits/s throughputs, respectively. The architecture allows pipelining, resulting in potentially maximum encoding throughput of 200 Mbit/s on typical real-time TTL implementations. In addition, it uses a minimum number of register elements. As a result, this architecture can result in low cost, low energy consumption and reduced silicon area realizations. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - A new concept of virtual inductor to reduce the low-frequency dc output current ripple of ac-dc converters is introduced in this paper. Virtual inductor is defined as an additional control algorithm that changes the system behavior into the one that has an additional inductor connected on it. The virtual nature of the inductor makes the inductance can be designed without weight and volume restrictions. How to use the virtual inductor to improve the performance of converter current controller is discussed in this paper. Several simulated and experimental results are included to show the validity of the proposed concept. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - This paper proposes a new control design approach for industrial wastewater treatment where its logic control is verifiable. In this research, a treatment control design in a lab-scale was controlled by a microcontroller circuit. The developed system combined anaerobic digestion, aeration and filtration process. Its logic control algorithm was designed by using Signal Interpreted Petri Net. In the logic verification, six analysis properties were satisfied: conflict free (logical process had no conflict behavior), termination (the process could be terminated from any state), non-contradictory outputs, live (any process state could always be reached from other state), deadlock-free, and reversible (the process could always back to initial condition). In the design evaluation, the average value of transparency metrics was 0.984 close to 1 as the best value. The system performance was evaluated by pollutant removal efficiency. The highest removal efficiencies were obtained when each anaerobic and aeration treatment were performed for three days respectively and followed by filtration. Within this condition, the system obtained average removal efficiency 91.7% of Chemical Oxygen Demand and 95.4% of Total Suspended Solids. In terms of electricity consumption, the system needed only 1,857.6 Watt-hour for a batch treatment process. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - Zinc(II) and nickel(II)-complexes of 5-methoxyisatin 3-[N-(4- chlorophenyl) thiosemicarbazone] (H 2MICP) were synthesized and characterized by infrared, ultraviolet and 1H-NMR spectroscopies as well as elemental analysis. Model of H 2MICP and its zinc(II) and nickel(II)-complexes were optimized with B3LYP method using 6-31G(d,p), 6-311G(d,p), 6-311++G(d,p), 6-311++G(2d,2p) basis sets. The calculated 1H-NMR, UV and IR spectra data were compared with experimental results. In addition to the Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis of H 2MICP and its Zinc(II) and Nickel(II) complexes, Fukui functions of H 2MICP were also reported. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - The earth structure between the Minahasa earthquake, coded as C052198B, and observatory stations in Australia has been investigated through analysis in the time domain of three-component seismograms. The synthetic seismograms are constructed from an earth model, the CMT solution of the earthquake and station locations. The calculation is based on the GEMINI method, and the corner frequency is set at 20 mHz. Using deconvolutions of the station instruments responses, the measured and synthetic seismogram can be compared with the same units. The seismogram comparison indicates discre-pancies between recorded data and synthetic seismograms calculated from the anisotropic PREM model, in the travel times of Rayleigh and Love surface wave, as well as the S and core reflected ScS and ScS 2 body waves. Discrepancies of Love wave travel time and the number of oscillations are explained by changes in the crustal velocity model and by setting the positive gradient of β h in the upper mantle. While for Rayleigh waves and arrival times of body waves, corrections to the zero order coefficients of p are needed at layers in the mantle. The interpretation of the results of the waveform analyses indicates strong anisotropy in the upper mantle. The anisotropy also occurs, to a lesser extent, at layers beneath the upper mantle. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - A linear two-person zero-sum pursuit-evasion differential game is considered. Control functions of players are subject to integral constraints. Terminal set is a closed convex subset of n. The Pursuer tries to bring the state of the system to the terminal set and the Evader prevents bringing of the state to the terminal set where control resource of the Pursuer is greater than that of Evader. We obtain a formula for the optimal pursuit time and construct optimal strategies of the players in explicit form. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - Nimotuzumab is an anti-cancer agent that belongs to the inhibitor group of anti-epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR). This antibody inhibits the EGF protein receptor, which is over-expressed on cancer cells in cancers such as colorectal, brain, pancreas, prostate, non-small cell lung, oesophagus, cervical and breast cancer. In order to obtain a higher efficacy agent for therapy of the above-mentioned cancers, nimotuzumab was labeled with beta particle- and gamma-emitter 177Lu. This report discusses the results of our in vitro and in vivo tests, which included cytotoxicity, clearance, imaging and biodistribution tests. The cytotoxicity test of 177Lu-DOTA-nimotuzumab on A 549 cell lines (lung carcinoma) was found to kill more cancer cells compared to that of unradiolabeled nimotuzumab. The clearance test of 177Lu-DOTA-nimotuzumab on normal rats showed that the residues of radioactivity were excreted mostly via the urine. The biodistribution and image tests showed that post injection of 177Lu-DOTA-nimotuzumab there was still some radioactivity in a number of organs, such as the kidney, liver and bone. Although the state of radioactivity post injection of 177Lu-DOTA-nimotuzumab in the above-mentioned organs was nearly the same as or slightly lower compared to other radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, precautions still have to be observed when this product is going to be tested on cancer patients. © 2012 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - Asteroid 1983 SA, well known as 3552 Don Quixote, is one of Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) which is the most probable candidate for the cometary origin, or otherwise as Jupiter-Family-Comets (JFCs). The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of 3552 Don Quixote to be ejected from the Solar System. This paper presents an orbital evolution of 100 hypothetical asteroids generated by cloning 3552 Don Quixote. Investigation of its orbital evolution is conducted by using the SWIFT subroutine package, where the gravitational perturbations of eight major planets in the Solar System are considered. Over very short time scales (~220 kyr) relative to the Solar System life time (~10 Gyr), the asteroid 3552 Don Quixote gave an example of chaotic motion that can cause asteroid to move outward and may be followed by escaping from the Solar System. Probability of ejection within the 220 kyr time scale is 50%. © 2011 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - (ZrO 2) 0.66(HfO 2) 0.34 dielectric films on p-Si (100) were grown by atomic layer deposition method, for which the conduction band offsets, valence band offsets and band gaps were obtained by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy. The band gap, valence and conduction band offset values for (ZrO 2) 0.66(HfO 2) 0.34 dielectric thin film, grown on Si substrate were about 5.34, 2.35 and 1.87 eV respectively. This band alignment was similar to that of ZrO 2. In addition, the dielectric function ε(κ, ω), index of refraction n and the extinction coefficient k for the (ZrO 2) 0.66(HfO 2) 0.34 thin films were obtained from a quantitative analysis of REELS data by comparison to detailed dielectric response model calculations using the QUEELS-ε (k,ω)-REELS software package. These optical properties are similar with ZrO2 dielectric thin films. © 2011 Published by LPPM ITB.

AB  - Retraction spring is a type of orthodontic apparatus that is used to move a tooth with respect to another by utilizing its spring back effect. It is made of metallic wire formed to individual orthodontic cases. A specific geometry results in a set of force system, consisting of forces and moments, that provides specific movement effect when it is pre-activated to the adjacent teeth. Currently, orthodontists select its geometry depending on their knowledge and experience. It is based on separate and less-than-comprehensive literatures that not all orthodontists have access to. It may result in inaccuracies in treating individual tooth retraction case. Engineering approach to estimating retraction spring structural behavior is proposed through analytical, numerical and empirical methods. Castigliano method is used as the analytical approach, whilst finite element method is used as the numerical approach. The two simulation approaches were compared to the experiments to obtain the best simulation model. The behavior of the simulation models agree well with those of experiments. Hence, the simulation models were used to simulate a large number of geometries to form database of structural behavior of retraction spring that could be used in the geometry selection by orthodontists. © 2011 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - Direct Torque Control (DTC) has gained popularity for development of advanced motor control due to its simplicity and offers fast instantaneous torque and flux controls. However, the conventional DTC which is based on hysteresis controller has major drawbacks, namely high torque ripple and variable inverter switching frequency. This paper presents an improved switching strategy for reducing flux and torque ripples in DTC of PMSM drives; wherein the torque hysteresis controller and the look-up table used in the conventional DTC are replaced with a constant frequency torque controller (CFTC) and an optimized look-up table, respectively. It can be shown that a constant switching frequency is established due to the use of the CFTC while the reduction of torque and flux ripples is achieved mainly because of the selection of optimized voltage vector (i.e. with an optimized look-up table). This paper also will explain the construction of DTC schemes implemented using MATLAB-Simulink blocks. Simulation results were shown that a significant reduction of flux and torque ripples which is about 90% can be achieved through the proposed DTC scheme. © 2011 Published by LPPM ITB & PII.

AB  - Adsorption based on the immobilization of amino acids, i.e. leucine and glycine, on the surface of undoped polypyrrole (Ppy) is investigated. Calculations are done based on density functional theory using Gaussian03 software and applying GGA with 6-31G(d) basis set and exchange-correlation model of PBE (Perdew, Burke, Ernzerhof) level of theory. The energy of the Ppy doped with amino acids are minimized with respect to the orientation and distance of the amino acids to the Ppy. Neutral leucine carboxyl shows greater binding energy as compared to that other leucine configurations. It has adsorption energy of 0.25 eV at optimum distance of 2.2 Å from the surface of Ppy. As for the glycine, the zwitterionic carboxyl exhibits the strongest binding energy among other glycine configurations. It has adsorption energy of 0.76 Ev at optimum distance of 1.7 Å from the surface of Ppy. The adsorption processes for both amino acids should proceed easily because the activation barriers are either absent or very small.

AB  - The paper reports an experiment on classification using fully polarimetric SAR data. Many reports have been presented mentioning test sites in temperate regions utilizing polarimetric SAR data from airborne and/or spaceborne SAR sensors. However, few studies are dedicated to tropical region which highly dynamic land uses are observed. Using the AirSAR Sungai Wain fully polarimetric data, capability to extract features in coastal region has been demonstrated by an unsupervised classification technique fed by the Cloude-Pottier decomposition theorem.

AB  - A new voltage control method for single-phase full-bridge PWM inverters that having an output LC filter is proposed in this paper. The proposed voltage controller has a capability to realize a zero steadystate output voltage error with fast response. The zero steady-state output voltage error is achieved by using a controller that is derived by using the virtual LC resonant circuit. Fast response is obtained by using a virtual resistance that is connected in parallel with the filter capacitor. The validity of the proposed method is verified by experimental results.

AB  - This paper presents an improvement to dq-domain method of calculating electromagnetic transients. The proposed methodology works on dq-domain model for all components of the power system and during all time iterations. This is a new direction distinct from the old one where the network is invariably modeled in phase-domain. By modeling the network in dq-domain there is no more problem of interfacing machine to network as usually met in the existing method as machine is modeled invariably in dq-domain. Besides eliminating the time consuming transformation procedure between dq-domain to phase-domain or visa versa the new method is able now to fully exploit the infinite stability region of the trapezoidal rule of integration. The prediction/correction procedure of the conventional dq-domain method, which is notoriously known limiting the stability region, is no longer required. Comparing simulations using the new method and ATP, one of the conventional dq-domain version, show perfect conformity for small time step. For long time step while ATP is failing, the new method still converges accurately up to Nyquist's interval.

AB  - Analysis and minimization of output current ripple of multiphase carrier-based PWM inverters are presented in this paper. Analytical expression of rms value of output current ripple of multiphase PWM inverters as a function of the reference signal is first derived. Based on this expression, it is shown that a pure sinusoidal signal is the optimum reference signal that results in minimum output current ripple. Different to three-phase PWM inverters, injection of harmonics into the sinusoidal reference signal is neither necessary nor useful. The rms values of output current ripple of 5-, 7-, and 9-phase PWM inverters under various reference signals are compared. Experimental results are included to show the validity of the analysis method.

AB  - Cocoa is one of Indonesian-main plantation commodities. During the cocoa seed drying process, there are two types of waste that are cocoa pod and cocoa sweating. Since the organic compounds contained in cocoa sweating is high enough, it is possible to anaerobically treat this wastewater in order to recover either intermediate or end products. Preliminary study showed that the existence of H2 in the reactor would block acetic acid formation. Therefore, the aim of this current experiment was to decrease hydrogen partial pressure by flushing various nitrogen gas flow rate to shift the intermediate products during the cocoa sweating anaerobic treatment. The experiments were carried on a Circulating Bed Reactor (CBR) which contained organic compounds around 100,000 mg/l COD. Then, the reactor was flushed continuously with nitrogen gas as without flushing, 125 ml/min, 500 ml/min and 750 ml/min. The results show there was a possibility that the introduction of nitrogen gas into the reactor could shift the profile of the intermediate product formation. At lower nitrogen gas flow rate more ethanol was formed than acetate formation, although at higher nitrogen gas flow rate the formation of acetate was still low enough.

AB  - Standard Shewhart process control chart has been widely used, but it is not sensitive in detecting small shift. A number of alternatives have been proposed to improve the capability of control chart. The double sampling (DS) control chart is aimed at improving the capability to detect any small shift out-of control condition by observing the second sample without interruption. The capabilities of DS control chart were measured as the expected sample size (as a measure of inspection cost) or the control chart power (as a measure for customer risk). Optimization of these criteria is used to determine the control limits. In this paper, we optimize both producer and customer risks under a certain expected number of sample sizes as the constraint. Comparing the result to the previous procedure that only optimize customer risk, the proposed optimization procedure gives the same first control limit but smaller second control limits with higher value of control chart power.

AB  - This paper presents a reduced order model problem using reciprocal transformation and balanced truncation followed by low order controller design of infinite dimensional systems. The class of systems considered is that of an exponentially stable state linear systems (A,B,C), where operator A has a bounded inverse, and the operator B and C are of finite-rank and bounded. We can connect the system (A,B,C) with its reciprocal system via the solutions of the Lyapunov equations. The realization of the reciprocal system is reduced by balanced truncation. This result is further translated using reciprocal transformation as the reduced-order model for the systems (A,B,C). Then the low order controller is designed based on the reduced order model. The numerical examples are studied using simulations of Euler-Bernoulli beam to show the closed-loop performance.

AB  - The observed currents in the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean and in the outflow straits of the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) are shown to have significant intraseasonal variations and coherency during January 2004 -November 2006. The wavelet analysis between the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean and the ITF straits demonstrates significant intraseasonal coherency for the observed current at 50m depth. At 150m depth, the intraseasonal coherency only occurs between the observed currents in the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean and in the Lombok and Ombai Straits. On the other hand, at 350m depth the intraseasonal coherency is only found between the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean and the Ombai Strait. This intraseasonal coherency is associated with the wind-forced equatorial Kelvin waves which propagate eastward along the equatorial and coastal wave guides. Near-surface intraseasonal variations are associated with the first baroclinic mode with typical phase speed of 2.91 ± 0.46 m s-1, while the deeper layer intraseasonal variations are associated with the second baroclinic mode with typical phase speed of 1.59 ± 0.18 m s-1. Moreover, the lag correlations between the zonal winds and the observed currents at the ITF straits further demonstrate the source of intraseasonal variations in the ITF.

AB  - Java Island has a unique tectonic features and one of it is the pattern of the volcano distribution along the island. The volcano pattern occurrence might be connected to the deeper process of geodynamic. Hence, thermal structure modeling is employed to find any association between the subducting plate and the tectonic of the overriding plate. Thermal structure of a subducting plate depends on the age of the lithosphere and the dip of the subduction. With the lithospheric age increases from west to east of Java, varies from about 90 my to 120 my old, there are dissimilarities in thermal structure models. The comparison with volcanoes positions shows that differences of thermal structure might have associated to variation in the formation of volcanoes in Java Island.

AB  - The tolerance stacking problem arises in the context of assemblies from interchangeable parts because of the inability to produce or to join parts exactly according to nominal dimensions. Either the relevant part's dimension varies around some nominal values from part to part or the act of assembly that leads to variation. For example, as runner of Francis turbine is joined with turbine shaft via mechanical lock, there is not only variation in the diameter of runner and the concentricity between the runner hole and turbine shaft, but also the variation in concentricity between the outer parts of runner to runner hole. Thus, there is the possibility that the assembly of such interacting parts won't function or won't come together as planned. Research in this area has been conducted and 2 mini hydro Francis turbines (800 kW and 910 kW) have been designed and manufactured for San Sarino and Sawi Dago 2 in Central Sulawesi. Experiences in analyzing the tolerance stacks have been documented. In this paper it will be demonstrated how the requirements of assembling performance are derived to be the designed tolerances of each interacting component, such a way that the assembling would be functioning and come together as planned.

AB  - In this exposition, a technique to recover internal control on a distributed parameter system is reported. The system is described by 1-D Klein- Gordon partial differential equation with a time-varying parameter. We would like to recover the internal control applied to the system if we know some limited information about the output. We use a method called sentinel method to recover the internal control. It involves some construction of a linear functional, and we show that this construction relates closely to the exact controllability problem.

AB  - At normal service temperatures, wearing course asphalt mixtures may have ductile cracking. Aggregate gradation characteristic is important to avoid the premature cracking. The present study discusses a relationship between the characteristic of aggregate gradation and crack resistance of wearing course mixtures. Asphalt mixture specimens were prepared using different types of aggregate gradation. The Bailey method was employed in order to recognize the characteristic of aggregate gradations. Notched semi circular bending test was conducted to obtain the critical J integral (J c). The coarse aggregate (CA) ratio and the fine graded fine aggregate coarse (FG FA c) ratio defined by the Bailey method were introduced to recognize the effect of aggregate gradation type on J c. The result was decreasing the J c value with increasing the CA ratio and FG FA c ratio. Satisfying the current Bailey criterion on the CA ratio for stone mastic asphalt mixtures and setting FG FA c of fine graded HMA mixtures near 0.4 seem useful in order to obtain HMA mixtures with a high J c. The present study also discusses spherical aggregates assembly models as an aid to illustrate development of the aggregates interlocking, which influences to the cracking.

AB  - An assessment of recirculation flow in Jatiluhur reservoir is conducted based on two dimensions turbulent κ-ε model. The numerical model wasdeveloped using finite difference method where hydrodynamic equation was solved by the combination of Mc Cormack and splitting methods. The κ-ε equation is solved using quickest scheme in convection term, central scheme in diffusion term and Euler scheme in reaction term. The simulations were done for maximum incoming flow during the rainy season and the dry season. Model results are compared to field measurement from which it is found that rainy season scenario has shown better agreement. Maximum incoming flow released in the rainy season could generate a boundary layer greater average velocity and more recirculation flow than that in the dry season. Further development is required to get more accurate results for the case with less average velocity.

AB  - The synthesis of hydrogen from hydrocarbons through the steam reforming of methanol on Cu/ZnO/Al 2O 3 catalyst has been investigated. This process is assigned to be one of the promising alternatives for fuel cell hydrogen process source. Hydrogen synthesis from methanol can be carried out by means of methanol steam reforming which is a gas phase catalytic reaction between methanol and water. In this research, the Cu/ZnO/Al 2O 3 catalyst prepared by the dry impregnation was used. The specific surface area of catalyst was 194.69 m 2gram. The methanol steam reforming (SRM) reaction was carried out by means of the injection of gas mixture containing methanol and water with 1:1.2 mol ratio and 20-90 mL/minute feed flow rate to a fixed bed reactor loaded by 1 g of catalyst. The reaction temperature was 200-300 °C, and the reactor pressure was 1 atm. Preceding the reaction, catalyst was reduced in the H 2/N 2 mixture at 160 °C. This study shows that at 300 °C reaction temperature, methanol conversion reached 100% at 28 mL/minute gas flow rate. This conversion decreased significantly with the increase of gas flow rate. Meanwhile, the catalyst prepared for SRM was stable in 36 hours of operation at 260 °C. The catalyst exhibited a good stability although the reaction condition was shifted to a higher gas flow rate.

AB  - In this paper, we analytically study the string structure near the break-up of a slender jet of a viscoelastic liquid surrounded by air. The governing equations are derived from the conservation laws of mass and momentum, and the theological equation of the jet. The theological equation of the jet is assurmed to satisfy an Upper Convected Maxwell (UCM) model. Introducing a stretch variable and then applying a transformation, we obtain a coupled system of nonlinear differential equations. Via these equations, we then show that the UCM jet does not break up in finite time, which physically means that it has sufficient time to exhibit the string structure before it breaks up due to the dominant surface force.

AB  - More general correlations between pressure drop and gas-solid flow variables are developed from the present experimental data. The correlation was modeled for a pneumatic conveying system in a vertical pipe. The transition boundary between dense and dilute regimes is constructed from the pressure drop correlations. The gas-solid particle flow variables are quantified by the gas Reynolds (Nref) and the solid Froude (Frp) numbers. The dense flow regime is indicated by the decrease of the pressure drop with the increase of the gas Reynolds number. In contrary, the dilute regime exhibits the increase of the pressure drop with the gas Reynolds number. The proposed correlations were built at the range of gas Reynolds number f from 360 to 500 and solid Froude number from 0,01 to 0,02.
