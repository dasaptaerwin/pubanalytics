AB  - Performance of chemical deacidification of crude palm oil (CPO) using aqueous NaOH solution in a polysulfone hollow fiber ultrafiltration membrane was investigated. The effects of operating temperature, NaOH concentration and flow rates on percentage of free fatty acids (FFA) removal, oil loss, soap entrainment and overall mass transfer coefficient were evaluated. Overall mass transfer coefficients, soap content in oil and neutral oil loss all increased when the temperature was increased from 60 to 70°C due to an increase of the FFA distribution value. A minimum 0.25 N of NaOH or a NaOH to FFA molar ratio of about 7.62 was required to facilitate the expected extraction efficiency. The increased oil flowrate slightly enhanced the solute transport kinetics, while the aqueous phase flowrate did not significantly influence deacidification efficiency or mass transfer coefficient. About 97% of FFA removal was achieved within 4 hours. The maximum oil loss observed was 11% and the highest soap content in the oil without separation step was 3150 ppm. The values of the overall mass transfer coefficient varied from 2.97×10-7to 7.71×10-7 m/s. These results show the potential of using the non dispersive membrane contacting process for chemical deacidification of CPO as well as other vegetable oils. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Modification of polysulfone ultrafiltration membrane was conducted by blending polysulfone with PEG400 and acetone as additives. The influence of each additive on the resulted membrane morphology and fouling characteristics were investigated. The experimental results showed that the hydrophilicity of the polysulfone membrane was improved by the increase of PEG400 in the polysulfone membrane. The water contact angle of the membrane was decreased from 76.1° to 38.31° when 35 %wt of PEG400 was added into the polysulfone solution, while the water content of the membrane was increased by around 38%. The high concentration of PEG400 in the polysulfone solution led to the formation of longer finger-like cavities in the membrane structure and resulted in a thicker membrane skin layer. The high concentration of PEG400 also contributed to the increase in hydraulic resistance of the membrane due to organic matter fouling. This problem could be minimized by the addition of acetone into the polysulfone solution, which resulted in a lower fouling resistance of organic matter during up to five hours of peat water filtration. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Brine discharge is one of the largest sources of wastewater from industrial processes. Because of the environmental impacts arising from improper treatment of brine discharge and more rigorous regulations of pollution control, industries have started to focus on waste minimization and improving the process of wastewater treatment. Several approaches have been proposed to provide a strategy for brine handling by recovering both brine and water or to remove pollutant components so it complies with environmental regulations when discharged. One of the most promising alternatives to brine disposal is reusing the brine, which results in reduction of pollution, minimizing waste volume and salt recovery. The brine may also contain valuable components that could be recovered for profitable use. Also, water recovery from brine effluent is generally performed to save water. In the case of rejected brine from desalination plants, water recovery from higher brine concentrations has huge potential for salt production. This paper gives an overview of different types of brine effluents, their sources and characteristics. Also discussed are impacts of brine on the environment and management options related to their characteristics. ©2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Mixed matrix anion exchange membranes (AEMs) were synthesized using dry-wet phase inversion. The casting solutions were prepared by dispersing finely ground anion-exchange resin particles in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) solutions of polysulfone (PSf). Subsequently, nanosilica particles were introduced into the membranes. The results show that evaporation time (tev) and solution composition contributed to membrane properties formation. A longer tev produces membranes with reduced void fraction inside the membranes, thus the amount of water adsorbed and membrane conductivity are reduced. Meanwhile, the permselectivity was improved by increasing tev, since a longer tev produces membranes with a narrower channel for ion migration and more effective Donnan exclusion. The incorporation of 0.5%-wt nanosilica particles into the polymer matrix led to conductivity improvement (from 2.27 to 3.41 mS.cm-1). This may be associated with additional pathway formation by hydroxyl groups on the silica surface that entraps water and assists ion migration. However, at further silica loading (1.0 and 1.5%-wt), these properties decreased (to 1.9 and 1.4 mS.cm-1 respectively), which attributed to inaccessibility of ion-exchange functional groups due to membrane compactness. It was found from the results that nanosilica contributes to membrane formation (increases casting solution viscosity then reduces void fraction) and membrane functional group addition (provides hydroxyl groups). © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper presents a numerical simulation study on coreflood scale derived from a laboratory study conducted on light oil and water-wet sandstone samples from fields at Tempino and Kenali Asam, Sumatra, Indonesia. A rigorous laboratory study prompted a specified surfactant type among dozens of screened samples, i.e. AN3NS and AN2NS-M for Kenali Asam and Tempino, respectively. The coreflood scale numerical simulation study was performed using a commercial simulator, on the basis of the results from the laboratory study, at a constant temperature of 68°C, 0.3 cc/min injection rate and under 120 psia confining pressure. To get better recovery, the cores were tested using surfactant and polymer in a blended mode, containing 0.03% w/w polymer diluted in each field brine, which accommodated around 8000 ppm salinity. The most significant variable in the multiphase flow is the relative permeability curve, which is affected by interfacial tension (IFT) during waterflooding and surfactant-polymer (SP) flooding. This study shows that relative permeability will be shifted at ultra-low IFT (10-3 to 10-4 mN/m). This shifting phenomenon is governed by the interpolation parameter set, which implicitly represents the capillary number. Further work in matching the numerical results to the coreflood was conducted by changing the interpolation parameters. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Population growth and economic development in Indonesia have increased the production of municipal solid waste (MSW) in many big cities, causing sanitary problems. The (MSW) disposal problem can be solved by applying an appropriate technology that can reduce the volume of the waste effectively and efficiently. Waste-to-Energy (WTE), or Energy-from-Waste (EFW), is one of the most effective and efficient technologies for reducing the waste volume. Energy recovered from the waste can be used for thermal or electricity generation. This paper deals with a feasibility study of utilizing MSW for generating electricity. A survey and investigation of waste characteristics, including waste composition, chemical and physical composition, and heating value, were carried out for typical Bandung MSW. An average heating value of 1500 kcal/kg can be expected from pre-treated MSW to be used as a fuel for direct combustion in a WTE plant. A typical design for a small-scale WTE plant is shown in this paper and also an energy analysis is provided. Approximately 800 kW of electric power can be generated from 50 tonnes of MSW per day. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In the present work, the performance of an adsorption refrigerator driven by a solar collector was investigated. The adsorbent used in this study was 6.5 kg ordinary granular activated carbon of coconut shell produced in the Sumatera Utara province of Indonesia, 3 liters of methanol as adsorbate and 4.5 litres of water as the medium that was cooled. The experiments were carried out under varying weather conditions during seven cycles with total solar radiation about 2.681-3.918 kWh/m2/cycle. In this study, the values of the coefficient of performance (COP) obtained were about 0.0827-0.1271. The values of specific cooling power (SCP) obtained were in the range of 0.01839-0.01883 kW/kg. The experimental results show that the adsorption refrigerator system can deliver an evaporator temperature of about 2.81-13.61°C. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Solving the unit commitment problem is an important task in power system operation for deciding a balanced power production between various types of generating units under technical constraints and environmental limitations. This paper presents a new intelligent computation method, called the Thunderstorm Algorithm (TA), for searching the optimal solution of the integrated economic and emission dispatch (IEED) problem as the operational assessment for determining unit commitment. A simulation using the IEEE-62 bus system showed that TA has smooth convergence and is applicable for solving the IEED problem. The IEED’s solution is associated with the total fuel consumption and pollutant emission. The proposed TA method seems to be a viable new approach for finding the optimal solution of the IEED problem. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Sodium tantalum oxide doping lanthanum (La-NaTaO<inf>3</inf>) compounds were successfully synthesized by a sol-gel method and calcined at different temperatures. Tantalum chloride (TaCl5) was used as starting material and lanthanum nitrate (La(NO<inf>3</inf>)<inf>3</inf>.6H<inf>2</inf>O) as lanthanum source. X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed that the calcination temperature strongly influenced the crystallinity of the prepared samples. The crystallite sizes of the resultant La-NaTaO<inf>3</inf> were in the range of 27-46 nm. The photo catalytic activities of the samples were examined for hydrogen production from an aqueous methanol solution under UV light irradiation. It was found that the photocatalytic activity of the La-NaTaO<inf>3</inf> depended strongly on the calcination temperature. The range of calcination temperatures were 500, 700, and 900°C. The La-NaTaO<inf>3</inf> sample calcined at 900°C showed the highest photocatalytic activity compared to the samples calcined at the other temperatures. The rate of hydrogen production reached a value of 6.16 mmol h-1 g-1 catalyst. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Microalgae cultivated in mixotrophic conditions have received significant attention as a suitable source of biofuel feedstock, based on their high biomass and lipid productivity. POME is one of the wastewaters generated from palm oil mills, containing important nutrients that could be suitable for mixotrophic microalgae growth. The aim of this research was to identify the growth of Chlorella vulgaris cultured in POME medium under mixotrophic conditions in relation to a variety of organic carbon sources added to the POME mixture. The research was conducted with 3 different carbon sources (D-glucose, crude glycerol and NaHCO3) in 40% POME, monitored over 6 days, under an illumination of 3000 lux, and with pH = 7. The biomass was harvested using an autoflocculation method and dry biomass was extracted using an ultrasound method in order to obtain the lipid content. The results show that C. vulgaris using D-glucose as carbon source gained a lipid productivity of 195 mg/l/d. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Indoor pedestrian navigation suffers from the unavailability of useful GNSS signals for navigation. Often a low-cost non-GNSS inertial sensor is used to navigate indoors. However, using only a low-cost inertial sensor for the system degrades its performance due to the low observability of errors affecting such low-cost sensors. Of particular concern is the heading drift error, caused primarily by the unobservability of z-axis gyro bias errors, which results in a huge positioning error when navigating for more than a few seconds. In this paper, the observability of this error is increased by proposing a method of rotating the inertial sensor on its y-axis. The results from a field trial for the proposed innovative method are presented. The method was performed by rotating the sensor mechanically-mounted on a shoe-on a single axis. The method was shown to increase the observability of z-axis gyro bias errors of a low-cost sensor. This is very significant because no other integrated measurements from other sensors are required to increase error observability. This should potentially be very useful for autonomous low-cost inertial pedestrian navigation systems that require a long period of navigation time. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In this research, we have developed, fabricated, tested, and analyzed an artificial basilar membrane prototype (ABMP), which works using sinusoidal waves of various frequencies. The design of the prototype has a trapezoidal shape with a length of 30 mm and a width of 2 to 4 mm. The research was carried out experimentally and analytically. Experimentally, the ABMP's vibration was measured using a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) and a function generator to generate various frequencies. The analytical approach is discussed based on the Wentzel Kramer Brillouin method (WKB). The results show that resonance frequencies can be reached within the range of human hearing, between 20 Hz to 20 kHz. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper proposes a better engineering design of an assistance kit for manual wheelchair users. The design is aimed to enhance the detection of obstacles in the travelling path of the wheelchair user at low cost. This is facilitated by microcontroller and sensor technologies. The proposed design provides the intended user with obstacle detection, light detection, a light emitting diode (LED) emergency light system, and an emergency alarm system. The microcontroller is the main controller that receives input from the sensors and produces output to the light crystal display (LCD) screen, the LED emergency light system, and the emergency alarm system. An ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the presence of obstacles directly behind the wheelchair. If any obstacle exists behind the wheelchair within a set range, the system will alert the wheelchair user through different alarm sounds. In the case of absence of light, the LED emergency light system is activated and turns on a light source, which is attached to the wheelchair to provide a bright and clear path for the user. The distance between the obstacle and the wheelchair, and the status of the LED emergency light system are displayed on the LCD screen. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Production of biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) from biomassbased lactic acid is widely studied for substituting petro-based plastics or polymers. This study investigated PLA production from commercial lactic acid in a batch reactor by applying a direct melt polycondensation method with two kinds of catalyst, γ-aluminium(III) oxide (γ-Al2O3) or zinc oxide (ZnO), in reduced pressure. The molecular weight of the synthesized PLA was determined by capillary viscometry and its structural properties were analyzed by functional group analysis using FT-IR. The yields of polymer production with respect to the theoretical conversion were 47% for γ-Al2O3and 35% for ZnO. However, the PLA from ZnO had a higher molecular weight (150,600 g/mol) than that from γ-Al2O3 (81,400 g/mol). The IR spectra of the synthesized PLA from both catalysts using polycondensation show the same behavior of absorption peaks at wave numbers from 4,500 cm-1 to 500 cm-1, whereas the PLA produced by two other polymerization methods – polycondensation and ring opening polymerization –showed a significant difference in % transmittance intensity pattern as well as peak area absorption at a wave number of 3,500 cm-1 as –OH vibration peak and at 1,750 cm-1 as –C=O carbonyl vibrational peak. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - A pulsed high voltage was used to remove microorganisms in drinking water. The effects of the pulsed high voltage on pH, conductivity, temperature and oxidation reduction potential (ORP) of the drinking water were investigated. The observed results show that the removal efficiency with respect to fecal coliforms and total coliforms increased with the increase of the pulsed high voltage. The removal efficiency for microorganisms such as fecal coliforms and total coliforms was in the range 25-100% and 44-100%, respectively, after the water was exposed to a pulsed high voltage of 5-10 kV for 60 minutes. An increase of the pulsed high voltage caused a decrease in the conductivity and ORP with operational time. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The laboratory-scale erosion-corrosion testing facility at BATAN’s Center for Radioisotope and Radiopharmaceutical Technology (PTRR) in Serpong was employed to simulate flow-induced corrosion of iron surfaces. Surface loss rates were measured by a nuclear technique called thin layer activation (TLA) analysis. A 10-MeV proton beam generated from a typical CS-30 cyclotron was used to produce56Co radionuclide layers on iron surfaces via a56Fe(p,n)56Co nuclear reaction. The labeled iron specimens were then exposed to circulating seawater simulated in BATAN’s flow-induced corrosion test facility. The experimental results indicated that the TLA technique was able to measure a very low flow-induced erosion rate of 0.91±0.3 μm/hr. There was no significant difference in the measured surface loss rates between the remaining activity method and the concentration method. The iron surface loss in seawater was lower than that of the same material in HCl solution observed in earlier studies. ©2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The ionic liquid [MMIM][DMP] was synthesized from the reactants methyl imidazole [MIM] and trimethylphosphate [TMP] and verified using 1HNMR and FTIR. Coconut coir dust was pretreated with a 1% alkaline solution. Its crystalline structure increased significantly due to the dissolution of lignin and hemicelluloses under alkaline conditions, exposing the cellulose. After NaOH and IL were employed, the XRD showed that peak (002) decreased significantly and peak (101) almost vanished. This significant decrease in crystallinity was related to the alteration of the substrate from the cellulose I structure to the cellulose II structure. The pretreated substrates were hydrolyzed to convert them to reducing sugars by pure cellulase and xylanase, and the reaction was conducted at 60°C, pH 3, for 12 or 48 hours. The yields of sugar hydrolyzed from untreated and NaOH-pretreated substrates were 0.07 and 0.12 g sugar/g lignocellulose, respectively. Pretreatment with IL or the combination of NaOH+IL resulted in yields of reducing sugars of 0.11 and 0.13 g/g, respectively. These findings showed that IL pretreatment of the high-lignin lignocellulose is a new prospect for the economical manufacture of reducing sugars and bioethanol in the coming years. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The present study describes a numerical approach for determining both the motive nozzle and constant-area diameters of an ejector as an expansion device, based on the cooling capacity of a split-type air-conditioner using R290 as refrigerant. Previous studies have shown that replacement of HCFC R22 with HC290 (propane) in the air conditioner can improve the coefficient of performance (COP). The purpose of replacing the capillary tube with an ejector as an expansion device in a split-type air conditioner using HC290 is to further improve the COP. In developing the model, conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy equations were applied to each part of the ejector. The numerical results show that the motive nozzle diameter remains constant (1.03 mm) under varying condenser temperatures, whereas the diameter of the constant-area decreases as the condenser temperature increases. It was also found that improvement of the COP can reach 32.90% at a condenser temperature of 55°C. From the results mentioned above, it can be concluded that the use of an ejector can further improve the COP of a split-type air conditioner using HC290 as working fluid. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The financial implications and the time required for carrying out a comprehensive geotechnical investigation to characterize a site can discourage prospective private residential building developers, especially where a large area of land is to be investigated for construction purposes. Also, most of the geotechnical test procedures utilized during site investigation only provide information on points tested in the subsurface. This research method suggests an approach of investigating the subsurface condition of a site in order to obtain key subsoil geotechnical properties necessary for foundation design for proposed engineering facilities. Seismic wave velocities generated from near surface refraction were combined with percussion drilling and cone penetration tests to obtain a comprehensive geotechnical investigation. From the results of the seismic refraction method, the bulk density of the soil, Young’s modulus, bulk modulus, shear modulus and allowable bearing capacity of a competent layer that can bear structural load at the particular study site were determined. The most competent layer was found within the depth observed by geotechnical methods. In addition, regression equations were developed in order to directly obtain the bulk density of the soil, Young’s modulus, bulk modulus, shear modulus and allowable bearing capacity from the primary wave velocities. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The objective of this research was to study a kinetic model of biodiesel production from waste cooking oil assisted by ultrasound power. The model considered the biodiesel production process as a 2nd order reversible reaction, while its kinetic parameters were estimated using MATLAB, based on data extracted from Hingu, et al. [1]. The data represented experiments under low-frequency ultrasonic wave (20 kHz) and variations of temperature, power, catalyst concentration, and alcohol-oil molar ratio. Statistical analysis showed that the proposed model fits well to the experimental data with a determination coefficient (R2) higher than 0.9. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The requirements of green environmental and public health monitoring have become stricter along with greater world attention for global warming. The most common pollutants in the environment that need tightened control are volatile organic compounds (VOC). Compared to other kinds of sensors, semiconductor sensors have certain advantages, including high sensitivity, fast response, simplicity, high reliability and low cost. In this work, ZnO and Sn-doped ZnO nanostructure materials with high surface nanosheet areas were synthesized using chemical bath deposition. The X-ray diffraction patterns could be indexed according to crystallinity mainly to a hexagonal wurzite ZnO structure. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results showed that in all samples, the thin films after the addition of Sn consisted of many kinds of microstructure patterns on a nanoscale, with various sheet shapes. The sensor performance characterizations showed that VOC levels as low as 3 vol% of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and ethanol could be detected at sensitivities of 83.86% and 85.57%, respectively. The highest sensitivity of all sensors was found at an Sn doping of 1.4 at%. This high sensor sensitivity is a result of the high surface area and Sn doping, which in turn produced a higher absorption of the targeted gas. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The objective of this study was to present a sophisticated method of developing supporting material for flood control implementation in DKI Jakarta. High flow rates in the Ciliwung River flowing through Jakarta regularly causes extensive flooding in the rainy season. The affected area comprises highly densely populated villages. For developing an efficient early warning system in view of decreasing the vulnerability of the locations a flood index map has to be available. This study analyses the development of a flood risk map of the inundation area based on a two-dimensional modeling using FESWMS. The reference event used for the model was the most recent significant flood in 2007. The resulting solution represents flood characteristics such as inundation area, inundation depth and flow velocity. Model verification was performed by confrontation of the results with survey data. The model solution was overlaid with a street map of Jakarta. Finally, alternatives for flood mitigation measures are discussed. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The ship dismantling industry is a cause of contamination of the environment by diesel. The objectives of this study were to isolate and screen diesel degrading bacteria from diesel contaminated areas. Diesel contaminated seawater and soil samples were collected from a ship dismantling facility at Tanjungjati, Madura, Indonesia. Isolation was conducted with an aseptic technique and growing the mixture culture was carried out based on the pour plate method. After 24 h of incubation, thirteen bacteria strains were isolated from diesel contaminated seawater and soil samples from the area of study. The isolated bacteria were identified based on morphological characterization. Mostly gram positive bacteria were found. The isolated bacteria were screened by using nutrient agar medium containing various diesel concentrations (0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% (v/v)). The result of the screening test showed that the bacteria coded EL and CT displayed the best resistance and highest growth in diesel polluted medium. It was shown that both of them potentially have a higher capability of utilizing diesel as carbon and energy source than the others. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - There has been a steady increase in traffic accidents with major injuries in Indonesia over the last 10 years, especially those with a score higher than 3 on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). Frontal, side, and rear collisions, as well as pedestrian impact are modes of accident that contribute to the majority of injuries or fatalities. Based on age classification, the 16-30 age group are the most vulnerable road users in Indonesia. Traffic accidents in Indonesia are dominated by motorcycles, which also contribute the highest portion of fatalities and major injuries (AIS score > 3). Most traffic accidents can be attributed to human, road and environmental, or vehicle factors. Careless driving and unruly behavior of the driver are the main causes of accidents in Indonesia. Statistical data and analyses on traffic accidents in Indonesia can be used to develop a comprehensive strategy and policy to reduce the number of fatalities and severe injuries of road accidents in Indonesia. There is a need to balance the high growth of motor vehicles with adequate infrastructure. Good driver education as well as vehicle safety and crashworthiness regulations are required in order to reduce traffic accident fatalities. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In the present study, frontal crash simulations were conducted to determine the effect of various car speeds against the Head Injury Criterion (HIC), a measure of the likelihood of head injury arising from impact. The frontal impact safety of ITB’s formula SAE race car designed by students was evaluated as a case study. LS-DYNA®, an explicit finite element code for non-linear dynamic analysis was utilized in the analysis. To analyze head injury, a two-step simulation was conducted. In the first step, a full-frontal barrier test was simulated without incorporating a dummy inside the car. The output was the deceleration data of the car, which was used as input in the second step, a sled test simulation. In the sled test, only the cockpit and dummy were modeled. The effect of deceleration to the head of the dummy was then evaluated. The results show that HIC values at an impact speed of 7 m/s (25 km/h) to 11 m/s (40 km/h) were below the safe limit and still in the safe zone. However, the HIC values will exceed the safe limit when the speed of impact is the same as or greater than 12 m/s (43 km/h). © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper presents a macro data analysis of Indonesian road accidents in the form of statistical data. Traffic accidents and their subsequent fatalities bring enormous social and economic consequences. A good understanding of the problem is expected to initiate major action toward the improvement of road and vehicle safety. One important milestone is the collection and analysis of road accident data. The results from this study portray the ‘tangled threads’ problem of traffic in Indonesia. The population number and number of vehicles have increased steadily, as has been accurately predicted by experts. Meanwhile, there is not enough infrastructure growth. Motorcycles are the main contributor to traffic accidents and fatalities due to their popularity as an effective vehicle to jump traffic jams. The ‘tangled threads’ need an extremely creative and comprehensive solution. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Biogas upgrading with carbon dioxide absorption in a column of monoethanolamine (MEA) solution was carried out. The effects of controlled parameters on the CO2 absorption such as gas flow rate, solution concentration, height to diameter ratio of the column were considered. High CH4 concentration could be achieved at low gas flow rate and high MEA concentration. The CH4 concentration could be up from 70-75% to 92-95% by volume for 0.2 M MEA. A set of breakthrough curves was obtained to determine the absorption characteristics, such as the absorption constant (k), the absorption time when the CO2 concentration at the outlet was 50% of the concentration at the inlet (τ), and the absorption period (t*) when the CH4 concentration was over 90%. An empirical equation of the methane enrichment with the related parameters was developed. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Knowledge of the mechanical properties of apple peel, as the outermost tissue of the fruit, is crucial for the designing of apple harvesting machines. In this study, longitudinal and transverse tensile tests were conducted on peels from the shadow side and sunlit side of two apple cultivars (Starkrimson and Fuji) using an electronic universal testing machine, and tear tests and puncture tests were carried out on peels of both sides as well. The stress-strain curves and tear and puncture force-deformation curves of the peels were acquired and the tensile strength, elastic modulus, failure strain tear strength, puncture strength of the peels were measured. Also, scanning electron microscope images were made. The results showed that the maximum values of tensile strength, elastic modulus, fracture strain, tear strength, and puncture strength were 2.56 MPa, 24.00 MPa, 19.92%, 0.391 kN·m-1, and 0.289 N·mm-2, respectively. The tensile strength, elastic modulus, and puncture strength values for the Starkrimson peels were higher than those for the Fuji peels from the same side. Apple peel is an anisotropic heterogeneous material. The bearing capacity of the peel depends on the number and distribution of microcracks on the surface, and the size and shape of the epidermal cells. The organization and connections between the cells determine the strength of the connections between cells. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Water injection has been employed in the Tempino oil field since 1996. The current oil recovery factor is 35% of OOIP. Even though the pressure is still high, the oil production rate has declined rapidly and the water cut is approaching 89%. In order to mobilize the oil from the reservoir more effectively, surfactant flooding is one of the solutions that can reduce residual oil saturation. Interaction between crude oil and compatible surfactant generates microemulsion, as an indication of low interfacial tension. Hence the oil is expected to move out of the pore throat easily. In this research, thirty types of surfactants were evaluated. The hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) was calculated and the interfacial tension (IFT) with the reservoir fluid was measured. HLB criteria were established as an indicator of low IFT, which was then tested for Berea core flooding. The results indicate that an HLB between approximately 2.7 and 3.1 (on Davies' Scale) or greater than 11.5 (on Griffin’s Scale) gives low IFT (~10-3 dynes/cm). This characteristic is possesed by surfactant ethoxy carboxylate with a linear hydrophobic structure. This surfactant produces a high incremental oil recovery according to Berea core flood tests. The AN2NS and AN3 surfactants recovered 90% and 86% of OOIP respectively. ©2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This study investigated the potency of sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) bagasse as raw material for pulp and paper using kraft pulping. The effects of alkali and sulfidity loading on kraft pulp and paper properties were also investigated. The pulping condition of the kraft pulp consisted of three levels of alkali loading (17, 19 and 22%) and sulfidity loading (20, 22 and 24%). The maximum cooking temperature was 170°C for 4 h with a liquid to wood ratio of 10:1. Kraft pulping of this Numbu bagasse produced good pulp indicated by high screen yield and delignification selectivity with a low Kappa number (< 10). The unbleached pulp sheet produced a superior brightness level and a high burst index. The increase of active alkali loading tended to produce a negative effect on the pulp yield, Kappa number and paper sheet properties. Therefore, it is suggested to use a lower active alkaline concentration. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - An electrostatic precipitator (ESP) with negative pulse corona discharge for removal of submicron particles in the exhaust gas of thermal equipment such as boilers, burners or internal combustion engines is presented. A wire-cylinder ESP was designed and constructed for experimental testing at laboratory scale. The collection efficiency of submicron particles in the exhaust gas of a diesel burner under various dust loadings and gas velocities was investigated. The results were compared with those obtained from the conventional DC ESP technique. It was found that the pulse peak voltage supply could be set much higher than the sparking limit of the DC energized unit. Thus, the electric field density could be increased, which resulted in a higher collection efficiency. The higher pulse frequency also increased the collection efficiency, especially for submicron particles. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the inter-relationship between process variables and the size and shape of pectin solution droplets upon detachment from a dripping tip as well as Ca-pectinate beads formed after gelation via image analysis. The sphericity factor (SF) of the droplets was generally smaller than 0.05. There was no specific trend between the SF of the droplets and the pectin concentration or the dripping tip radius. The SF the beads formed from high-concentration pectin solutions and a small dripping tip was smaller than 0.05. The results show that the Reynolds number and Ohnesorge number of the droplets fall within the operating region for forming spherical beads in the shape diagram, with the exception to the lower boundary. The lower boundary of the operating region has to be revised to Oh = 2.3. This is because the critical viscosity for Ca-pectinate bead formation is higher than that of Ca-alginate beads. On the other hand, the radius of the droplets and beads increased as the dripping tip radius increased. The bead radius can easily be predicted by Tate's law equation. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The modern food industry and a variety of food products require tolerant starch as raw material for processing in a broad range of techniques, from preparation to storage and distribution. Dual modification of arrowroot starch using hydroxypropylation and cross-linking was carried out to overcome the lack of native arrowroot starch in food processing application. The modifications applied were: combined propylene oxide (8%, 10%, and 12%); sodium tri meta phosphate/STMP (1%, 2%, and 3%); and sodium tri poly phosphate/STPP (4%, 5%, and 6%). These modifications significantly affected the composition of the amylose and amylopectin and the amount of phosphorus in the granules. Higher amounts of phosphate salt gave a higher phosphorus content, which increased the degree of substitution (DS) and the degree of cross-link. Arrowroot starch that was modified using a concentration of 8-10% propylene oxide and 1-2% STMP: 3-5% STPP produced a starch with < 0.4% phosphorus content. A higher concentration of propylene oxide provided a higher degree of hydroxypropyl. The changed physical properties of the modified granular arrowroot starch were examined through SEM testing, and its changed crystalline patterns through X-ray diffraction measurements. Especially, provision of a high concentration of propylene oxide (12%) combined with 3% STMP: 6% STPP affected the granular morphology and the crystallinity. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper presents a seismic response analysis study of liquefiable sites along the northern parts of the coastal area of Bengkulu Province that underwent liquefaction phenomena during the strong earthquake (8.6 Mw) on 12 September 2007. Several investigation tests, including the standard penetration test (SPT) and the soil shear wave velocity test, were conducted at eight locations. The data were used to simulate the seismic response in order to investigate soil behaviors during the earthquake. In addition, the excess pore water pressure ratio obtained from the analysis was compared with the prediction value calculated from empirical data. The results show that liquefaction can occur at shallow depth layers dominated by loose sand. The results also confirm field evidence collected during the earthquake that was reported in several previous studies. The excess pore water pressure ratio was in good agreement with the predicted value from the empirical approach. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Considering its high content of hemicellulose, oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) lignocellulosic biomass waste from palm oil processing has the potential to be utilized as the raw material for the production of xylitol, a low calorie, low GI, and anti cariogenic alternative sugar with similar sweetness to sucrose. This research explored the possibility of converting EFB to xylitol via green microbial fermentation, in particular the effects of inoculum and initial pH on the fermentation performance. It was observed that the cell concentration in the inoculum and the initial pH affect cell growth and xylitol production. pH 5 was observed to give the best fermentation performance. Further, the fermentation tended to yield more xylitol at higher initial cell concentration. It was also observed that no growth or fermentation inhibitory compounds were found in the EFB hydrolysate obtained from enzymatic hydrolysis of EFB. Thus it can be used directly as substrate for xylitol fermentation. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Liquefaction due to strong earthquakes often occurs in sandy soil under low water table conditions with certain physical properties. The physical properties of sandy soil that give effect to liquefaction resistance include grain size and relative density. This paper presents the physical properties of sand soils related to their resistance to vibration. Vibration tests were conducted by using a shaking table. The acceleration and settlement of the samples were recorded during shaking. The tests were conducted with variation of soil density and mean grain size. The test results showed that average grain size and relative density of sand have a unique effect on liquefaction resistance. It can be concluded that there is a density limit with respect to the mean grain size of the sand particles associated with the liquefaction resistance for a certain acceleration. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In the palm oil industry, open ponding, aerobic and anaerobic digestion, physicochemical treatment and membrane filtration are generally applied as conventional treatments of palm oil mill effluent (POME). In this study, a sand filtration-dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) system was investigated as an alternative process for treating POME. This system can reduce land usage, processing time and costs compared to conventional systems. The removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), and oil-grease in relation to the applied voltage were studied. Furthermore, the pH and temperature profiles were investigated. The obtained results indicate that the removal efficiency of COD, BOD5, and oil-grease increased with an increase of the applied voltage. The electrical energy consumption needed is about 10.56 kWh/L of POME. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Affective recognition has emerged in implicit human-computer interaction. Given the physiological signals in the process of affective recognition, the different positions where the physiological signal sensors are installed on the body, along with the daily habits and moods of human beings, influence the affective physiological signals. The scalar product matrix was calculated in this study, based on metric multidimensional scaling witha dissimilarity matrix. Subsequently, the matrix of individual attribute reconstructs was obtained using the principal component factor. The method proposed in this study eliminates day dependence, reduces the effect of time on the physiological signals of the affective state, and improves the accuracy of sentiment classification. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The majority of electrical machines such as induction motors can be modeled by an equivalent two-phase machine model (d-q model). A three-phase induction motor with one of the stator phases opened (faulty three-phase induction motor) can be also modeled by an equivalent two-phase machine. If a conventional vector control method for balanced three-phase induction motors is used for this faulty machine, significant oscillations in speed and torque will result. In this paper, a novel technique for vector control of faulty three-phase induction motors based on rotor-field oriented control (RFOC) is presented. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using MATLAB software. The results show that it achieves significant improvements in the oscillation reduction of the speed and torque responses. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Palm oil mill effluents (POMEs) can contaminate soil, groundwater, and also the water environment. The increasing production of crude palm oil in Indonesia produces an enormous amount of POME waste. Therefore, a method is needed that can be used to purify POMEs. In this paper, an electrocoagulation (EC) method for purification of wastewater and a design to optimize this method are presented. An optimization experiment was performed by varying voltage and process time. The applied voltages were 6, 9, and 12 V and the process time was varied between 30 and 150 minutes. The measured parameters were: COD, BOD5, pH, TSS, lipids, and NH3-N. The result shows that optimum conditions were achieved at a voltage of 12 V and a process time of 150 minutes with COD at 8000 mg/L, BOD5 at 12000 mg/L, pH at 7.46, TSS at 324 mg/L, lipids at 17.8 mg/L, and NH3-N at 0.65 mg/L. The results are in accordance with environmental quality standards for pure water. This study proves that the proposed EC method is effective in purifying POMEs from pollutants. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Adsorption of Cu(II) ions from aqueous solution onto activated carbon (AC) prepared from Pithecellobium jiringa shell (PJS) waste was investigated by conducting batch mode adsorption experiments. The activation with ultrasound assistance removed almost all functional groups in the PJS-AC, while more cavities and pores on the PJS-AC were formed, which was confirmed by FTIR and SEM analyses. The Cu(II) ion adsorption isotherm fitted best to the Freundlich model with average R2 at 0.941. It was also correlated to the Langmuir isotherm with average R2 at 0.889. This indicates that physical sorption took place more than chemical sorption. The maximum Cu(II) ion adsorption capacity onto the PJS-AC for a dose of 1 g was 104.167 mg/g at 30 °C and pH 4.5, where the Langmuir constant was 0.523 L/mg, the Freundlich adsorption intensity was 0.523, and the Freundlich constant was 5.212 L/mg. Cu(II) adsorption followed the pseudo second-order kinetic (PSOKE) model with average R2 at 0.998, maximum adsorption capacity at 96.154 mg/g, PSOKE adsorption rate constant at 0.200 g/mg.min, temperature at 30 °C and pH at 4.5. The changes in enthalpy, entropy, free energy and activation energy were determined, and the results confirmed that Cu(II) adsorption onto the PJS-AC was exothermic chemical adsorption in part. There was a decrease in the degree of freedom and the adsorption was non-spontaneous. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Thermal efficiency and power output of gas turbines increase with increasing turbine rotor inlet tem[1perature. The rotor inlet temperatures in most gas turbines are far higher than the melting point of the blade material. Hence the turbine blades need to be cooled. In this work, simulations were carried out with the leading edge of gas turbine blade being internally cooled by coolant passages with V-shaped ribs at angles of 30°, 45° or 60° and at three aspect ratios (1:1, 1:2 and 2:3). The trailing edge of the blade was cooled by cylindrical and triangular pin-fin perforations in staggered and inline arrangements. Numerical analyses were carried out for each configuration of the cooling passages. The best cooling passages for leading edge and trailing edge were deduced by comparing the results of these analyses. It was found that using V-shaped ribs and fins induces a swirling flow, which in turn increases the velocity gradient and hence produces an improvement in heat transfer. The results show that under real time flow conditions, the application of V-shaped ribs and pin-fin perforations is a very promising technique for improving blade life. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The development of composite adsorbent coating based acrylic polymer solution (APS) mixed with bentonite (ben) was investigated. The composite adsorbent coating was prepared and coated to a high surface area substrate, cotton cellulosic fiber (CCF). The APS/ben-CCF was used for a single cationic methylene blue (MB) dye adsorption system. Characterization of composition and structure of materials and coating was carried out by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and UV-spectroscopy (UV-VIS). The adsorption properties of the APS/ben-CCF were investigated as a function of solution pH, initial dye concentration and contact time as well as solution temperature of MB dye. The result revealed that the APS/ben-CCF functioned well in solutions of various pH (acidic to alkaline), achieving 100% removal of MB within 2 hours of adsorption for 50 ppm. Kinetic studies showed that APS/ben-CCF is endothermic in nature since the adsorption capacity increased with increasing solution temperature. These results demonstrate that APS/ben-CCF composite adsorbent coating is an advanced adsorbent with advantages such as easy phase separation and capability to remove cationic dyes in a short time period. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This research shows the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with finite volume method (FVM) to study the species diffusion and mixing characteristics in a tubular membrane filled with vertical baffles. This study exhibits how to set up the FVM for CFD simulation and residence time distribution (RTD) analysis and compare the mixing characteristics of two membrane tubes with a different number of baffles using RTD curves. In this study, the effects of the number of baffles on flow patterns, features and behavior of air were identified completely through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. In addition, a two-dimensional simulation was implemented to study the effects of steady and unsteady (transient) flow in the tubular membrane. The residence time distribution (RTD) of a tracer in a co-current flow pattern was investigated. For this, the tracer was injected for 1 second into the membrane tubes on a frozen flow field and the concentration variation of the tracer over time was monitored at the outlet. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Electric vehicles are set to become a most attractive alternative transportation mode due to their high efficiency and low emission. Electric vehicles require an efficient energy storage system, e.g. a supercapacitor. Coconut shells have high lignocellulosic content and are not being fully utilized in Indonesia. The lignocellulose could be converted into activated carbon for use as the electrode on a hybrid supercapacitor. This research focused on studying the effect of the addition of carbon nanotube (CNT) composite to porous graphene-like nanosheets (PGNS) as the electrode on a hybrid supercapacitor. The PGNS and CNT composite were synthesized via simultaneous activation and carbonization. Nickel oxide was used as the counter electrode. The CNT composite had a large surface area of 1374.8 m2g-1, pore volume of 1.1 cm3g, and pore size of 3.2 nm. On the other hand, the PGNS had a surface area of 666.1 m2g-1, pore volume of 0.47 cm3g, and pore size of 2.8 nm. The electrode pair between the NiO and the activated carbon achieved 5.69 F/g and 94.1% cycle durability after 10 charging and discharging cycles. The composite had an energy density of 0.38 W h kg-1. The aim of this research was to provide an alternative formula for producing high-performance supercapacitor materials. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Presently, biomass is mostly utilized as co-fuel in coal combustion in view of energy diversification and emission reduction. However, since the coal content of bio-briquettes is high (up to 80% in this study), gas emissions such as those of SOx still occur. Therefore, the introduction of SO2 adsorbent is common in coal briquette or bio-briquette combustion. A calcium-based material is usually used for this goal. The aim of this study was to observe the effects of desulfurization temperature and Ca/S ratio (Ca = calcium content in adsorbent; S = sulfur content in coal and biomass) on desulfurization efficiency and kinetics. The ratio of coal to biomass (palm kernel shell/PKS) was fixed at 90:10 (wt/wt) and the ratios of Ca to S were varied at 1:1, 1.25:1, 1.5:1, 1.75:1 and 2:1. The mixtures of coal, PKS and adsorbent were briquetted at a molding pressure of 6 ton/cm2 with Jatropha curcas seeds and starch mixture as binding agents. Desulfurization was performed within a temperature range of 300 to 500°C for 720 seconds at an airflow rate of 1.2 L/min. The results showed that the highest desulfurization efficiency (90.6%) was associated with the Ca/S ratio of 2:1 and temperature of 400°C. Moreover, the highest reaction rate constant of desulfurization was 0.280 min-1. ©2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In Malaysia, the car safety level has been elevated through regulations and a consumer-based approach, i.e. the New Car Assessment Program in Southeast Asian Countries (ASEAN NCAP). Nevertheless, the availability of information on consumers’ car purchasing decisions towards safety is still limited in Malaysia. Thus, this study was aimed at evaluating consumers’ purchasing decisions of their present cars and investigating their awareness of ASEAN NCAP. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed among consumers visiting different car showrooms and dealer shops. The findings suggest that safety was considered as one of the top three factors by the respondents when purchasing their present cars. Awareness of ASEAN NCAP has increased as compared to a previous study. This information is essential for policy makers, manufacturers and other stakeholders to assist in setting priorities with regard to the promotion of car safety in the country. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The recovery of lithium from geothermal fluid at Lumpur Sidoarjo, Indonesia was investigated employing an adsorption method with polymer membrane as container. The lithium concentration in geothermal fluid from Lumpur Sidoarjo used in the present study was about 5 mg/l. Lithium manganese oxide (LMO) was selected as a promising adsorbent material due to its non-toxic, topotactical behavior and low cost. In this study, LMO with single Li/Mn mole ratio was prepared, i.e. Li1.6Mn1.6O4. The adsorbent was synthesized by solid state reaction at 500 °C for 5 hrs. A lithium uptake yield from the geothermal fluid of around 6.6 mg/g was obtained. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The Bojongsoang Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) serves to treat domestic wastewater originating from Bandung City, West Java, Indonesia. An abundant amount of nutrients as a result of waste decomposition increases the number of microalgae populations present in the pond of the wastewater treatment plant, thereby causing a population explosion of microalgae, also called algal blooming. In a stabilization pond system, the presence of algal blooming is not desirable because it can decrease wastewater treatment performance. More knowledge about the relationship between the nutrients concentration and algae blooming conditions, such as microalgae diversity, is needed to control and maintain the performance of the wastewater treatment plant. Therefore this study was conducted, in order to reveal the diversity of microalgae in the stabilization pond system and its relationship with the water characteristics of the comprising ponds. The results showed that the water quality in the stabilization pond system of Bojongsoang WWTP supported rapid growth of microalgae, where most rapid microbial growth occurred in the anaerobic pond. The microalgae diversity in the stabilization ponds was very high, with various morphologies, probably affiliated with blue-green algae, green algae, cryptophytes, dinoflagellates and diatoms. This study has successfully produced information on microalgae diversity and abundance profiles in a stabilization pond system. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper describes, discusses and compares three new innovations of reinforcement systems for soft soils: (a) a combination of gridded matrass and piles of bamboo, (b) a combination of matrass and piles of bamboo, and (c) a group of mini piles connected by small H-beams with a compacted top layer to hold the top mini piles. First, illustrations and applications of the three types of reinforcement are described from three full-scale field works. Technical bases for the three types are presented, while technical comparisons are discussed next. Finally, conclusions are developed. The case studies, analysis results, and full-scale fieldwork verifications show that the three reinforcement systems have worked properly. Each system has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of construction duration and cost, capability/effectiveness and material availability, especially in rural areas. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In this research, cooling system optimization using thermal energy storage (TES) in shopping center buildings was investigated. Cooling systems in commercial buildings account for up to 50% of their total energy consumption. This incurs high electricity costs related to the tariffs determined by the Indonesian government with the price during peak hours up to twice higher than during off-peak hours. Considering the problem, shifting the use of electrical load away from peak hours is desirable. This may be achieved by using a cooling system with TES. In a TES system, a chiller produces cold water to provide the required cooling load and saves it to a storage tank. Heat loss in the storage tank has to be considered because greater heat loss requires additional chiller capacity and investment costs. Optimization of the cooling system was done by minimizing the combination of chiller capacity, cooling load and heat loss using simplex linear programming. The results showed that up to 20% electricity cost savings can be achieved for a standalone shopping center building. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In Indonesia, 187 million tons of biomass were produced from 8.11 million ha of oil palm plantation in 2009. This massive amount of biomass mainly consists of oil palm fronds (OPF) and oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB), which are normally categorized as waste. The properties of OPF fibers compared to those of synthetic fibers, such as low density, low cost, less abrasion of equipment, and safer production, makes them an attractive reinforcement for composite materials. In this work, the utilization of oil palm empty fruit bunch ash for OPF fiber-polyester resin composite and the effect of process conditions were studied. Water absorption, tensile and flexural strength were used to characterize the effects of alkaline treatment on modified OPF fibers in polyester resin. The investigation focused on the effect of alkaline treatment time. Treatment temperature and liquid to solid ratio were analyzed using Response Surface Method-Central Composite Design (RSM-CCD). The highest tensile strength (44.87 MPa) was achieved at 12 hours soaking time, at 40°C treatment temperature and 5:1 water to ash ratio. The highest flexural strength (120.50 MPa) was obtained at 1.3 hours soaking time, 4 dissolving ratio and 35°C treatment temperature. The lowest water absorption of composite (3.00%) was achieved at the longest soaking time (14.7 hours), 4 dissolving ratio and 35°C treatment temperature. Variance of soaking time, dissolving ratio and temperature in the alkaline treatment process using extract of oil palm empty fruit bunch ash significantly affected the mechanical and physical properties of the oil palm frond fibers reinforced composite. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Supplier selection becomes very important when used in the context of strategic partnerships because of the long-term orientation of the relationship. This paper describes the application of a decision-making approach for selecting a strategic partner (supplier). The approach starts with defining a set of criteria that fits the company’s condition. In the next steps, a combination of fuzzy-ANP and TOPSIS methods is used to determine the weight for each criterion and rank all the alternatives. The application of the approach in an Indonesian manufacturing company showed that the three factors that got the highest weight were “geographical location”, “current operating performance”, and “reliability”. Geographical location got the highest weight because it affects many other factors such as reaction to changes in demand, after-sales service, and delivery lead-time. Application of the approach helps decision-makers to gain effectiveness and efficiency in the decision-making process because it facilitates them to express their group’s collective preferences while also providing opportunities for members to express their individual preferences. Future research can be directed at combining qualitative and quantitative criteria to develop the best criteria and methods for the selection of the best suppliers based on fuzzy ANP and TOPSIS. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Alkali activated fly ash material (AAFAM) has become the most promising material to substitute materials based on ordinary Portland cement (OPC). However, there is no available nomogram for AAFAM mixtures. In contrast, there are many rational methods available in the literature to make paste, mortar and concrete with OPC based materials, such as Monteiro-Helene’s nomogram, which uses Abram’s law, Lyse’s law and Molinari’s law. This paper presents a study to construct such a nomogram for AAFAM mixtures by first conducting experiments on the paste and mortar phases. The procedure of Monteiro-Helene’s nomogram was adopted in this formulation. The first step in this direction was to find a close relationship between the strength and paste composition of the material that can be used as a substitute for Abram’s law. The second step was to construct the equivalent of Lyse’s and Molinari’s relationships by varying the sand and fly ash contents. The results show that it is possible to make a nomogram for AAFAM mixtures such as the one for OPC based materials. Class F fly ash and its mortar phase were used to construct the nomogram. In addition, the mortar samples that were used to build the nomogram had similar solidification products according to their microscopic characteristics. ©2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This study was aimed to find the possibility of applying Bacillus subtilis integrated into mortar matrix as a self-healing agent to seal cracks. Bacterial spores at concentrations of 104, 105, and 106 cells/ml were directly added into pulverized fly ash as medium to protect bacteria in high alkaline conditions. The results show that the addition of Bacillus subtilis spores into the mortar mixture enhanced the compressive strength, especially at the cell concentration of 105 cells/ml. The bacterial mortar had a small ability to recover the stiffness of the mortar, amounting to 34.85% of its original stiffness. The effectiveness of crack sealant and resistance to water flow were limited to a maximum crack width size of 0.22 mm. Physical observation showed that the bacterial mortar is characterized by calcite precipitation as a product of ureolytic bacteria. The quantity and distribution of calcite precipitate depended on the precipitation weight, gravity direction and the oxygen availability. Meanwhile, chemical analysis using XRD and EDX showed that the bacterial mortar had a better crystallinity. ©2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of particle size on the chemical properties of yam flour in five cultivars, yellow/YY, orange/OY, light purple/LPY, purple/PY, and dark purple/DPY. With a mesh sieve, three flour fractions were separated according to particle size: small (128.6-139.7 µm), medium (228.7-257.9 µm), and large (475.4-596.3 µm). The content of moisture (6.81-11.26 %db) and lipids (4.48-9.85 %db) decreased with the increase of particle size, while proteins (4.48-9.85 %db) and carbohydrates (78.12-83.76 %db) were not influenced by particle size. Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and chlorogenic acid were used as standard to investigate the total phenolic compounds in the yam flour, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to investigate the anthocyanin and carotene contents. It was found that there was no size influence on the content of phenolics (0.27-2.82 %db), anthocyanin (2.25-15.27 mg/100g db) in LPY, PY, DPY or carotene (23.75-132.12 mg/100g db) in YY, OY. The differences in chemical composition were due to differences in particle size and heat treatment, but may also have been caused by the different composition of the milling process. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper presents the development of the core spreading vortex element method, a mesh-free method for simulating 3D viscous flow over bluff bodies. The developed method simulates external flow around complex geometry by tracking local velocities and vorticities of particles introduced within the fluid domain. The viscous effect is modeled using the core spreading method coupled with a splitting spatial adaption scheme and a smoothing interpolation scheme for overlapping issues and population control, respectively. The particle’s velocity is calculated using the Biot-Savart formulation. To accelerate computation, the fast multipole method (FMM) is employed. The solver was validated using a number of benchmark problems for both unbounded and bounded flows at low Reynolds numbers. For unbounded cases, simulation of the collision of two vortex rings was performed. The energy spectrum calculated using the current core spreading diffusion model approached that of the particle strength exchange model. To test the performance of the method in simulating bounded flow problems, simulation of flow around a sphere was carried out. The results were found to be in very good agreement with those reported in the literature. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The swift augmentation in the adoption of smartphones, the gadget that resulted from the convergence of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), potentially transforms people's life in myriad dimensions. One potential change induced by smartphones, is how people restructure their daily agenda and consecutively influence their travel pattern. To understand it, this study theoretically reviews mobile professional work, smartphone adoption, and how people conduct their mobile interaction, planning and execution of daily activities. Mobile professionals, the cohort of professionals that spend more than 20% of their total working time moving around out of their work environment; they are important beneficiaries of smartphones and have been chosen as the target of this study. Empirical results of mobile professionals´ experiences in the Greater Jakarta Area are presented at this juncture. Furthermore, their adjustment of activities as a dynamic response to receiving extensive information via smartphones is also analysed. The results indicate that there is a strong adjustment of daily activities by mobile professionals. Through those changes, the transformation of daily travel patterns related to the activity is also brought about by the use of this high-end ICT contrivance. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Three types of shear stud arrangement, respectively featuring an orthogonal, a radial and a critical perimeter pattern, were evaluated numerically. A numerical investigation was conducted using the finite element software ABAQUS to evaluate their ability to resist punching shear in a flat plate. The finite element analysis here is an application of the nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete structures using three-dimensional solid finite elements. The nonlinear characteristics of concrete were achieved by employing the concrete damaged plasticity model in the finite element program. Transverse shear stress was evaluated using finite element analysis in terms of shear stress distribution for flat plate with and without shear stud reinforcement. The model predicted that shear studs placed along the critical perimeter are more effective compared to orthogonal and radial patterns. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The stability of reactor operation for catalytic oxidation of lean CH<inf>4</inf> has been investigated through modeling and simulation, particularly the influence of switching time and heat extraction on reverse flow reactor (RFR) performance. A mathematical model of the RFR was developed, based on one-dimensional pseudo-homogeneous model for mass and heat balances, incorporating heat loss through the reactor wall. The configuration of the RFR consisted of inert-catalyst-inert, with or without heat extraction that makes it possible to store the energy released by the exothermic reaction of CH<inf>4</inf> oxidation. The objective of this study was to investigate the dynamic behavior of the RFR for lean methane oxidation and to find the optimum condition by exploring a stability analysis of the simple reactor. The optimum criteria were defined in terms of CH<inf>4</inf> conversion, CH<inf>4</inf> slip, and heat accumulation in the RFR. At a switching time of 100 s, the CH<inf>4</inf> conversion reached the maximum value, while the CH<inf>4</inf> slip attained its minimum value. The RFR could operate auto thermally with positive heat accumulation, i.e. 0.02 J/s. The stability of the RFR in terms of heat accumulation was achieved at a switching time of 100 s. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Kelud volcano, a stratovolcano with summit elevation of 1731 m above sea level, is considered to be one of the most dangerous volcanoes in Java, Indonesia. Kelud volcano erupts frequently, with the most recent eruption occurred on November 3, 2007. Therefore, volcano monitoring, especially detecting precursory signals prior to an eruption, is important for hazard mitigation for Kelud volcano. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has been proven to bea powerful tool for investigating earth-surface deformation. Hence, we applied D-InSAR (differential InSAR) in an effort to identify preeruptive deformation of Kelud volcano before November 2007 eruption. SAR images, L band ALOS-PALSAR, were used to construct 3 coherent interferograms between January to May 2007. We used the D-InSAR technique to remove topographic effects from interferometry images. During the interval observation, we detected a continuous inflation with a maximum line-of-sight (LOS) displacement of 11cm. Uplift of Kelud volcano was also observed by the tiltmeter 1-2 months prior to the November 2007 eruption. We interpret this inflation as a manifestation of increased volume of magmatic material in the shallow reservoir and magmatic migration towards the surface, indicating an imminent eruption. This study confirms that InSAR technique is a valuable tool for monitoring volcano towards better hazard mitigations. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The Bandung basin is a large basin in Indonesia surrounded by mountains that are associated with faults. There is the possibility of earthquakes generated by these faults shaking populated areas in the basin. The consequences will be worse because the shaking is amplified by the sediment layer of the basin. We have estimated the amplification of SH-waves generated by the Lembang fault using Haskell's method for multilayer models. The pattern of amplification is a decreasing value with increasing distance from the Lembang fault. This pattern is valid for low-frequency incident waves. For higher-frequency incident waves, the pattern looks more complicated. Fortunately, there are many areas with low amplification values. Hopefully, this result will help the local government in making decisions regarding construction planning in this region. Of course, the final objective is to reduce earthquake risks. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The capillary tube is an important control device used in small vapor compression refrigeration systems such as window air-conditioners, household refrigerators and freezers. This paper develops a non-dimensional correlation based on the test results of the adiabatic capillary tube for the mass flow rate through the tube using a hydrocarbon refrigerant mixture of 89.3% propane and 10.7% butane (HCM). The Taguchi method, a statistical experimental design approach, was employed. This approach explores the economic benefit that lies in studies of this nature, where only a small number of experiments are required and yet valid results are obtained. Considering the effects of the capillary tube geometry and the inlet condition of the tube, dimensionless parameters were chosen. The new correlation was also based on the Buckingham Pi theorem. This correlation predicts 86.67% of the present experimental data within a relative deviation of -10% to +10%. The predictions by this correlation were also compared with results in published literature. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Groundwater is an important economic source of water supply for drinking water and irrigation water for agriculture. Surface nuclear magnetic resonance (SNMR) sounding is a relatively new geophysical method that can be used to determine the presence of culturally and economically important substances, such as subsurface water or hydrocarbon distribution. SNMR sounding allows the determination of water content and pore size distribution directly from the surface. The SNMR method is performed by stimulating an alternating current pulse through an antenna at the surface in order to confirm the existence of water in the subsurface. This paper reports the development of a 3-D forward modeling code for SNMR amplitudes and decay times, after which an improved 2-D and 3-D inversion algorithm is investigated, consisting of schemes for regularizing model parameterization. After briefly reviewing inversion schemes generally used in geophysics, the special properties of SNMR or magnetic resonance sounding (MRS) inversion are evaluated. We present an extension of MRS to magnetic resonance tomography (MRT), i.e. an extension for 2-D and 3-D investigation, and the appropriate inversions. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Generally, slab-column frames show lower stiffness, drift capacity, and ductility as compared to beam-column frames. Under combined gravity and lateral cyclic loading, the lower initial stiffness and stiffness degradation lead to poor structural performance. Therefore, in the current codes, slab-column frames are recommended only for Intermediate Moment Frames with dual systems. The objective of this study is to modify slab-column connection details to enhance seismic performance such that the system can also be used with Special Moment Frames. Four specimens of interior slab-column connection models with the same dimensions and flexural reinforcement were tested under gravity and cyclic lateral loads. One specimen, constructed as control specimen, was designed using standard orthogonal stud rails. The other specimens used newly designed stud rails. The experimental results demonstrated that the modified stud rails significantly improved the specimens' behavior. The experimental results demonstrated that the modified stud rails significantly improve the specimen behavior. The highest ratio of initial stiffness adequacy of specimen with modified stud rail was 131.19% for risk category I/II, while the ratio of the control specimen was 97.94%. The highest relative energy dissipation ratio of specimen with modified stud rail was 33.82%, while the ratio of the control specimen was 25.94%. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Cassava is one of Indonesia's original commodities and contains good nutrition and has high productivity and a relatively low price. Cassava flour has a high potential as a substitute for imported wheat flour that is widely used in noodle production. The main purpose of this research was to develop wet noodles from cassava flour that can compete with wet noodles from wheat flour. The research consisted of experiments with several variations of composition and production method for producing cassava flour-based wet noodles. The best result was then examined for its nutritional value, economical value, and market response, and also a comparison was made between the prepared wet noodles and the standard noodles made from wheat flour. The analysis was based on five characteristics: taste, texture, chewiness, aroma, and appearance. Relations between these characteristics with composition, materials used, and methods applied are discussed. The developed cassava flour-based wet noodle meets physical, nutritional, and economical standards. Raw materials of the noodle were cassava flour and a wheat flour composite with a 5:1 ratio, egg, gluten, soda-ash, water, and vegetable oil, while the process was completed in multiple stages. Market response showed that the cassava flour-based wet noodles were 80% similar to wheat-flour noodles. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper concerns on developing a synthesis method of paste-glue production for gummed tape using a corn-based starch as an alternative feedstock from laboratory-scale to pilot-scale and to near commercial scale. Basically, two methods of synthesis were developed to produce paste-glue in laboratory scale. Based on the two methods, we then scale-up the earlier laboratory scale data to pilot-scale and near commercial-scale for developing a large scale process production of paste-glue. Scaling up production from 1,000 ml reactor to 500 L pilot-scale reactor and 1,500 L near commercial scale reactor, we monitored pathway of temperature increase during reaction as well as adjustment of operating condition conducted for laboratory experimental data in order to produce a good quality of paste-glue. Some scaling up parameters have been found as well as critical parameters for a good product quality such as viscosity and ceiling temperature of the reaction which are very crucial in order to give optimum operating condition. We have selected synthesis method of paste-glue production and found the range of the parameters in order to produce a very good quality of paste-glue in pilot scale and near commercial scale. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This investigation aims to propose an attenuation rate for range normalization of echo amplitudes recorded by an acoustic backscattering instrument working at a frequency of 1.0 MHz. The intention of the use of such an attenuation rate is to obtain equal echo levels when using a device from the same family of products with a different working frequency, i.e. a 0.6 MHz instrument, at an identical site. This work is based on a field experiment with a 1.0 MHz Acoustic Wave and Current (AWAC) profiler and a 0.6 MHz Aquadopp profiler. Both profilers were deployed upward, side-by-side in the Semak Daun reef lagoon, Seribu Islands, Java Sea, Indonesia. It was found that the proposed attenuation rate for the 1.0 MHz instrument was one-order magnitude higher with respect to the one used for the 0.6 MHz instrument, and logarithmically depth dependent. The proposed attenuation rate for the 1.0 MHz AWAC is -7.925log(R) + 8.551, with R is the slant range from the transducers to the measured layer. Accordingly, the overall agreement between the 1.0 MHz AWAC echo amplitude and the one recorded by the 0.6 MHz Aquadopp was improved by 18dB, which is quite significant considering that the average echo amplitude discrepancy recorded by each transducer was 2.4dB. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In this work, carbon composite papers (CCP) were successfully produced by mixing 80 wt% carbon derived from coconut coir and 20 wt% binder (ethylene vinyl acetate and polyethylene glycol). The CCPs were prepared with two different forms of carbon material, i.e. powder (particle size: ± 74 µm) and fiber (length: ± 2 mm, diameter: 100-500 µm). Two types of papers were developed based on their composition. The first type, called CCP-1, was made from carbon in powder form (80 wt%), while the second one, CCP-2, was based on a combination of fiber (70 wt%) and powder (10 wt%). The influence of the carbon form on CCP properties were investigated, including electrical conductivity, porosity, hydrophobicity, microstructure, and its performance as a gas diffusion layer (GDL) in a stack of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system. Based on the results, CCP-1 showed a slightly better fuel cell performance than CCP-2, which was also confirmed by its lower porosity, electrical conductivity, and water contact angle. The effect of carbon composite paper’s properties, including its morphology and performance, are disscused in this paper in detail and compared with a commercially based GDL material (TGP-H-120). © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher,.

AB  - In this paper, the effects of vibration parameters of a banana screen, i.e. frequency, amplitude and vibration direction angle, on the screening efficiency per unit time were studied using the discrete element method (DEM). The simulations were validated according to data collected from an experimental prototype screen. Functional relationships between vibration parameters and screening efficiency per unit time are presented. The results showed that the screening efficiency per unit time first displays an increase and later a decrease when the frequency, amplitude or vibration direction angle increased respectively. Vibration parameter optimization was also investigated, using an orthogonal experiment. Based on the banana screen model, it can be concluded that when the frequency is 22 Hz, the amplitude is 2.2 mm and the vibration direction angle is 39°, the screening efficiency of a banana screen is optimal. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher,.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of the rate of fatigue fracture propagation in members under maximum force on a steel arch bridge and to identify the fatigue life of those members under excessive loads. The method for bridge fatigue prediction used was numerical S-N curve controlled by cumulative damage rule, fracture critical member, and fatigue fracture determination based on SNI 1729-2015, S-N category. The distribution of stress, strain and life cycle was obtained. The result revealed 1 critical built-up weld beam on the steel arch bridge, specifically double welded wide flange beam TB7. Excessive loads from heavy vehicles, namely trailer types 7C1, 7C2 and 7C3, were simulated. Initial fracturing would occur after 53 years and 5 months of service with an initial crack size of 1.717 mm, leading to a propagation cycle of 45 years, which would cause critical fractures of 10.55 mm after 99 years. Thus, the maximum number of vehicles permitted to enter the bridge, assuming a 5% increase per year, was 13,450 per year for trailer type 7C3 at a planned capacity of 6,984,000 vehicles. This paper illustrates how fatigue life prediction can be a useful guide for the sustainability of bridges and provide a theoretical basis for developing optimized fatigue life of steel arch bridges. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher,.

AB  - The development of plastics production from biodegradable resources such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) is important due to the increasing demand for plastics. PHAs occur as intracellular solid materials produced by microorganisms as a result of an excess of carbon source and a limitation of nutrients. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) or PHBV, as one of the PHAs, is a combination of two homopolymers, namely poly-3-hydroxybutyrates (PHB) and poly-3-hydroxyvalerates (PHV). This study aimed to investigate the effect of the phosphorus concentration on the production of PHAs by Haloferax mediterranei. It is possible that phosphorus deficiency may affect the length of the HV chains in the copolymer structure and thus influence the copolymer properties. The experiment was done in triplicate at laboratory scale by culturing H. mediterranei in medium with phosphorus limitation using various phosphorus concentrations. During cultivation, the optical density, phosphorus concentration, pH, and dry cell weight were observed. The PHBV product was collected and analyzed using gas chromatography. The result shows that medium with a phosphorus concentration of 0.5 g/L produced higher PHAs than the other phosphorus concentrations. The accumulated PHA was 0.95 g/L with 15.6% of dry biomass and yield YPHA/S of 0.1 g/g. ©2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper proposes the Novel Differential Evolution (NDE) method for solving the environmental economic hydrothermal system dispatch (EEHTSD) problem with the aim to reduce electricity generation fuel costs and emissions of thermal units. The EEHTSD problem is constrained by limitations on generations, active power balance, and amount of available water. NDE applies two modified techniques. The first one is modified mutation, which is used to balance global and local search. The second one is modified selection, which is used to keep the best solutions. When performing this modified selection, the proposed method completely reduces the impact of crossover by setting it to one. Moreover, the task of tuning this factor can be canceled. Original Differential Evolution (ODE), ODE with the first modification (MMDE), and ODE with the second modification (MSDE), and NDE were tested on two different hydrothermal systems for comparison and evaluation purposes. The performance of NDE was also compared to existing methods. It was indicated that the proposed NDE is a very promising method for solving the EEHTSD problem. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Humans require clean water for industrial, agricultural, domestic and ecological purposes. Due to climate change and population increase, the lack of clean water resources is becoming more and more serious. A system dynamics model of water resources is proposed for alleviating water shortage, changing the imbalance between supply and demand, promoting sustainable patterns of consumption and production, protecting and managing water resources. First, a water supply and demand model combining principles and methods of system dynamics was constructed by analyzing the factors that influence water resources. The model is divided into five subsystems according to the water’s purpose, i.e. a supply amount subsystem, an industrial water subsystem, an agricultural water subsystem, an ecological and domestic water subsystem, and a sewage water subsystem. In the model, the supply and demand index can indicate whether scarcity occurs as well as the degree of scarcity. The province of Shandong, China was picked as object of research. Relevant statistical data were analyzed to predict the supply and demand index in Shandong in 15 years using the model. Water scarcity in Shandong is explained through social and environmental drivers by addressing physical and economic decline. Finally, an intervention plan was formulated to avoid water shortage from occurring in the next 15 years. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to review a regional geothermal system by applying the magnetotelluric method, which is one of the geophysical methods that can be used to map subsurface resistivity structures. This method uses electromagnetic waves of natural resources, namely the interaction of the sun (solar wind) and lightning activity on earth. This study used an inverse modeling method, i.e. the non-linear conjugate gradient method, to estimate the resistivity value as a function of depth at points of sounding, while 2-dimensional modeling was used to describe the distribution of the resistivity values laterally or vertically on a trajectory of measurements. Data were collected from the area of Mt. Argopuro, East Java, where the magnetotelluric method has not been applied before. A geothermal system was found under Mt. Argopuro consisting of altered rock, reservoirs and hot rock with sources of heat associated with high resistivity values (1024 ohm.m). The area has potential for geothermal energy exploration in the future. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In this study, the seismic performance of a 2D portal frame subjected to the recorded seismic ground motions of the Northridge 1994 earthquake was evaluated by the force analogy method (FAM) with different element types. To increase the accuracy of FAM, Timoshenko (TS) elements were employed instead of the classical Euler Bernoulli (EB) elements, to revert the shear deformations that are neglected in EB elements. To perform evaluation, the same material and section properties were considered and the same portal frame was analyzed with different element lengths, from 0.5 to 7.0 m in 0.5 m steps. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Color blindness is a condition where a person cannot distinguish colors that are of similar contrast. This paper reports an attempt to develop a mobile phone application that can run on any Android or Windows smart phone. The developed application/software tool is able to assist color blind people by converting an image with low contrast to an image with high contrast. The objective of the proposed work was to develop a program on the LabVIEW platform to i) acquire the image whose information should be processed, ii) develop an algorithm to display a high-contrast crisp image of the actual dull image, and iii) identify the colors and characters present in the dull image for messaging to the user’s phone. The work was implemented on the LabVIEW platform making use of various image processing tools to identify the color and text from the sign board that otherwise cannot be identified by color blind persons. The implementation was tested with several inputs to validate the performance of the proposed method. It was able to produce accurate results for more than 97.3% of the test inputs. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Evaluation of the fate of nitrate and analysis of shallow soil water in a tobacco plantation area were conducted using integration of soil properties and hydrogeochemical analysis, and geo-electrical resistivity methods, taking measurements four times within a three-month period. The sampling data were taken in two areas: a fertilized and a nonfertilized zone. Chemical fertilizer was introduced to the fertilized zone after the first data acquisition. Hydrogeohemical analysis of the soil water was conducted from the surface to a depth of 1 m at an interval of 25 cm. The results show that the cations in the soil water were quite comparable for each monitoring time. Conversely, relatively larger changes in anion content occurred at the surface until a depth of 1 m. In particular, the nitrate concentration reached its maximum level at about 67 days after fertilization and returned to its initial value approximately 195 days after fertilization. The geo-electrical resistivity profiles exhibited no indication of low resistivity values prior to fertilization near the surface. However, lower resistivity values were found in the fertilized zone at the second and third measurement. The result shows that the adjoining environment dissolved the nitrate concentration in the pore soil within the three-month time period. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The ability of fly ash to adsorp Cu(II) ions from two different coal combustion systems was studied. Optimum removal was found at pH 5, contact time 30 minutes and 60 minutes for Fly Ash 1 and Fly Ash 2, respectively, and dosage 10 g/l. The difference in adsorption capacity between both fly ashes may be due to their carbon fraction and CaO content. The removal of Cu (II) ions was caused by both adsorption and/or precipitation. Precipitation is enhanced by lowering the carbon fraction and increasing the CaO content. The adsorption isotherm showed that the Langmuir model fitted well to the experimental data of both fly ashes. A thermodynamic study was conducted at three different temperatures: 25 °C, 45 °C, and 60 °C. The adsorption processes were spontaneous and endothermic and were more favorable at higher temperature. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - A nationwide Vs30 map for Indonesia was developed based on automated topographic classification from 90-m grid digital elevation data and their correlation with Vs30. Automated topographic classification has been proposed by Iwahashi and Pike (2007) and a procedure to convert topographic class into Vs30 maps has been developed by Imamura and Furuta (2015) based on Vs data from J-SHIS (Japan Seismic Hazard Information System). In order to be suitable for Indonesia, calibration work according to Imamura and Furuta’s procedure should be conducted since the geotechnical conditions in Japan may not be the same as in Indonesia. This paper presents adjustment of the Vs30 correlation by Imamura and Furuta to convert topographic class into Vs30 and construct a Vs30 map of Indonesia. This correlation was calibrated by using Vs data from BMKG (Indonesian Agency for Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysics) as well as standard penetration test logs that were collected by the authors. Utilization of local field measurement data will certainly enhance the reliability of the Vs30 map. The developed nationwide Vs30 map will be very useful for disaster mitigation programs and for preliminary design of earthquake resistant buildings and infrastructure in Indonesia. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Solid phase extraction and separation of thorium (Th), uranium (U) and lanthanides were achieved using a humic acid-modified silica gel (Si-HA). Adsorption capacity, effect of contact time, pH, and adsorbent dose were examined at room temperature. The maximum adsorbent capacities (pH = 3) for Th and U were 28.0 and 31.3 mg g-1, respectively. The isotherm parameters denoted that the adsorption was favorable and optimum conditions were attained within 90 min. The kinetic data conformed well to pseudo-second order and intra-particle diffusion models. The distribution coefficients of U, Th and lanthanides in EDTA, citric acid and nitric acid media signify the possible separation of each element from the others. The salinity did not significantly affect the ability of Si-HA to extract Th and U. The adsorbent stability and reusability were also assessed through four-adsorption-desorption cycles. The simplicity of the proposed separation method along with the stability of the adsorbent and high regeneration efficiency under acidic conditions demonstrated the merit of using Si-HA as a low-cost adsorbent. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - A static gesture recognition algorithm is proposed based on a recursive graph of the upper triangular image texture, motivated by the low accuracy and robustness of existing algorithms. Firstly, the fingertip localization method based on contour curvature is used to obtain the palm region and then the gesture contour model is established. Secondly, a recurrence plot of the gesture contour sequence is built, which is constructed using the central point and the starting point coordinates. Finally, the texture recognition algorithm is applied to calculate the normalized distance between the recurrence plots of the gesture. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher recognition accuracy under varying complex backgrounds and illumination. At the same time, when the gesture is in rotation, translation, or scaling, the algorithm has high robustness with a small amount of computation and high efficiency. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In this study, synthesis of TiO2 nanofiber-nanoparticle composite photocatalyst was carried out and its photocatalytic decolorization performance was investigated. TiO2 nanofibers were developed by electrospinning. The TiO2 nanoparticle films were prepared by dipping the glass substrates into a sol solution made by sol-gel method. The TiO2 nanofiber-nanoparticle composite was immobilized on glass plates and annealed at 500 °C. The effects of pH and catalyst loading were studied during a photocatalytic decolorization experiment using simulated dyeing wastewater containing Reactive Black 5 (RB5). The photocatalytic decolorization performance with 60 min of UV-irradiation time using the TiO2 nanofiber-nanoparticle composite was found to be higher (94.4%) than that of the TiO2 nanofibers (75.5%) and the TiO2 nanoparticle catalyst (74.1%). An alkaline condition and high catalyst loading were found to be preferable to achieve optimum photocatalytic decolorization of Reactive Black 5 (RB5). The TiO2 nanofiber-nanoparticle composite could be recovered after reusing multiple times through re-annealing at a high temperature. TiO2 nanofibers based on a composite catalyst that is strongly immobilized on glass plates enlarges the prospect of the photocatalytic method as a compact, practical and effective advanced treatment process for effluents from textile wastewater. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Leachate in Indonesian landfill sites poses a high risk to the surrounding environment should there be leakage in the accumulating ponds. Anaerobic digestion is an attractive option to clean up leachate, mostly due to the affordability of its operational cost. To enhance the efficiency of leachate digestion, anaerobic microbes were immobilized on the surface of natural zeolite powder. The powder was fluidized in a mesophilic anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR) for more stable biofilm formation. The AFBR scheme was split into two stages, with the first stage dominated by the acidogenic process and the second stage dominated by the methanogenic process. The dominating microbes in each stage were provoked by pH control to maintain the first stage acidic at pH 5-5.5 and the second stage neutral at pH 7-7.5. The first stage was run at five different hydraulic retention times (HRTs), while the second stage was run at three different HRTs to determine the optimum HRT for each stage. For acidogenic AFBR with HRTs of 5 days and 2.5 days, the VFA concentration profile increased for a longer period compared to the other HRTs. The COD removal efficiency at steady state was almost identical for all HRTs. For methanogenic AFBR, all three HRTs showed an identical rate of biogas formation at steady state. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has made Kathmandu Valley one of the fastest growing metropolitan cities in South Asia, resulting in the need of additional facilities and infrastructure. The local energy crisis is one of the issues to be addressed. High dependence on imported fossil fuels and the sluggish development of hydropower for electricity generation despite abundant water resources are the major causes to be blamed for the energy crisis in Nepal. This study investigated possible strategies to be implemented in Kathmandu Valley to deal with the discrepancy between energy demand and supply. Several scenarios have been developed and analyzed, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The Comprehensive Scenario, which borrowed from all other developed scenarios, seems superior to the others. It reduces the energy demand by 32.36%, the GHG emission by 44.12%, and the social cost by 33.79%. This scenario implies that the Kathmandu Valley authority will support the installation of photovoltaic solar panels, the use of electric vehicles and electric cookers, and convert solid waste into energy. However, the EV Scenario (electric vehicles) is the one to be given priority in the implementation for its better performance than the other individual scenarios. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In deviated and horizontal drilling, hole-cleaning issues are a common and complex problem. This study explored the effect of various parameters in drilling operations and how they affect the flow rate required for effective cutting transport. Three models, developed following an empirical approach, were employed: Rudi-Shindu’s model, Hopkins’, and Tobenna’s model. Rudi-Shindu’s model needs iteration in the calculation. Firstly, the three models were compared using a sensitivity analysis of drilling parameters affecting cutting transport. The result shows that the models have similar trends but different values for minimum flow velocity. Analysis was conducted to examine the feasibility of using Rudi-Shindu’s, Hopkins’, and Tobenna’s models. The result showed that Hopkins’ model is limited by cutting size and revolution per minute (RPM). The minimum flow rate from Tobenna’s model is affected only by well inclination, drilling fluid weight and drilling fluid rheological property. Meanwhile, Rudi-Shindu’s model is limited by inclinations above 45°. The study showed that the investigated models are not suitable for horizontal wells because they do not include the effect of lateral section. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Packer tests and slug tests were conducted at 49 points at the Grasberg surface mine, Indonesia to obtain hydraulic conductivity data. The HC-system approach, which relies on rock quality designation, lithology permeability index, depth index, and gouge content designation, was applied. Geotechnical drill holes in 441 locations, consisting of 4,850 points of information, were used to determine the K values using the equation K = 2x10-6x HC0.5571. The K values, which were within the range of 10-8and 10-5m/s, were distributed into five alternative 3D distributions using Ordinary Kriging (OK) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The result of the ANN modeling showed that some of the K values, with log K varying from -10.51 m/s to -3.09 m/s, were outside the range of the observed K values. The OK modeling results of K values, with log K varying from -8.12 m/s to -5.75 m/s, were within the range of the observed K values. The ANN modeled K values were slightly more varied than the OK modeled values. The result of an alternative OK modeling was chosen to represent the existing data population of flow media because it fits well to the geological conditions. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper addresses an integrated production and delivery batch scheduling problem for a make-to-order environment over daily time period, where the holding costs of in-process and completed parts at a supplier location and of completed parts at a manufacturer location are distinguished. All orders of parts with different due dates from the manufacturer arrive at the same time. The parts are produced in production batches and subsequently the completed parts are delivered in delivery batches using a capacitated vehicle in order to be received at the respective due dates. This study was aimed at finding an integrated schedule of production and delivery batches so as to meet the due date at minimum total cost consisting of the corresponding holding cost and delivery cost. The holding cost is a derivation of the so-called actual flow time (AFT), while the delivery cost is assumed to be proportional to the number of deliveries. The problems can be formulated as an integer non-linear programming model, and the global optimal solution can be obtained using optimization software. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to cope with the computational time problem using software. The numerical experiences show that the proposed algorithm yields near global optimal solutions. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In this study a number of seismic behavior factors (overall ductility, response modification, and overstrength) of ordinary moment steel frames with viscoelastic bracing system were evaluated. These factors are not provided for ordinary moment steel frames with viscoelastic bracing system in building seismic codes such as the International Building Code (IBC) or Euro Code (EN). Moreover, similar frames without viscoelastic bracing were assessed and compared as well. A linear history analysis both two types with a different number of stories and span lengths was carried out using different earthquake records, which were selected to include variability in ground motion characteristics. Pushover analysis was then performed after defining the sizes of the elements and assigning material nonlinearity to the discrete hinge where plastic rotation occurs to beams and columns according to FEMA 356. Such analysis allows evaluating the overall ductility and the overstrength of each building of concern by using the yield and ultimate displacements and base shear forces obtained from the pushover curve. The results showed that overall ductility, overstrength, and response modification decreased with an increase of the number of stories for all buildings or when the bay length increased. Adding viscoelastic dampers increased the seismic behavior factors for all buildings significantly. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The aim of this study was to validate/calibrate two tools to be able to reliably measure/predict warpage at ambient temperature, especially for ball grid array (BGA) electronic packages. The tools used in this study were a highprecision microscope and a finite-element model. First, the authors calibrated the microscope by comparing the obtained results with the results obtained with a shadow moire machine (considered as reference) and then the finite-element model was calibrated to the microscope. The numerical study was not restricted to a deterministic approach; a stochastic study was also performed for taking into account parameter uncertainties. The results demonstrated that both tools are reliable alternatives for thermomechanical characterization of BGA packages at room temperature. The results obtained in the finite-element model calibration phase showed the importance of adopting a probabilistic approach, at the same time proving that the elaborated warpage numerical model is a good basis for future advanced analysis such as optimization or numerical design of experiments while having reasonable investment and time-consumption costs. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The characteristics of natural organic matter (NOM) released to water from a soil environment were investigated based on the release potential and the quality indexes of SUVA, fluorescence EEM and molecular weight distribution using eight forest and agricultural soils collected from a representative river catchment (Kani River catchment in Gifu, Japan). The content of organic matter (OM) and its release potential to water differed obviously with type of soil origin, in the following order: vegetable field (VF) &lt; paddy field (PF) &lt; broadleaf forest (BF) &lt; coniferous forest (CF) and VF &lt; PF &lt; CF &lt; BF, respectively. For the released NOM, SUVA under different pH conditions decreased in the following order: neutral condition [3.6-24.0 m-1/(mg/L)] &gt; basic condition [3.5-8.0 m-1/(mg/L)] &gt; acidic condition [2.5-3.0 m-1/(mg/L)]. Humic acids (P1), fulvic acids (P2) and protein-like substances (P3) were the main components of the NOM released under neutral condition. The proportion of P1 and P2 released from the forest soils was lower than that from the agricultural soils. Marked differences in UV-absorbing constituents of NOM between forest and agricultural soils were found in the peak with a molecular weight of about 9800 g/mol identified as PSS (polystyrene sulfonate). © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Reactive powder concrete (RPC) is an alternative to normal concrete (NC) allowing for significantly higher strength of partially pre-stressed concrete structures. In the Indonesian national standard SNI 03-2847-2013 (2013) and the American standard ACI 318-14 (2014), the partial pre-stressed ratio (PPR) is limited to a maximum of 25.0 percent to ensure that pre-stressed concrete structures remain ductile and capable to dissipate seismic energy sufficiently. The objective of this experimental study was to investigate the hysteretic performance of partially pre-stressed-RPC (PP-RPC) for both interior and exterior beam-column joint sub-assemblages. Four specimens with different levels of PPR were tested with a combination of constant axial compression and cyclic lateral loads. The PPR used for the first and the second two specimens were 22.8% and 33.8%, respectively. The strength of the RPC was 101.60 MPa for all specimens. The results showed that increasing the PPR of PP-RPC improves its hysteretic performance. The best performing specimen, with a PPR of 33.8%, had a ductility that was 1.97 times that of the specimen with a PPR of 22.8%. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - On-stage sound field analysis of a traditional performance of the Javanese gamelan at Pendopo ISI Surakarta, Indonesia was conducted by analyzing the effective decay time of a normalized autocorrelation function called tau-e, τe, during a performance of the Gambyong Pare Anom dance. The parameter tau-e is used to describe the richness of the frequency content, tempo, and types of gamelan instruments being played at a certain time and position on stage. The tau-e parameter is important for musicians in order to maintain communication between each other such that they can keep the performance in harmony. In order to determine the acoustic parameters heard by gamelan musicians on stage, sound measurements were conducted at 4 points on stage during a performance. Each position represents a specific group of gamelan instruments, which have different characteristics of loudness and frequency, different functions and different ways the instruments are played. The analysis showed that each of the four positions had a different value of τe, which fluctuated throughout the performance. Overall, the dominant τe at position 1 was 20 ms; at position 2 it was 50 ms; at position 3 it was 20 ms; and at position 4 it was 40 ms. The distribution of τe on the stage shows that positions 1 and 3 had more frequency richness compared to positions 2 and 4. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Lower density materials of TiAl based intermetallic alloys have recently attracted intensive attention for the replacement of nickel-based superalloys used at high temperatures. As aluminium-rich titanium aluminide intermetallic compounds are normally brittle, two-phase α2-Ti3Al/γ-TiAl alloys have been developed. To increase the corrosion resistance of these alloy systems, an aluminide coating of TiAl3 layer is normally applied. During operation at high temperatures, however, interdiffusion between the coating and the alloy substrate can occur and decrease the TiAl3 layer thickness of the coating. The effects of temperature exposure on the growth of the TiAl2 interdiffusion zone layer on two-phase α2-Ti3Al/γ-TiAl alloys with a chemical composition of Ti-47Al-2Nb-2Cr-0.5Y-0.5Zr are presented in this paper. The exponents for kinetics and rate constant of the TiAl2 interdiffusion layer growth of this multi-component system were found under variation of temperature. The results were compared with those from other researchers. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Piled raft foundation designs consider the contribution of the pile cap in transferring load to the ground and distributing load over the piles. The concept of a piled raft foundation requires a comprehensive evaluation of a number of factors that affect the performance of the foundation system. In this research the interaction among piles, pile cap and soil of a piled raft system on medium and stiff clays was studied. The effects of various distances between piles (s/d) in affecting load transfer mechanisms and deformation were considered. The study was performed by utilizing the 3D finite element method with a professional software package called Plaxis3D Foundation. A case study of the piled raft foundation performances of a foundation design for a high-rise building based on the soil stratification in Jakarta was also performed and is presented in this paper. ©2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The number of people using online tablets in public places has increased dramatically. Their postures are dominantly characterized by non-neutral and awkward positions that in the long term may lead to a higher risk of musculoskeletal disorders. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of tablet compared to laptop (i.e. netbook) usage postures on the development of fatigue, discomfort and pain. A total of 12 participants accomplished email typing tasks for 2 hours with four different usage configurations: 1) Netbook-on-table, 2) Netbook-on-lap, 3) Tablet-on-table, and 4) Tablet-on-lap. Changes in fatigue, discomfort, and pain were monitored based on pinch grip strength (tip pinch, key pinch, and palmar pinch), rating of perceived discomfort, and Phalen’s & Reverse Phalen’s tests, respectively. The results indicated that the effect of portable device placement was significant (p < 0.05), with varied effects across measurements. No effect of portable computer type was found. The interactive effect of portable computer type and placement was only significant for right tip pinch (p < 0.05). The findings of this study can hopefully be used to increase the awareness of tablet users about associated fatigue, discomfort and pain while using a tablet in public places that may lead to a higher risk of musculoskeletal disorders. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In the present paper, the effectiveness of the use of blinding agents, ionic exchanger resins and the combination of them in improving gold extraction from simulated preg-robbing ore is discussed. The blinding agents used were kerosene, diesel oil and pine oil, while the ion exchange resins used were Lewatit Monoplus MP 800, Lewatit AF 5 and guanidine. Preg-robbing conditions were simulated by blending fine activated carbon with ore sample. The investigation results show that the presence of artificial carbonaceous materials at 2% (w/w) in the gold ore significantly reduces gold recovery. Pretreatment of artificial preg-robbing ore prior to cyanidation by mixing with kerosene, diesel oil and pine oil for 0.5h improved gold recovery up to 25.4%. A combination of pre-treatment using blinding agent and a resin in leach (RIL) test using Lewatit MP 800 resin demonstrated a synergistic effect that improves gold recovery up to a level of 99.5%,which is significantly higher than using activated carbon and without pretreatment. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The transportation sector is the biggest contributor to air pollution in Indonesia, especially in metropolitan cities. Gases such as oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are produced during the combustion of fossil fuels in the internal combustion of vehicle engines. Oxides of nitrogen such as nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are important air pollutants, because they cause significant harm to human health and play an important role in being precursors of other dangerous pollutants such as photochemical smog. One of the simple ways to reduce NOx concentrations is utilizing a catalytic process involving UV light and semiconductor particles such as TiO2. Illuminated TiO2 UV light is capable of producing an electron (e-) and hole (h-) pair, which initiates a chemical reaction that alters the NOx to become NO3 - or NO2 -. A field scale paving block reactor coated with TiO2 placed by the roadside was exposed to UV light using various exposure times. The results showed that the sample with a composition of 200 g/m2 TiO2 was capable of adsorbing NOx gas at an average rate of 0.0046 mg/m2/minute. Additional costs due to TiO2 coating for every square meter of paving are IDR 13,180. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Wood is a natural resource that is renewable and available in various species in tropical countries. Its abundancy in nature makes it easy to obtain, thus making it a nature friendly material for use in construction. Indonesia is the most important source of tropical wood in the world after Brazil, making the use of wood for structural elements very desirable. It is estimated that 4000 different varieties of wood exist in Indonesia. This estimate is based on the herbarium species collected by the Forestry Research Institute, currently counting nearly 4000 types of trees with a diameter of more than 40 cm. In the Indonesian wood structure code, the strength of woods is divided into 3 grades (grade I, II and III). This paper presents an evaluation of the mechanical properties of glulam wood sourced from native Indonesian timber: Bengkirai wood (grade I), Kamper wood (grade II), and Nyatoh wood (grade III), thus proving the potential for Indonesian wood as industrial structural elements in wooden constructions. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In 2010 a national team (Team 9) developed the hazard curve and maximum considered earthquake (MCE) for the whole Indonesian area. The results were further applied in this study. Risk-targeted ground motions (RTGM) with 1% probability of building collapse in 50 years were developed by integrating the hazard curve with the structural capacity distribution. Parametric study on various variables that affect the log-normal standard deviation suggests a value of 0.7. In the effort to obtain the RTGM for the whole Indonesian region, integration was carried out using definite integration in which the curves are split into thin vertical strips and the areas below each curve are multiplied and summed. Detailed procedures and verification are given in this paper. An example of RTGM calculation was carried out for Jakarta City and then applied to the whole Indonesian region. Risk coefficients defining the ratio between RTGM and MCE were eventually developed and mapped. Risk coefficient development was generated for two periods of interest, i.e. a short time period (T = 0.2 seconds) and a 1-second period, respectively. Based on the results, for the period of 1.0 seconds 55% of Indonesian cities/districts have a risk coefficient in the range of 0.9 to 1.1 and about 37% in the range of 0.7 to 0.9, with only 5% in the range of 1.1 to 1.25. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - An optimization method is proposed to perform high-accuracy terrain reconstruction of the landing area of Chang’e III. First, feature matching is conducted using geometric model constraints. Then, the initial terrain is obtained and the initial normal vector of each point is solved on the basis of the initial terrain. By changing the vector around the initial normal vector in small steps a set of new vectors is obtained. By combining these vectors with the direction of light and camera, the functions are set up on the basis of a surface reflection model. Then, a series of gray values is derived by solving the equations. The new optimized vector is recorded when the obtained gray value is closest to the corresponding pixel. Finally, the optimized terrain is obtained after iteration of the vector field. Experiments were conducted using the laboratory images and descent images of Chang’e III. The results showed that the performance of the proposed method was better than that of the classical feature matching method. It can provide a reference for terrain reconstruction of the landing area in subsequent moon exploration missions. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Silica membranes were developed and tested for the separation of acetic acid and water by pervaporation. Thin microporous silica membranes were prepared on a porous alumina tube by sol-gel method using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as the silica precursor. Colloidal and polymeric silica sols were prepared by hydrolysis of TEOS. The pervaporation experiment results revealed that the silica membranes showed water selectivity towards acetic acid. The permeate flux and the separation factor were strongly influenced by the composition of the silica sols. For a feed concentration of 90 wt% acetic acid, the permeate flux varied between 0.016 to 0.91 kg/m2 h, with the separation factor varying between 3.7 and 324. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - An essential factor adversely affecting the performance of construction projects is the improper handling of materials during site activities. In addition, paper-based reports are mostly used to record and exchange information related to the material components within the supply chain, which is problematic and inefficient. Generally, technologies (such as wireless systems and RFID) are not being adequately used to overcome human errors and are not well integrated with project management systems to make tracking and management of materials easier and faster. Findings from a literature review and surveys showed that there is a lack of positive examples of such tools having been used effectively. Therefore, this research focused on the development of a materials tracking system that integrates RFID-based materials management with resources modelling to improve on-site materials tracking. Rapid prototyping was used to develop the system and testing of the system was carried out to examine the functionality and working appropriately. The proposed system is intended to promote the employment of RFID for automatic materials tracking with integration of resource modelling (Microsoft ® Office Project) in the project management system in order to establish which of the tagged components are required resources for certain project tasks. In conclusion, the system provides an automatic and easy tracking method for managing materials during materials delivery and inventory management processes in construction projects. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Red macroalgae have the potential to be processed into bioethanol due to their high carbohydrate and low lignin content. Gelidium latifolium and Gracilaria verrucosa are red macroalgae commonly found in Indonesian seas. Sometimes an over-supply of red macroalgae is rejected by the food industry, which opens up opportunities for others uses, e.g. for producing bioethanol. The objectives of this research were to analyze the influence of sulfuric acid concentration on hydrolysis of G. latifolium and G. verrucosa and to calculate the optimum fermentation process to produce bioethanol. G. latifolium and G. verrucosa were hydrolyzed using H 2 SO 4 at concentrations of 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4%, at a temperature of 121 °C and a pressure of 1.5 bar for 45 minutes. The process of fermentation was done using Saccharomyces cerevisiae in anaerobic conditions for 4, 5, 6 and 7 days. The results show that the optimum H2SO4 concentrations to hydrolyze G. latifolium and G. verrucosa were 1% and 2% respectively. The number of S. cerevisiae cells in hydrolysate G. latifolium and G. verrucosa increased in the third adaptation. S. cerevisiae can convert sugar from G. latifolium and G. verrucosa into bioethanol through fermentation. The highest bioethanol yields were achieved on days five and six. Therefore, red macroalgae can be seen as a potential raw material for bioethanol production. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The limitations of the gold standard angiography technique in arteriovenous access surveillance have opened a gap for researchers to find the best way to monitor this condition with low-cost, non-invasive and continuous bedside monitoring. The phonoangiography technique has been developed prior to these limits. This measurement and monitoring technique, associated with intelligence signal processing, promises better analysis for early detection of hemodialysis access problems, such as stenosis and thrombosis. Some research groups have shown that the phonoangiography technique could identify as many as 20% of vascular diameter changes and also its frequency characteristics due to hemodialysis access problems. The frequency characteristics of these acoustical signals are presented and discussed in detail to understand the association with the stenosis level, blood flows, sensor locations, fundamental frequency bands of normal and abnormal conditions, and also the spectral energy produced. This promising technique could be used in the near future as a tool for pre-diagnosis of arteriovenous access before any further access correction by surgical techniques is required. This paper provides an extensive review of various arteriovenous access monitoring techniques based on non-imaging acoustical properties. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Kaolin is one of several types of clay minerals. The most common crystalline phase constituting kaolin minerals is kaolinite, with the chemical composition Al2Si2O5(OH)4. Kaolin is mostly used for manufacturing traditional ceramics and also to synthesize zeolites or molecular sieves. The Si-O and Al-O structures in kaolin are inactive and inert, so activation by calcination is required. This work studies the conversion of kaolin originating from Bangka island in Indonesia into calcined kaolin phase as precursor in NaY zeolite synthesis. In the calcination process, the kaolinite undergoes phase transformations from metakaolin to mullite. The Bangka kaolin is 74.3% crystalline, predominantly composed of kaolinite, and 25.7% amorphous, with an SiO2/Al2O3 mass ratio of 1.64. Thermal characterization using simultaneous DSC/TGA identified an endothermic peak at 527 °C and an exothermic peak at 1013 °C. Thus, three calcination temperatures (700, 1013, and 1050 °C) were selected to produce calcined kaolins with different phase distributions. The best product, with 87.8% NaY zeolite in the 54.7% crystalline product and an SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio of 5.35, was obtained through hydrothermal synthesis using mixed calcined kaolins with a composition of K700C: K1013C: K1050C = 10: 85: 5 in %-mass, with seed addition, at a temperature of 93 °C and a reaction time of 15 hours. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In this research a measurement systemwas developedfor monitoring humidity and temperature in the cavity between the wall and the insulating material in the building envelope. This new technology does not disturb the insulating material during testing. The measurement system can also be applied to insulation fixed ten or twenty years earlier and sufficiently reveals the quality of the insulation. A mathematical model is proposed to characterize the dynamic responses in the cavity between the wall and the building insulation as influenced by weather conditions.These dynamic responses are manifested as a delay of both humidity and temperature changes in the cavity when compared with the changes in the ambient surrounding of the building. The process is then modeled through numerical methods and statistical analysis of the experimental data obtained using the new system of measurement. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper concerns the production of methyl laurate from coconut cream through fractionation of methyl esters. Coconut oil was produced by wet processing of coconut cream. The esters were prepared by reacting coconut oil and methanol using homogeneous catalyst KOH in a batch reactor, followed by fractionation of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) at various reduced pressures applying differential batch vacuum distillation. Experimental data were compared with simulation of a batch distillation employing the simple Raoult’s model and modified Raoult’s model of phase equilibria. Activity coefficients (γi) were determined by optimization to refine the models. The modified Rault’s model with activity coefficients gave better agreement with the experimental data, giving the value of γi between 0,56-0,73. For a given boiling temperature, lower operating pressure produced higher purity of C10 and C12 FAME for respective distillates. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Double promoted catalyst (CaO/KI/γ-Al2O3) was used as the catalyst for transesterification of palm oil into biodiesel. The experiment was carried out in a batch reactor consisting of a three-neck glass flask (500 ml capacity) equipped with a reflux condenser, thermometer and magnetic stirrer. Kinetic study was carried out with methanol under reflux conditions at different temperatures (35-75°C) and different times of reaction (1-7 hours). The effects of temperature and time of the reaction on the conversion of palm oil into biodiesel and reaction rate constants were investigated. The results showed that the conversion and rate constants of reaction increased with the increasing of the reaction temperature. The highest conversion of 97% was obtained at 65°C and 5 hours of reaction time. Meanwhile, the activation energy and the frequency factor were 15.47 kJ/mol and 1.22.102, respectively. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In the process of GNSS deformation monitoring, it is inevitable that the monitoring data are contaminated by noise. Effectively mitigating the impact of noise on the measurements and thus improving the quality of the deformation data is the objective of GNSS data processing. Wavelet analysis can analyse the signal according to different frequencies of the signal. Simulation data can be used to determine the best wavelet basis function and select the appropriate decomposition level. In this paper, an improved threshold de-noising method is proposed, based on an analysis of conventional hard threshold de-noising, soft threshold de-noising and compulsory de-noising methods. The improved method was examined through a simulation analysis and applied in an engineering case. The results show that it effectively removed the noise at high frequencies while retaining data details and mutation. The de-noising ability of the proposed technique was better than that of the conventional methods. Moreover, this method significantly improved the quality of the deformation data. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Corrosion in production tubing strings is seen as a challenging problem in gas wells containing carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. This paper presents a new comprehensive method of corrosion rate calculation with integrated study of reservoir condition, nodal analysis of the well, and well trajectory, which could also have an effect due to the possibility of different flow regimes of the production fluid. This method is applicable to evaluate and predict the performance of selected tubing size and material. This method can also give an economic evaluation for the consideration of using corrosion resistant alloy (CRA) or low-alloy steel and carbon steel. The measurement of corrosion rate can be done by several methods, such as using corrosion coupons, calculating the iron content inside the production fluid, or probes. Either way, when the corrosion rate measured in the field is still below the acceptable maximum corrosion rate, it can be said that the adequacy of this method is guaranteed. This method has been implemented in a gas field, where it successfully selected the best tubing material for the next development well in this field. Consequently, the lifetime of the tubing strings could be extended, resulting in an economical benefit as well. ©2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - An analytical model to describe the dynamics of in-flight droplets is presented in this paper to augment information on wind influence on travel distance of in-flight sprinkler droplets. The model is ballistic-theory based. It employs a relatively simple, wide-range empirical relationship between drag coefficient and Reynolds' number to replace the several sets of relations for a specified range of Reynolds numbers. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta numerical integration techniques were used to solve the trajectory equations. A modified exponential model for droplet size distribution was used during the simulation. Comparative analysis showed that agreement exists between the predictions of this model and that of earlier models. Droplets with a diameter smaller than 0.1 mm travelled farthest. Within the droplet range of 0.5 mm to 4.5 mm, as droplet diameter increased, travelled distance increased with increasing wind speed. The extent of drift increased sharply within the droplet range of 0.5 mm to 0.05 mm and increased mildly for droplet diameters greater than 0.5 mm. The model also attempts to identify droplets that are likely to contribute to drift loss and those that have a high probability of contributing only to distortion of the distribution pattern. ©2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher,

AB  - It is very important for mine production safety to ensure the stability of the tailings dam. Taking a flatland tailings pond as the background, a threedimensional computational model was built based on a tailings dam under mullock heap preloading condition. Considering the current operating water level conditions, a liquid-solid coupling analysis of the model was conducted. The deformation characteristics of the tailings dam were revealed during successive preloading at the front of the dam. The safety factor and the potential slide face of the tailings dam were calculated under different conditions using the strength reduction method. The results show that the tailings dam in its current condition is basically stable, but if the mullock heap continues to be heightened, the tailings dam will become unstable. Therefore, in order to limit the height of the mullock heap, establishing a monitor and early warning mechanism are put forward to ensure mine production safety. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop a device for measuring the vertical distribution of the reflected radiation to the inside of a room from terrace to building. The proposed device is attached to aluminum plates that are painted matte black at intervals of 20 cm on polystyrene insulation. The surface temperature of the aluminum plate, called the SAT (sol-air temperature), is used as an indicator of the quantity of solar radiation. In order to compare terrace materials, two of the measuring devices were located facing south. Concrete tile, artificial turf, and wood chips were selected as materials to be compared for the surface of the terrace and were laid in front of the measuring devices. The results indicate that the SAT reflected onto a vertical plane was higher closer to the ground for all materials. Hourly fluctuations of the vertical distribution of the reflected solar radiation differed, depending on the terrace surface material. When concrete tiles of different thicknesses were compared, the temporal heating patterns varied due to differences in heat capacity. These results lead us to the conclusion that using the developed measuring device enables grasping the effect of vertical distribution of reflected solar radiation from a terrace. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - A large amount of wastewater is discharged from potato starch factories in Hokkaido, Japan. The wastewater contains residual potato constituents such as protein, which are named potato fruit juice (PFJ). A powerful stench is generated from PFJ by anaerobic fermentation. In this study, the isoelectric precipitation technique was applied to recover the potato protein from PFJ. Protein recovery from PFJ by acid isoelectric precipitation at pH 3.0 or less reached 80%. PFJ post-protein recovery at pH 3.0 does not produce a powerful stench. Potato protein recovered from PFJ by acid treatment is a useful feed resource. The PFJ in potato starch factory is a potentially promising resource for the production of potato protein. Wastewater from potato starch factories does not have to be waste or a source of powerful stench, it can be a valuable resource. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The subject of the investigation reported in this paper is the visualization of three-dimensional (3D) surface models in a 3D mapping survey using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). The Cangkuang Temple nearby Garut City was chosen as the object. The laser technology instruments used were a Topcon GLS-1000 (Geodetic Laser Scanner) and a Topcon IS (Image Station). Twelve points at the same position in each 3D surface model were selected. The coordinate system of the IS was then transformed into the coordinate system of the GLS-1000 using a 3D similarity transformation model. The 3D distances were calculated for each model. Differences in distance were considered as errors in the x, y, and z direction. The standard deviation of the distance differences was ±0.301 m. Some of the distance differences did not fall within the range of tolerances (about 15%). The 3D surface model visualization of the Cangkuang Temple that was created from the GLS-1000 data was more precise than the one created from the IS data. In the future, such 3D surface model visualizations could be used for documentation, preservation and reconstruction of heritage buildings. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Indonesian construction consulting services are facing a complex problem in fulfilling the nation’s expectations regarding high quality infrastructure development and the construction industry’s competitiveness. A study of this problem and a formulation of solutions to improve the situation are presented in this paper. A survey was carried out in Jakarta, West Java, East Java, and North Sumatra provinces to collect data related to this problem. A focus group discussion and a workshop with all stakeholders were conducted to formulate improvement actions that need to be taken. It was revealed that the problems faced include, among others, the limited number of professional engineers compared to the number of national consultancy companies, the uneven distribution of engineers in Indonesian regions, an imperfect procurement system, and low-quality work output in general. Recommended actions include improvement of the government’s role in consulting services nurturing and facilitation, development of partnerships, and amelioration of the professional engineer and consultant certification system. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The presence of phosphate in wastewaters can cause eutrophication of surface water bodies leading to algal-blooming in the aquatic environment and degradation of water quality. Phosphate removal from wastewaters by conventional biological treatment removes only 10-30% of the phosphate, whilst chemical treatment using precipitants such as calcium or iron salts, although effective, is expensive and produces water-rich sludge which must be further treated. Hence, phosphate removal by adsorption in the form of Ca-phosphate has been proposed as an alternative to the more traditional methods. This study investigated the feasibility of using dolomite–a common sedimentary rock–from Padalarang, West Java, Indonesia as the adsorbent for the removal of phosphate from synthetic aqueous solution. Chemical analysis revealed that the Padalarang dolomite contains 33.6-36.2% CaO. Batch experiments at room temperature indicated that optimum removal of phosphate was achieved at pH 9. At 25°C, where increasing concentrations of phosphate (10–100 mg/L) increased phosphate adsorption (2.15-31.3 mg/g) by the dolomite. The adsorption of phosphate could be described by the Langmuir isotherm model, with constants Q<inf>m</inf>= 476.19 mg/g, K<inf>L</inf>= 0,00106 L/mg and equilibrium parameter (R<inf>L</inf>): 0.904 – 0.989. Phosphate adsorption by dolomite not only permits its removal but also its potential recovery for reuse. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper proposes a method for skin region segmentation for face images with unbalanced color and light based on preprocessing of a multicolor face image sequence. In this method, multicolor face images from a sequence are preprocessed in order to remove color offset and uneven brightness. Then the color data from the preprocessed face images are used for taking the average in order to remove noise and smoothen the face image. Finally, skin region segmentation for the average preprocessed face image is realized based on the established ellipse skin model. Experiments have shown that this method has good performance. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Five samples from a 56 m long drill core that was recovered from the lacustrine Sangkarewang oil shale have been studied by means of petrography and organic geochemistry in order to investigate the organic matter composition and depositional environment of the shale. The organic matter consisted of abundant lamalginite (30%, v/v) and a very limited amount of vitrinite, suggesting an aquatic depositional environment with minor terrestrial influence. Organic geochemical analysis exhibited the dominance of pristane, phytane, and generally n-alkane compounds. These compounds may have originated mostly from aquatic photosynthetic organisms. The oil shale was likely deposited in an anoxic lake environment as suggested by the presence of framboidal pyrite (6%, v/v) and preserved organic matter with a total organic carbon (TOC) percentage of about 4.9%. The pristane/phytane ratio was relatively high (about 3.9) and thought to be source sensitive rather than redox sensitive. Hopanoid and aryl isoprenoid compounds were present in minor amounts. The latter compounds are interpreted to be derived from green sulfur bacteria dwelling in an anoxic environment with the presence of H<inf>2</inf>S in bottom water. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Cassava starch was used as the main chain in the copolymerization of a superabsorbent polymer composite (SAPC) based on acrylic acid and bentonite. The SAPC was synthesized through graft polymerization using nano-sized bentonite as reinforcement. The variables in this experiment were: bentonite concentration, acrylic acid to starch weight ratio, concentration of initiator, and cross linker. The product was characterized using FTIR, SEM and TGA-DSC. The results show that the polymerization reactions involved processes of incorporating starch chains as polymer backbone and grafting acrylic acid monomers onto it. The use of cassava starch in the polymerisation produced a very short reaction time (10-15 minutes), which led to SAPC production with higher efficiency and lower cost. Bentonite interacts with monomers via hydrogen and weak bonding, thus improving the thermal properties of the product. The maximum absorbance capacity obtained was at an acrylic acid to starch weight ratio of 5 and a concentration of initiator, cross linker and bentonite of 0.5, 0.05 and 2 weight percent, respectively. The product is suitable for agricultural and medical applications as well as common superabsorbent polymer applications. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper proposes the control design ofa nonlinear polynomial fuzzy system with H∞ performance objective using a sum of squares (SOS) approach. Fuzzy model and controller are represented by a polynomial fuzzy model and controller. The design condition is obtained by using polynomial Lyapunov functions that not only guarantee stability but also satisfy the H∞ performance objective. The design condition is represented in terms of an SOS that can be numerically solved via the SOSTOOLS. A simulation study is presented to show the effectiveness of the SOS-based H∞ control designfor nonlinear polynomial fuzzy systems. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - As an advanced application of soft computation in the oil and gas industry, genetic algorithms (GA) can contribute to geophysical inversion problems in order to achieve better results and efficiency in the computational process. Time-lapse gravity responses to pore-fluid density changes can be modeled to provide the density distribution in the subsurface. This paper discusses the progress of work in inverse modeling of time-lapse gravity data using value encoding with alphabet formulation. The alphabet formulation was designed to provide the solution for positive and negative density change with respect to a reference value (0 gr/cc). The inversion was computed using a genetic algorithm as the optimization method. Working with genetic algorithms, time-intensive computational processes are a challenge, so the algorithm was designed in steps through the evaluation of a GA operator performance test. The performances of several combinations of GA operators (selection, crossover, mutation, and replacement) were tested with a synthetic model of a single-layer reservoir. Sharp boundaries of density changes in the reservoir layer were derived from interpretation of the averaged calculation of several model samples. Analysis showed that the combination of stochastic universal sample-multipoint crossover-quenched simulated annealing per generation-no duplicity achieved the most promising results. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - As a major utility system in industry, boilers consume a large portion of the total energy and costs. Significant reduction of boiler cost operation can be gained through improvements in efficiency. In accomplishing such a goal, an adequate dynamic model that comprehensively reflects boiler characteristics is required. This paper outlines the idea of developing a mathematical model of a water-tube industrial boiler based on first principles guided by the bond graph method in its derivation. The model describes the temperature dynamics of the boiler subsystems such as economizer, steam drum, desuperheater, and superheater. The mathematical model was examined using industrial boiler performance test data.It can be used to build a boiler simulator or help operators run a boiler effectively. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Although the graphics processing unit (GPU) was originally designed to accelerate the image creation for output to display, today's general purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing offers unprecedented performance by offloading computing-intensive portions of the application to the GPGPU, while running the remainder of the code on the central processing unit (CPU). The highly parallel structure of a many core GPGPU can process large blocks of data faster using multithreaded concurrent processing. A game engine has many "components" and multithreading can be used to implement their parallelism. However, effective implementation of multithreading in a multicore processor has challenges, such as data and task parallelism. In this paper, we investigate the impact of using a GPGPU with a CPU to design high-performance game engines. First, we implement a separable convolution filter (heavily used in image processing) with the GPGPU. Then, we implement a multiobject interactive game console in an eight-core workstation using a multithreaded asynchronous model (MAM), a multithreaded synchronous model (MSM), and an MSM with data parallelism (MSMDP). According to the experimental results, speedup of about 61x and 5x is achieved due to GPGPU and MSMDP implementation, respectively. Therefore, GPGPU-assisted parallel computing has the potential to improve multithreaded game engine performance. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - A long queue can occur at tollgates due to the amount of transaction time required to perform ticket payment and toll fee collection. This problem can be addressed by the use of an electronic toll collection (ETC) system. A case study conducted on the Jakarta Intra Urban, Cikupa-Merak, and Cawang Pluit Toll Roads suggests that the queueing at the tollgates when modelled followed a Poisson distribution. The average cash transaction time was approximately 5 to 6 seconds, while the ETC transaction time was only 4 seconds. Furthermore, the capacity of the cash system gate was 550 to 620 vehicles/hour (which is above the minimum service standard of 450 vehicles/hour), whereas the electronic gate capacity was 770 to 870 vehicles/hour. This study demonstrates that the ETC system is more effective than the cash system in terms of reducing the number of queueing vehicles. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper discusses the development and application of a spatial tool for erosion modeling named Spatial Decision Assistance of Watershed Sedimentation (SDAS). SDAS computes export (yield) of sediment from watershed as product of erosion rate and sediment delivery ratio (SDR). The erosion rate is calculated for each raster grid according to a digital elevation model, soil, rain fall depth, and land cover data using the Universal Soil Loss Equation. SDR calculation is carried out for each spatial unit. A spatial unit is the smallest sub-watershed considered in the model and generated according to the TauDEM algorithm. The size of one spatial unit is assigned by the user as the minimum number of raster grids. SDR is inversely proportional to sediment resident time and controlled by rainfall, slope, soil, and land cover. Application of SDAS is demonstrated in this paper by simulating the spatial distribution of the annual sediment yield across the Citarum watershed in the northwest of Java, Indonesia. SDAS calibration was carried out based on sediment discharge observations from the upper catchment. We considered factors for hillslope flow depth and for actual and effective rainfall duration to fit the computed sediment yield to the observed sediment discharge. The computed sediment yield agreed with the observation data with a 7% mean relative accuracy. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - None of numerous previous methods for predicting pile capacity is known how accurate any of them are when compared with the actual ultimate capacity of piles tested to failure. The author's of the present paper have conducted such an analysis, based on 130 data sets of field loading tests. Out of these 130 data sets, only 44 could be analysed, of which 15 were conducted until the piles actually reached failure. The pile prediction methods used were: Brinch Hansen's method (1963), Chin's method (1970), Decourt's Extrapolation Method (1999), Mazurkiewicz's method (1972), Van der Veen's method (1953), and the Quadratic Hyperbolic Method proposed by Lastiasih et al. (2012). It was obtained that all the above methods were sufficiently reliable when applied to data from pile loading tests that loaded to reach failure. However, when applied to data from pile loading tests that loaded without reaching failure, the methods that yielded lower values for correction factor N are more recommended. Finally, the empirical method of Reese and O'Neill (1988) was found to be reliable enough to be used to estimate the Qult of a pile foundation based on soil data only. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The potential use of supplementary cementitious materials in plain cement concrete for improving concrete properties has been a growing concern in recent years. In addition, the effective strengthening of the matrix by fibre reinforcements to avoid brittle failure is another requirement for plain concrete. This provided the motivation for exploring the benefits of rice husk ash (RHA) as a cement replacement material and the addition of steel fibres for reducing brittleness in concrete. The rice husk ash used in this study was the residue of burnt raw rice husk sintered in a muffle furnace at 800 °C. The fine particle size of the rice husk ash provided an early pozzolanic reaction upon cement hydration and thus resulted in high cementing efficiency. This paper reports a systematic evaluation of the mechanical properties of rice husk ash substituted concrete mixtures containing RHA as a partial cement substitute at replacement levels of 10% and 20% by weight of cement, with different dosages of steel fibres. Our experimental results demonstrated that 10% RHA substitution led to improved compressive properties compared to plain concrete. The highest increase of split tensile and flexural strength was reported in the case of RHA substituted concrete with steel fibre added. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The pyrolysis of coal and biomass is generally reported as the mass yield of released chemicals at various temperatures, pressures, heating rates and coal or biomass type. In this work, a new coal-biomass type number, NCT, is introduced. This number is constructed from the mass fractions of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in the ultimate analysis. This number is unique for each coal or biomass type. For 179 different species of coal and biomass from the literature, the volatile matter mass yield can be expressed by the second order polynomial function ln(NCT). This unique correlation allows the effects of the temperature and heating rate on the volatile yield YVY for coal and biomass to be empirically correlated as well. The correlation for the mass fraction of each chemical component in the released volatile matter correlation is obtained from the YVY correlation. The weight factor for some of the components is constant for the variation of NCT, but not for others. The resulted volatile matter and yield correlations are limited to atmospheric pressure, very small particles (less than 0.212 mm) and interpreted for wire-mesh pyrolysis reactor conditions and a nitrogen gas environment. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This investigation aims to propose an attenuation rate for range normalization of echo amplitudes recorded by an acoustic backscattering instrument working at a frequency of 1.0 MHz. The intention of the use of such an attenuation rate is to obtain equal echo levels when using a device from the same family of products with a different working frequency, i.e. a 0.6 MHz instrument, at an identical site. This work is based on a field experiment with a 1.0 MHz Acoustic Wave and Current (AWAC) profiler and a 0.6 MHz Aquadopp profiler. Both profilers were deployed upward, side-by-side in the Semak Daun reef lagoon, Seribu Islands, Java Sea, Indonesia. It was found that the proposed attenuation rate for the 1.0 MHz instrument was one-order magnitude higher with respect to the one used for the 0.6 MHz instrument, and logarithmically depth dependent. The proposed attenuation rate for the 1.0 MHz AWAC is -7.925log(R) + 8.551, with R is the slant range from the transducers to the measured layer. Accordingly, the overall agreement between the 1.0 MHz AWAC echo amplitude and the one recorded by the 0.6 MHz Aquadopp was improved by 18dB, which is quite significant considering that the average echo amplitude discrepancy recorded by each transducer was 2.4dB. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The behavior of natural estrogens was examined by separately spiking 17β-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) into semicontinuous activated sludge reactors operated under aerobic, anaerobic and sequential anaerobic/aerobic conditions. Under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, E1 was formed from E2. The conversion of E1 to E2 was did not occur under aerobic conditions. The maximum conversion of E2 to E1 was higher than the maximum conversion of E1 to E2. Overall, the degradation rate of E2 (kE2) was much faster than that of E1 (kE1). The findings suggest that E1 is probably more persistent than E2 in effluent of sewage treatment plants. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The unsteady flow behavior and time-dependent aerodynamic characteristics of the flapping motion of a bird's wing were investigated using a computational method. During flapping, aerodynamic interactions between bird wing surfaces and surrounding flow may occur, generating local time-dependent flow changes in the flow field and aerodynamic load of birds. To study the effect of flapping speed on unsteady aerodynamic load, two kinds of computational simulations were carried out, namely a quasi-steady and an unsteady simulation. To mimic the movement of the down-stroke and the upstroke of a bird, the flapping path accorded to a sinus function, with the wing attitude changing in dihedral angle and time. The computations of time-dependent viscous flow were based on the solution of the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations by applying the k-ε turbulence model. In addition, the discretization for the computational domain around the model used multi-block structured grid to provide more accuracy in capturing viscous flow, especially in the vicinity of the wing and body surfaces, to obtain a proper wing-body geometry model. For this research, the seagull bird was chosen, which has high aspect ratio wings with pointed wing-tips and a high camber wing section. The results include mesh movement, velocity contours as well as aerodynamic coefficients of the flapping motion of the bird at various flapping frequencies. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper describes a dissipative controller design for networked control systems modeled by the Markovian jump system. Dissipativity refers to the existence of a supply rate dealing with the system such that the closed-loop system has a dissipative property. The main result of this paper is a solvability condition in terms of linear matrix inequalities for achieving dissipativity of a dynamic output feedback problem in networked control systems via the Markovian jump system approach. A numerical example is given to show the efficacy of the proposed design. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Vapor compression cooling systems are widely used in hot and dry climates where the atmospheric temperature in summer reaches around 48 °C and the relative humidity can be below 20%. These cooling systems normally use environmentally friendly gases that do not harm the ozone layer. These systems work with high gas pressure, which consumes high energy and leads to a low coefficient of performance when compared to cooling systems that do not use an environmentally friendly gas. Theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted to find a suitable solution for the performance improvement of this type of cooling system. A possible solution is to lower the temperature of the air before it enters the condenser of the compression cooling system by passing it through a wet pad. The water evaporates due to the latent heat that is withdrawn from the wet pad. The air temperature is reduced to about 11 °C before it enters the condenser of the compression cooling system. This enhancement increases the cooling capacity of the vapor compression cycle by nearly 20% and increases the coefficient of performance by 15%, in addition to reducing the consumed electricity up to 15%. In conclusion, the proposed method of adding a wet pad can significantly enhance the performance of the vapor compression cooling system. © 2019 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Cassava is a carbohydrate source with high productivity per hectare of plantation. Cassava is made into flour to extend its shelf life. However, traditional flour still has low quality due to its yellowish color and distinct odor. Fermented cassava flour (FERCAF) is produced by fermentation of cassava chips in a circulated retting fermenter by using a combination of Lactobacillus plantarum, Bacillus subtilis, and Aspergillus oryzae, followed by drying and milling. This process has been used successfully to produce flour with a white color and a neutral aroma. To enable industrial scale production and market introduction, the quality deterioration and shelf life of packaged FERCAF should be determined. The objective of this research was to investigate the effect of storage time and packaging type on the physicochemical properties and to determine shelf life of packaged FERCAF. FERCAF was stored in a controlled-incubator over 94 days using two packaging types: LDPE plastic and kraft paper. Based on the result, the number of microorganisms over 94 days of storage was within safe limits. The average estimated shelf life of packaged FERCAF was in the range of 3-4 months at ambient temperature. The shelf life of FERCAF packaged in LDPE plastic was approximately 15 days longer than that packaged in kraft paper. © 2019 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Three partially pre-stressed interior beam-column sub-assemblages (SI) and two partially pre-stressed exterior beam-column sub-assemblages (SE) made of reactive powder concrete as test specimens were numerically modeled using a finite element program. The objective of this study was to investigate the behavior of the SI and SE numerical models. The numerical model inputs were: material data, details of test specimen dimensions, and test specimen reinforcements. The numerical models were subjected to the same loads as those applied experimentally. The numerical modeling results were hysteretic and backbone curves and stress distribution contours. The numerical model outputs showed good similarity with the experimental results. The stress distribution contours of the numerical models correlated with the crack patterns in the joint zone of the test specimens. The behavior of the SI numerical models differed from the SE numerical models due to various stresses on the beam plastic joints and the joint zones. © 2019 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper introduces an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for tracking SEDC motor speed in order to optimize the parameters of the transient speed response by finding out the perfect training data provider for the ANFIS. The controller was adjusted using PI, PD and PIPD to generate data sets to configure the ANFIS rules. The performance of the ANFIS controllers using these the different data sets was investigated. The efficiencies of the three controllers were compared to each other, where the PI, PD, and PIPD configurations were replaced by ANFIS to enhance the dynamic action of the controller. The performance of the proposed configurations was tested under different operating situations. Matlab’s Simulink toolbox was used to implement the designed controllers. The resultant responses proved that the ANFIS based on the PIPD dataset performed better than the ANFIS based on the PI and PD data sets. Moreover, the suggested controller showed a rapid dynamic response and delivered better performance under various operating conditions. © 2019 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The grinding process is necessary to convert original coal bottom ash (CBA) into a powder form. The aim of this study is to evaluate the grinding process effects on physical properties of CBA, it influences on consistency and setting time of cement paste and to predict it potentiality based on chemical characteristics to reduce the alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in concrete. The CBA is the by-product of coal based thermal power plant. Due to high production of electricity in Malaysia, the excess amount of CBA has been produced annually and it causes the environmental problems. Therefore, it is necessary to come up with advanced solutions for that pollution. This study considered the different grinding periods i.e. 2, 10, 20, and 40hrs as to produce different particle fineness. It was perceived through the laboratory findings that the more the grinding period, finer the particle sizes. Besides that, cement paste with 10, 20 and 30% of ground CBA as a substitute of ordinary portland cement (OPC) by weight was prepared, it was observed that the consistency of OPC paste increases with the addition of ground CBA. Moreover, initial and final setting time of cement paste containing ground CBA was observed higher than the OPC paste. Hence, based on experimental analysis and energy efficiency scenario, grinding period of 20hrs with specific surface area 3835.75 cm2/g is suggested for the future studies. © 2019 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Solar energy is a source of free and clean energy that has no harmful environmental effects. Simple applications of new technologies such as nanotechnology are a cost-effective way of using renewable energy, which has led many industries to invest in this area. In this descriptive-analytical study the utilization of solar energy in a hot and dry region of Iran was investigated as a useful and safe resource for supplying the energy needed for the construction of Parand town, considering the available climatic potentials. The statistical population in this study was a group of inhabitants of Parand town, employees of the Tehran Construction Engineering Organization and experts in the field, from which 384 participants were selected by simple random sampling. After collecting field information through a questionnaire, the relationships between the variables of the study were tested by SPSS. The result of the study showed that the most important achievements of using nanotechnology for solar energy in view of the sustainable development of building construction from the participants’ perspective were photovoltaic coating on building roofs (58.7% of the participants’ responses), nano solar water heaters (57.4% of responses) and active solar cell dryers (22.1% of responses) respectively. © 2019 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper presents the application of an improved firefly algorithm (IFA) for minimizing total electricity generation fuel cost while all loads are supplied by thermal generating units. The proposed IFA was developed by combining two proposed improvements of the firefly algorithm (FA), i.e. improvement of the distance between two considered solutions and improvement of the new-solution production technique. The effect of each proposed improvement on the conventional firefly algorithm (FA) and the performance of IFA were investigated in two study cases, i.e. single- and multi-fuel option based thermal generating units. In the first case, three different systems with three, six and twenty units were employed, while a ten-unit system with four different loads was tested in the second case. The comparison results between IFA and existing methods, including three other FA variants, revealed that the two proposed improvements of FA are very efficient and make IFA a very promising meta-heuristic algorithm for minimizing fuel cost of thermal generating units. © 2019 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - An investigation was conducted to analyze and compare the properties of bacterial cellulose (BC) films dried using microwave and air convection heating. Prior to the drying process, 90% of the water content inside the BC pellicles was removed through vacuum filtration. After that, the required drying time was only 3-5 min using microwave heating, 95% shorter than that observed for air convection heating. The properties of the BC sheets were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), color difference meter, and tensile tester machine. The results showed that the structure of the BC films was the same for the BC films dried by microwave and air convection heating, i.e. cellulose I, as observed from FTIR spectra and XRD diagrams. Moreover, their color (L*, a*, and b* values) and mechanical properties were also almost identical. However, a slightly lower crystallinity and a higher swelling degree were observed for the BC film dried using microwave heating. These results suggest that microwave heating could be an alternative method of drying BC pellicles in order to shorten the processing time and reduce energy consumption when compared to air convection heating. © 2019 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - When drilling in hard rock formations, the wear of the complex curved PDC bit is extremely uneven. To solve this problem, a numerical simulation method was used to analyze the load distribution law of the cutters and the crown shape of the complex curved PDC bit was optimized. The simulation results showed that: 1) along the radial direction of the bit, the axial load on the cutters increased first and then decreased, while the radial load decreased first and then increased; 2) the axial load on the cutters was the largest at the nose and taper area of the bit, while the radial load on the cutters was the largest at the center and shoulder area of the bit; 3) the influence of the inner cone angle on the cutting load was mainly concentrated in the bit crown’s inner cone area, while the influence of the outer arc radius on the cutting load was mainly concentrated in the bit crown nose and taper areas. Based on these conclusions, the crown shape of the complex curved PDC bit was optimized and a field test was carried out. The test results showed that, compared with the original complex curved PDC bit, the average bit life and drilling efficiency of the new designed bit was increased by 20% and 18%, respectively, especially in hard rock drilling. The average drilling efficiency of the new designed bit was increased by 50%. © 2019 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This research dealt with the linear elastic behavior of hollow core slabs resting on a linear Winkler type foundation. A finite difference method was used to model the slabs as wide beams and the foundation as elastic springs. The finite element method was also used to model the problem using ABAQUS 6.10 software program. A comparison between the method proposed in this paper and methods from previous studies was made to check the accuracy of the solutions. Several important parameters were incorporated in the analysis, viz. the hollow core size and shape, subgrade reaction and slab depth, to trace their effects on deflections, bending moments and shear forces. A computer program coded in Fortran was developed for the analysis of hollow core slabs on an elastic foundation. It was found that the maximum difference in deflection between the present study and the exact solution was 3% for the finite difference and 7% for the finite element method. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Transportation is an important life aspect to save travel time from one place to another. However, traffic congestion is a major problem. Therefore, PT TReKKa intends to develop Metro Kapsul, a mass public transportation system that is suitable for densely populated developed cities. A series of technical analyses and evaluations is necessary to ensure vehicle safety in steady-state curving, traction, and braking. The maximum velocity and acceleration/deceleration in these conditions can be used to decide the development and manufacturing process of Metro Kapsul. The analyses consisted of theoretical and numerical simulations. The theoretical analysis involved applying force equilibrium condition of a rigid body. The simulation was modeled according to a real model of Metro Kapsul. The results showed that both values could be categorized as comfortable based on ASCE 21.2-2008. From this study, the safe longitudinal acceleration and deceleration of Metro Kapsul were obtained, i.e. 0.90 m/s2 and 0.97 m/s2, respectively, while the emergency longitudinal deceleration is 1.25 m/s2. When cornering, the maximum velocity is limited by the centrifugal acceleration, which is 0.6 m/s2. To conclude, the current design of Metro Kapsul is already good in steady-state performance. Further research is required for full dynamic and transient conditions with track irregularities. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper proposes a risk evaluation model based on rough sets (RS) and the unascertained measure theory (UMT) for solving the accuracy problem of coal and gas outburst prediction with the aim to reduce economic losses and casualties in coal mining. The coal and gas outburst prediction problem is constrained by the selection of the prediction indexes, the coupling of a single index, and the weight of each index. The proposed RS-UMT model applies two modified techniques. The first one is a method for index weight determination that was improved by rough set theory. The second one is a method for coupling a single index that was modified by the unascertained measure theory. The RS-UMT model not only well solves the problem of coupling a single index of coal and gas outbursts, but also solves the problem that the weight is susceptible to subjective factors and prior knowledge. The RS-UMT model was used to judge the risk degree of outburst of 10 mining faces in the Pingdingshan No. 8 Mine and No. 10 Mine. The predictive results of the model were basically identical to the actual measured results. The performance of the RS-UMT model was also compared to existing methods. Based on the case study it can be concluded that the RS-UMT model is an accurate and very promising method for solving the coal and gas outburst prediction problem. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - India is the third largest producer of coconuts in the world after Indonesia and Brazil. The production of coconuts generates enormous volumes of by-products, which are dumped in landfills, causing issues like soil and air contamination, pollution of groundwater and other water bodies, with hazardous impacts on plant and animal life. Coir pith and short fibers are by-products from the coir industry obtained during the extraction of long fibers and account for approximately 70% of the mature coconut husk. Coir pith ash (CPA) was prepared by heating the dried coir pith in a metallic vessel at a temperature of 400 °C for 4 hours. The current paper shows an elaborate technical study on the material properties and performance of CPA in blended cements. The properties of concrete investigated were setting time, workability, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, flexural strength and ultrasonic pulse velocity values. The specimens were tested at curing ages of 7, 28, 56 and 90 days. The test results indicated that CPA has moderate pozzolanic properties, with 10% as optimum replacement percentage. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - High ground vibrations not only adversely affect the integrity of the structures in a mine area but also create inconvenience for the nearby population. In order to protect the Sanyou Mine slope in Tangshan, China from blasting vibration, the peak particle velocity in step topography must be accurately calculated. At present, the reflection coefficient of the stress wave at free interface is not considered in the equation for calculating the peak particle velocity in step topography. Therefore the accuracy of the peak particle velocity calculation is decreased in the side direction when the reflection coefficient changes. In this study, a 3D finite element analysis was employed for modeling of the blasting vibration. A series of field-testing experiments was conducted to measure the peak particle velocity. Then the reflection coefficient of the stress wave was calculated. Based on this, the principle of the peak particle velocity in step topography was explained. In addition, the application range of the equation in step topography was determined and a new equation for peak particle velocity calculation in step topography is proposed based on the numerical simulation analysis and field-testing experiment. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Haze pollution is one of the major environmental issues caused by aerosols, having brought about a history of heavy smog pollution events like the London smog in 1952 and the Los Angeles smog in the 1960s. However, in Malaysia, haze events are attributed to forest and peat fires in Kalimantan and Southern Sumatra, Indonesia. The burned biomass basically contains concentrated particulate matters that are hazardous to health among susceptible population groups. Based on the extensive literature review conducted, the small number of available local studies on the health effects of air pollution in Malaysia conducted so far focused on air pollution sciences. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of studies done on the impacts of haze on health conditions among populations in Malaysia is presented. The result shows that the number of upper respiratory tract infection cases was directly proportional to the particulate matter concentration and Air Pollution Index value in Johor in the years 2014 and 2015. Particulate matter is the major contributor in the formation of heavy hazes and is more likely to initiate detrimental health effects compared to other inhalable particles due to their size, large area, and strong activity, making them more likely to carry harmful substances causing a higher number of infected patients with upper respiratory tract infections. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The microbial fuel cell (MFC) is an alternative technology that can be used to simultaneously solve problems related to wastewater production and energy demand. This study investigates the influence of electrode distance on power density in a microbial fuel cell using tapioca wastewater. A graphite sheet without metal catalyst was used for both electrodes, separated by a Nafion membrane. Four variations of electrode distance were used. The MFC with the longest electrode distance achieved the highest equilibrium OCV (676 mV), while the MFC with the shortest electrode distance achieved the highest power density (7.74 mW/m 2 ). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement suggested that the charge transfer resistance was dominant in all MFC configurations. The wastewater COD removal was in the range of 35-46%, which is in accordance with the power density of MFCs. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Cassava is an important crop for tropical countries such as Nigeria, Brazil, Thailand, and Indonesia. The potential utilization of cassava in the food industry can be enhanced by processing cassava into fermented cassava flour (fercaf), which has been shown to have a neutral color and aroma as well as low cyanogenic content. The use of specific microbial starter in the cassava chip fermentation for fercaf production will direct the fermentation process, maintaining a high quality of the produced flour. Thereby, the availability of an easy-to-use microbial starter is important for the production of fermented cassava flour. The aim of this study was to evaluate vacuum drying methods in the preparation of microbial starter for fermented cassava flour production. In particular, the effects of carrier media, drying and storage temperature on cell viability in dry starter were tested. The results showed that different methods should be applied to different microbial species. Bacillus subtilis and Aspergillus Oryza should be prepared using fercaf as the carrier media at a drying temperature of 55 °C, whereas Lactobacillus plantarum starter should be prepared using skim milk as the carrier media at a drying temperatur of 40 °C. Apart from B. subtilis, the starters should be stored in a refrigerator. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Room air distribution in operating rooms is critical to successful surgical treatment. The present study investigated the effects of the location of the air supply and exhaust grills on the air movement and air parameters inside an operating room. This paper presents an experimental and numerical analysis of air distribution in the operating room. The experimental work was conducted in an operating room in Merjan Teaching Hospital in the city of Babylon. Air was supplied from one square plenum box located in the middle of the ceiling, while air was exhausted through eight grills: large exhaust grills in the four upper corners and small exhaust grills in the four lower corners. In the theoretical work, a model of the operating room was developed and two cases were analyzed using the FLUEN 6.3.26 software program. The first case included all eight exhaust grills, while the second case included only the four lower exhaust grills. The ceiling system gave good ventilation for air distribution inside the operating room. There was no clear effect of the small exhaust grills located in the upper corners of the operating room. The height of the ceiling room is an effective factor in air distribution. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Thus far, minimum stopping sight distance (SSD) is determined based on design speed, a minimum reaction time of 1.64 s and a deceleration rate of 3.4 m/s², whereas in certain situations the latter can be shorter than 1 s and higher than 4.5 m/s². Awareness of this can trigger speculative behavior, as can be seen from the choice of speed and/or the critical crossing gap, which is often smaller than the recommended minimum SSD. This study focused on the development of an appropriate minimum SSD model that is suited to risky conditions at an un-signalized intersection and its possible usage in accident risk evaluation, particularly for motorcyclists. The data were taken from direct measurements and related studies. Variables that potentially influence minimum SSD were tested. The results strongly suggest that the speed reduction achieved by downshifting significantly influences both the braking distance and the impact speed. Moreover, the minimum SSD obtained from the proposed model significantly differs from that obtained from a similar model recommended by AASHTO. Therefore, it is worthwhile to consider the application of the proposed minimum SSD as an accident probability indicator parameter. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Risk and uncertainty management is an important task in industry. Risks in raw materials such as livestock products may occur from the feed. The production process is also exposed to risks, which may be caused by controllable variables. In final products, uncontrollable actions may also pose risks. This research aimed to figure out the risks and their causes in the production process of milk and to discover applicable mitigation strategies. The methods used in this study were the Multi-Attribute Failure Mode Analysis (MAFMA) method to find the causes and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to discover mitigation strategies. The results were in the form of risks in the production process caused by: 1) raw materials, 2) the production process, 3) human resources, and 4) machinery and equipment. The highest risk in the production process is posed by undetected damage to machinery and contamination during the production process. However, both are rooted in human error: poorly trained workers, omission of checking or testing, and poor supervision of the process. Mitigation strategies, i.e. standardization and supervision of the raw materials, production process, and final product, were implemented to reduce the potential risks. In the implementation of these strategies, worker participation, either as controller or as supervisor, is very important. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher,.

AB  - Wettability alteration during low salinity waterflooding (LSW) is expected to be one of the prominent reasons for enhanced oil recovery. However, the underlying mechanisms of improved oil recovery in sandstone during LSW are not entirely clear. Thus, a series of experiments was carried out to investigate the underlying mechanisms that drive the wettability alteration. FTIR spectroscopy was combined with thermogravimetric analysis to quantify the amount of adsorbed hydrocarbon components in sandstone with various clay contents. Afterward, the time-dependent contact angle in fabricated sandstone substrate (RMS roughness 9.911.31u) was observed with various clay and brine contents to monitor the wettability alteration during LSW. The existence of divalent ions (Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ ) was found to stabilize the sandstone and prevent it from swelling. Surprisingly, with the presence of divalent ions, the rate of contact angle change was insignificant (~1 4°/ilutio), even though a reduction of divalent ions occurred and the rate of contact angle change with the sole presence of NaCl was notably altered (~6°/ilntion). Furthermore, the presence of higher clay content showed an increased contact angle alteration. We propose that these phenomena are partially driven by macroscopic phenomena of clay swelling, which leads to surface roughening and enhances the water-wetness. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher,.

AB  - This paper presents a new approach to linearity testing of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) through on-the-fly computation in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware. The proposed method computes the linearity while it is processing without compromising the accuracy of the measurement, so very little overhead time is required to compute the final linearity. The results will be displayed immediately after a single ramp is supplied to the device under test. This is a cost-effective chip testing solution for semiconductor companies, achieved by reducing computing time and utilization of low-cost and low-specification automatic test equipment (ATE). The experimental results showed that the on-the-fly computation method significantly reduced the computation time (up to 44.4%) compared to the conventional process. Thus, for every 100M 12-bit ADC tested with 32 hits per code, the company can save up to 139,972 Php on electricity consumption. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In order to achieve both high-efficiency drive and low-jerk mode switch in FRMDEVs, a drive control strategy is proposed, consisting of top-layer torque distribution aimed at optimal efficiency and low-layer coordination control improving mode-switch jerk. First, with the use of the off-line particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSOA), the optimal switching boundary between single-motor-drive mode (SMDM) and dual-motor drive mode (DMDM) was modelled and a real-time torque distribution model based on the radial basis function (RBF) was created to achieve the optimal torque distribution. Then, referring to the dynamic characteristics of mode switch tested on a dual-motor test bench, a torque coordination strategy by controlling the variation rate of the torque distribution coefficient during the mode-switch process was developed. Finally, based on a hardware-in-loop (HIL) test platform and an FRMDEV, the proposed drive control strategy was verified. The test results show that both drive economy and comfort were improved significantly by the use of the developed drive control strategy. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Solid fuel combustion is always preceded by chemical decomposition. This process is largely determined by the flow structure and affected by the geometry and operating conditions of the combustion chamber. This study aimed to investigate the effect of relative axial inlet diameter (D ai //D bc ) on the flow structure in the proposed cyclone burner. The flow structure was determined with the standard k-ɛ turbulent model using the Ansys-Fluent software. From the simulation results it was concluded that with all the axial inlet diameters used an integrated vortex formed in the center of the burner cylinder. The integrated vortex consisted of two vortices, namely a primary vortex and a secondary vortex. The primary vortex penetrated from the furnace box to the burner cylinder, while the secondary vortex was formed in the burner cylinder itself. There were two integration patterns from the primary vortex and the secondary vortex, namely a summation pattern and a multilayer pattern. The presence of a vortex in the center of the burner cylinder is allegedly responsible for an increase in the degree of mixing and pressure drop in that zone. The flow structure induced from the proposed burner had high symmetricity and was largely determined by the burner’s axial inlet diameter. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Wear behavior of aluminum alloy 2024 was investigated. Three patterns of specimens, namely, fabricated (compacted), reinforced with silicon carbide only and reinforced with silicon carbide followed by heat-treatment (quenching and aging processes) were selected. The effect of load on the specimen was studied for each type of pattern. Three values of load (10, 12.5 and 15N) were tested to investigate the wear behavior. The experimental results showed that the weight loss was 0.056 g for the specimen reinforced with silicon carbide and heat treatment, while it was 0.069 and 0.067 g for the as-fabricated specimen and the specimen reinforced with silicon carbide only, respectively. The increase of microhardness caused increased wear resistance and thus the weight loss was reduced. The microhardness increased with the increase of the ratio of silicon carbide, while, conversely, the density decreased with the increase of the ratio of silicon carbide. The maximum value of hardness was observed for the specimen reinforced with 5% of Sic followed with heat treatment at 284 Hv, while for the specimens reinforced with 4% and 3% Sic it was 255 and 227 Hv, respectively. It can be concluded that when heat treatment and reinforcement by Sic particles are performed, the microhardness value of aluminum 2024 will increase. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Choosing locations for infectious waste disposal (IWD) is one of the most significant issues in hazardous waste management due to the risk imposed on the environment and human life. This risk can be the result of an undesirable location of IWD facilities. In this study a hybrid multi-criteria analysis (Hybrid MCA) model for solving the facility location–allocation (FLA) problem for IWD was developed by combining two objectives: total cost minimization and weight maximization. Based on an actual case of forty-seven hospitals and three candidate municipalities in the northeastern region of Thailand, first, the Fuzzy AHP and Fuzzy TOPSIS techniques were integrated to determine the closeness of the coefficient weights of each candidate municipality. After that, these weights were converted to weighting factors and then these factors were taken into the objective function of the FLA model. The results showed that the Hybrid MCA model can help decision makers to locate disposal centers, hospitals and incinerator size simultaneously. Besides that the model can be extended by incorporating additional selection criteria/objectives. Therefore, it is believed that it can also be useful for addressing other complex problems. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Gravity data analysis and interpretation are based, among others, on their spatial variation represented by horizontal and vertical gradients. The gradient or derivative of a gravity field can be calculated either in the spatial domain or the wave-number domain. Historically, the second vertical derivative (SVD) of gravity data can be used to delineate the boundaries of anomalous sources. This paper addresses inappropriate use of the SVD of gravity data, with reference to current practices in Indonesia. The SVD’s relative magnitude along a profile is widely used to define whether a density contrast and its dipping orientation correspond to a normal or reverse fault, which may be geologically incorrect. Furthermore, the SVD is calculated by approximation using the horizontal derivative, which may be erroneous especially with poorly distributed data and anomalous 3D sources. We exemplify our analysis with synthetic data and propose a more appropriate spectral-based analysis using field data. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper presents the development of a method using local deformation transducers (LDTs) to locally and sensitively measure small axial and lateral strains in soil in a compression test. A local strain measurement system comprising of axial and lateral LDTs was developed referring to the original LDT system and the cantilever LDT system, respectively. The LDTs were calibrated both in air and under water. Their insensitivity to pressurized water was confirmed. The calibration factors for the axial and lateral LDTs were found to be 1.695 mm/volt and 1.001 mm/volt, respectively. The performance in terms of repeatability and stability of the LDT system was evaluated. The repeatability test showed that the average standard deviation of the lateral LDT was 0.015 volt, while the stability test showed that the average standard error of the axial and lateral LDT were 3.13 × 10 -5 volt and 2.65 × 10 -5 volt, respectively. Unconfined compression tests were conducted on three reconstituted clay samples to examine the proposed axial and lateral LDT system. The stress-strain relationship indicates a nonlinear relationship between the axial and lateral strain of soil instead of the conventionally assumed constant relationship. The results demonstrate this nonlinear behavior even at small strain levels, which were successfully measured using a domestically built axial and lateral LDT system. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher,.

AB  - A series of pull-out tests were conducted in order to study the stress states of bolts under different anchorage qualities and to simulate the influence of quality defects in empty-slurry and low-strength mortar anchorage in actual engineering. The tests mainly investigated strain characteristics at different positions of the bolts and the effects of strains at the same positions under different anchorage conditions. The research led to the following conclusions: (1) under ultimate bearing capacity, the strain values decayed the fastest along the length of the bolt in the full-length anchorage, the strain values decayed the slowest in the empty-slurry and low-strength mortar anchorage, and the decaying speed of strains in the empty-slurry mortar anchorage was between that of the above two kinds of anchorages; (2) at almost 50% of the ultimate bearing capacity, the strain values were slightly different between the empty-slurry and low-strength mortar anchorage and the empty-slurry anchorage. Obvious differences in strain values occurred when the bolts were continued to be loaded. The strain values of the full-length anchorage bolts were different from those of the other two kinds of anchorages; (3) from the analysis of stress variation characteristics, the safety reserve was the highest for the full-length anchorage under the condition of ultimate bearing capacity, followed by the empty-slurry mortar anchorage, while the safety reserve was the lowest for the empty-slurry and low-strength mortar anchorage. However, in terms of uniformity of force and utilization of the material, the result was reverse. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Today, solar energy is used in a many different ways. One of the most popular technological developments for this purpose is photovoltaic conversion to electricity. However, power fluctuations due to the variability of solar energy are one of the challenges faced by the implementation of photovoltaic systems. To overcome this problem, forecasting solar radiation data several minutes in advance is needed. In this research, a methodology to forecast solar radiation using cloud velocity and cloud moving angle is proposed. Generally, a red-to-blue ratio (RBR) color model and correlation analysis are used for obtaining the cloud velocity and moving angle. Artificial neural network (ANN) forecast models with different input combinations are established. This methodology requires lower computational time since it only uses part of the pixels in the sky image. Based on R-squared analysis, it can be concluded that the ANN model with inputs of cloud velocity and moving angle and average solar radiation showed the highest accuracy among other combinations of inputs. The R-squared value was 0.59 with only a relatively small sample size of 42. The proposed model showed a highest improvement of 75.79% when compared to the ANN model based on historical solar radiation data only. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Multiple automated guided vehicle (multi-AGV) path planning in manufacturing workshops has always been technically difficult for industrial applications. This paper presents a multi-AGV path planning method based on prioritized planning and improved ant colony algorithms. Firstly, in dealing with the problem of path coordination between AGVs, an improved priority algorithm is introduced, where priority is assigned based on the remaining battery charge of the AGVs, which improves the power usage efficiency of the AGVs. Secondly, an improved ant colony algorithm (IAC) is proposed to calculate the optimal path for the AGVs. In the algorithm, a random amount of pheromone is distributed in the map and the amount of pheromone is updated according to a fitness value. As a result, the computational efficiency of the ant colony algorithm is improved. Moreover, a mutation operation is introduced to mutate the amount of pheromone in randomly selected locations of the map, by which the problem of local optimum is well overcome. Simulation results and a comparative analysis showed the validity of the proposed method. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The behavior of the Siah-Bisheh concrete face rock-fill dam in Mazandaran, Iran was investigated. Numerical analyses were performed before construction to evaluate the stability and predict the deformation of the dam. The material properties were chosen based on the results of geotechnical investigations. The amounts for deformation and settlement of the concrete surface were also calculated with the numerical model. The information from a number of geotechnical instruments was collected after construction and analyzed to measure settlement at different sections of the dam. The locations of the different deformations and their values are presented with various contours. The data were analyzed and used to revise the original numerical model of the dam. Following that, the long-term stability of the dam was evaluated, using parameters that were modified based on the measurement data. A comparison of the results from the numerical analysis and the values obtained from the dam settlement measurement showed that the initial results from the numerical model were much higher than the real values. It also showed that the number of construction layers used in the modeling of the dam had a significant effect on the obtained maximum amount of deformation. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper discusses the result of the development of a hydrometeorological hazard early warning system (H-MHEWS) that combines weather prediction from Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and the hydrometeorological hazard index from the National Disaster Management Authority (BNPB), Indonesia. In its current development phase, the hazards that H-MHEWS predicts are floods, landslides, and extreme weather events. Potential hazard indices are obtained by using an overlay approach and resampling so that the data have a 100-m spatial resolution. All indices are classified into 4 status categories: “No alert”, “Advisory”, “Watch”, and “Warning”. Flood potential is produced by overlaying rainfall prediction at 3-hour intervals with the flood index. Landslide potential is produced by overlaying rainfall prediction with the landslide index. Extreme weather potential is divided into 3 categories, i.e. heavy rain, strong winds, and extreme ocean waves. The whole prediction is dynamic, following weather predictions at 3-hour intervals. The hazard prediction results will trigger a ‘Warning’ alert in case of emergency status. This alert will be set up in a notification system to make it easier for the user to identify the most dangerous hydrometeorological hazard events. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Seepage is an important problem analyzed in geotechnical engineering. Conventionally, the analysis is performed in conditions where the soil is intact. The presence of desiccated cracks requires a seepage analysis that considers not only the soil matrix part of the cracked soil but also the crack network. Currently, there are three approaches in the analysis of seepage through cracked soils: (i) analysis by modeling the cracked soil as an intact material with cracks being represented as macropores; (ii) analysis by modeling the cracked soil as a material with a bimodal pore-size distribution; and (iii) analysis by modeling two components of the cracked soil separately: the soil matrix and the crack network. Each approach is reviewed and discussed in this paper. It was found that each approach is suitable for specific cases: (i) the first method is suitable for seepage analysis of cracked soil deep below the ground surface; (ii) the second method is suitable for seepage analysis of cracked soil at the ground surface under a drying process; (iii) the third method is suitable for seepage analysis of cracked soil at the ground surface experiencing rainwater infiltration. Choosing the appropriate method is essential in modeling the appropriate seepage mechanism. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Bottleneck reach regions with narrow and deep cross sections prevent sediment transport and weaken flood control capacity. In addition, bridge constructions can exacerbate the risk of flooding in these areas. In this study, the Longhai Railway Extension Project at the Xianyang reach of the Weihe River in China was selected as a typical object. A horizontal 2-D numerical model was used to assess the effects of three engineering plans on flood discharge capacity under three flood frequencies. Plan 1 was designed to include building a new bridge, demolishing the three original bridges and dredging a single section of the channel. Plan 2 was the same as Plan 1, except for the compound sections. Plan 3 was designed with the four bridges coexisting and no dredging projects carried out. The results indicated that Plan 3 will increase the water level by 0.2-0.3 m in the upstream reach. The cross-sectional area was approximately 370 m2 larger under Plan 1 than under Plan 2. Water levels of 300-, 100-, and 5-year flooding around the bridge were reduced by 0.9, 0.9, and 0.6 m, respectively. To improve flood control capacity, an effective dredging project must be executed to widen the river and reduce the water stage in the bottleneck reach where the bridge is constructed. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper discusses the effect of nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) when used as filler on polylactic acid (PLA)-based nanocomposites and on its mechanical properties and permeability. NCC was produced from commercial cellulose and another cellulose source, i.e. oil palm empty fruit bunch, by hydrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose with sulphuric acid and by oxidation with ammonium persulfate. The nanocomposites were made by adding nanocrystalline cellulose with varying compositions into PLA. A solvent casting method was used to produce a nanocomposite film with 5% v/v triacetin as a coupling agent. Both methods produced crystalline celluloses within the micro and nano range with mean particle size at 99.5 nm and 157.9 nm for the sulphuric acid hydrolysis and the ammonium persulfate oxidation method, respectively. The utilization of NCC as PLA composite filler increased the percentage of elongation at break with a highest percentage 19.02% for addition of 1% NCC filler. However, higher compositions of cellulosic filler resulted in a decreasing trend of tensile strength and elongation at break. Higher content of NCC filler in the PLA matrix increased the nanocomposite’s water vapor permeability. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Eutrophication in an estuary occurs as an effect of the enrichment of nutrient inputs from rivers. This condition has become one of the most common environmental issues experienced around the globe and especially in Japan. Atsumi Bay is a eutrophic coastal area in Japan. The objective of this research was to analyze the influences of nutrient inputs from the Umeda River into Atsumi Bay on pre-and post-rainfall water quality conditions. This study was conducted from July to October 2010. The results showed a decrease of surface salinity after rainfall indicating that huge freshwater inputs had overlaid the surface layer of Atsumi Bay rather than the bottom layer. Moreover, post-rainfall conditions showed an increase of chlorophyll a as an effect of phytoplankton growth, followed by an increase of particulate nutrients. On the other hand, dissolved nutrients decreased due to uptake by phytoplankton and dilution by freshwater. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Face detection and recognition are affected greatly by unequal luminance, color excursion and background interference. For improving skin detection rates of color face images in the presence of unequal luminance, color excursion and background interference, this paper proposes an approach for automatic skin detection. This approach globally corrects the color excursion using the X, Y, Z color components. Then it establishes a self-adaptive nonlinear amendment function using the a’, b’ and L’ components, and locally corrects the R, G, B color components of row-column transformed sub-block images to balance the global luminance and color. Finally, it constructs an L’a’b’ three-dimensional semi-supervised dual-probability skin model, based on which automatic skin detection can be realized. The experimental results demonstrated that this approach has great adaptability, a high detection rate and speed. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Simultaneous flow forecasting using multi-input multi-output (MIMO) processes is an efficient technique for accurate flow forecasting on river systems. The present study demonstrates the capability of radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) incorporating MIMO processes in simultaneous river flow forecasting. The river system considered in the present study was the Barak river system, Assam, India. Hourly concurrent discharge data were collected from the Central Water Commission, Shillong, India from multiple sections of the Barak river system. The forecasts were tested for short-range time horizons, i.e. 1, 3, 6 and 12 hours in advance, and a comparative analysis was done using the popular Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Inputs (NARX) time series model. The result shows that MIMO-NARX provided higher prediction accuracy than MIMO-RBFNN, even at longer lead times when compared to following various statistical criterions. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The Upper Citarum River Basin is the main catchment area of the Saguling Dam, the most upstream of three cascade dams in the Citarum River Basin. During the last 30 years, rapid economic development has led to an increase of water extraction and land conversion from green area to developed area. Also, evidence of climate change can clearly be seen from the climatological records of a number of climatology stations in this basin over the last few decades. In this study, the effect of anthropogenic and climate change in the Upper Citarum River Basin river discharge was simulated using the Sacramento Catchment Model. Historical river discharge, rainfall, climatology, and land cover from 1995 to 2009 were used for model calibration and verification. The multi-model mean monthly rainfall and the temperature projection taken from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) for the RCP6 and RCP8.5 climate change scenarios were statistically downscaled and used as input for a simulation of future river discharge from 2030 to 2050. The result showed that the combination of anthropogenic and climate change may result in a significant decrease of low flow in the Upper Citarum River Basin. This study underlines the importance of land cover and climate change factors for future infrastructure planning and management in the Upper Citarum River Basin. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - A Gaussian distribution is used by all traditional underwater acoustic signal processors, thus neglecting the impulsive property of ocean ambient noise in shallow waters. Undoubtedly, signal processors designed with a Gaussian model are sub-optimal in the presence of non-Gaussian noise. To solve this problem, firstly a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot of real data was analyzed, which further showed the necessity of investigating a non-Gaussian noise model. A Middleton Class A noise model considering impulsive noise was used to model non-Gaussian noise in shallow waters. After that, parameter estimation for the Class A model was carried out with the characteristic function. Lastly, the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper was verified by using simulated data and real data. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher,.

AB  - In this study, the performance of the propulsion system of a solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was investigated. Both battery and propeller variation tests were performed to evaluate their performance in relation to an electric motor. The battery was varied in the number of cells and capacity, and the propeller was varied in terms of diameter, pitch, manufacturer, and propeller type (fixed and folding propellers). For validation, the bench test result was compared with a simulation model. The bench test provided a reasonable guide for the throttle level required to obtain optimal power. A large variation existed in propeller performance between manufacturers. Sizing electric propulsion is important for UAV performance and the manufacturing factor is significant for propeller performance. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Severe vibrations such as earthquakes threaten to demolish or cause damage to built structures during their lifetime. Mitigation of such damage can be done by using control devices such as actuators. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to analyze the nonlinear behavior of a portal frame supported by an actuator. The results were compared with those for a frame without actuator. The algorithm was developed in accordance with the Timoshenko beam element theory. ANSYS verified the results for the cases of a frame supported by a damper element and a frame without actuator. The results support the efficiency of the algorithm in reducing frame vibration and top-node displacement. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher,.

AB  - In this study, the effects of polystyrene (PS) latex addition on the particle morphology and the pore content of calcium oxide (CaO) were investigated. The CaO particles were prepared using an ultrasonic nebulizer-assisted spray-pyrolysis method with variation of the PS/Ca(NO3)2·4H2O mass ratio in the precursor. Good crystallinity of CaO was obtained at 825 °C of synthesis temperature under 2 l/min of nitrogen gas flow, which was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). According to scanning electron microscope (SEM) characterization, the CaO particles synthesized with 0 and 25 wt% PS addition had an almost spherical shape with an average size of 1.58 and 1.48 µm, respectively. In addition, macropores were formed in the CaO particles prepared with 25 wt% PS addition that had an average pore diameter of 583.26 nm. Meanwhile, the CaO particles prepared with 75 wt% PS addition had a random shape and an average size of 1.41 µm. The mesopore content was investigated by Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) analysis, which showed improvement of the pore size from 3.45 nm to 5.42 nm for 0 and 25 wt% PS addition, respectively, which is proportional to the pore volume, pore surface area, and the capacity of SO2 retention. ©2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In any new chemical process development and design, process safety is a critical aspect to be considered besides economic and technical feasibility of the manufacture of the product. A lack of proper hazard assessment during the design phase may later result in accidents with disastrous consequences to workers, the public as well as the environment. Many methods have been introduced to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the safety level of processes. Despite the availability of a large amount of methods, a systematic framework that details guidelines for hazard identification, risk assessment, safety measure design, and safe critical decision-making is still missing. To address this issue, the main objective of this study was to propose a systematic framework that outlines comprehensive guidelines for assessing the safety performance of processes based on information from the piping and instrumentation diagram (P&ID). Apart from proposing the framework, appropriate strategies for minimizing safety hazards and risks are also recommended. In addition, the user is assisted in selecting the most appropriate assessment method according to his or her needs and the scope and constraints of the assessment. A case study is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed framework. ©2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Local stiffening is often a good solution to mechanical property problems of irregular single-layer lattice shell structures. The effects of three local stiffening methods, namely section enlargement stiffening, planar truss stiffening, and space truss stiffening, on their structural stiffness, strength, and overall stability were analyzed in this study. A practical engineering example showed that these three stiffening methods could effectively reduce the deformation of the lattice shell under vertical and lateral loads, reduce the comprehensive stress ratio, and increase the buckling eigenvalue and ultimate bearing capacity factor. The local space truss stiffening method had the best comprehensive effect. The same stiffening methods were applied to a regular lattice shell and the analysis showed that the stiffening effect on a regular shell is quite different from that on an irregular lattice shell. The three stiffening methods could not reduce its deformation under vertical loading but could reinforce the strength and overall stability of the structure effectively. Proper suggestions are proposed according to the preceding analysis in case a single-layer lattice shell structure cannot meet the demands of the design code. ©2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In the development of the optimal braking force distribution strategy for a dual-motor-drive electric vehicle (DMDEV) with a series cooperative braking system, three key factors were taken into consideration, i.e. the regenerative force distribution coefficient between the front and the rear motor (β), the energy recovery coefficient at the wheels (α3), and the front-and-rear-axle braking force distribution coefficient (λ). First, the overall power loss model of the two surface-mounted permanent magnetic synchronous motors (SMPMSMs) was created based on the d-q axis equivalent circuit model. The optimal relationship of β and the overall efficiency of the dual-motor system were confirmed, where the latter was quite different from that obtained from the traditional look-up table method for the motors’ efficiency. Then, four dimensionless evaluation coefficients were used to evaluate braking stability, regenerative energy transfer efficiency, and energy recovery at the wheels. Finally, based on several typical braking operations, the comprehensive effects of the four coefficients on braking stability and energy recovery were revealed. An optimal braking force distribution strategy balancing braking stability and energy recovery is suggested for a DMDEV with a series cooperative braking system. ©2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Mud rushes, or wet muck spills, are hydro-geotechnical challenges in block cave mines where wet muck spills out of drawpoints formed by the accumulation of fine materials and water in drawbells. The purpose of this paper is to share the results of the developement of an improved predictive tool that can be used to manage wet muck spills. The tool was developed based on the hybrid modeling of wet muck distribution using fuzzy logic and fuzzy number operations. The fuzzy logic operations were applied to model the spatial distribution of wet muck classes, providing the spatial model of drawpoint status based on five contributing factors, i.e. the height of draw, the water content, the grain size of the fine material, rainfall, and no-mucking days. The fuzzy number operations were used in accordance with the mass balance principle to estimate the temporal distribution of wet muck that forms a mud deposit consisting of fine materials and water in a drawbell. The mass balance principle was expressed using the fuzzy ordinary differential equation, including the uncertainty of joining variables. A wet muck spill event at the Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) block cave mine of PT Freeport Indonesia was utilized as a case study as well as to validate the proposed method. The fuzzy-based approach shows promising results in predicting wet muck spill events. ©2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The separation mechanism of proteins on a charged ultrafiltration membrane was analyzed using the extended Nernst–Planck (N-P) model. The model was solved numerically based on experimental data during ultrafiltration of bovine serum albumin/BSA and hemoglobin at various pH (between 5 and 8) to obtain the flux parameter (Jv). The flux parameter was used to determine the effective charge of the membrane (Φ) and the actual membrane porosity (Ak). These two parameters were then used to predict the transport mechanism of proteins through the charged membrane. Higher flux was obtained during the ultrafiltration of BSA compared to hemoglobin. The most effective separation of mixed proteins occurred at pH 5 (αalbumin = 5). In addition, the mobility of a single protein was lower than when it was mixed with other proteins that had different charges. The effective charges of the membranes were varied between 0.99996 to 1.0000, which means that the fixed charge on the membrane structure was higher than the concentration of proteins, thus the effective charge of the membrane was not influenced by the presence of protein charge at various pH. On the contrary, the value of Ak was influenced by the type and charge of the proteins. A decrease of negative charge along with an increase of solution pH increased the porosity of the membrane, thus reducing the rejection of proteins. ©2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This study used the discrete element method (DEM), which is effective and popular for solving the problem of granular systems simulating the motion of particles in a ball mill in different structural forms and at different rotational speeds. Firstly, simulations of five kinds of lifters (triangular, trapezoidal, rectangular, ladder and hemispherical) were set up. The results were as follows: when the rectangular lifter was selected as mill liner, the ball mill efficiency was significantly high. The breaking performance of the hemispherical lifter and the ladder lifter was poor, because the main pattern of motion was grinding rather than impact breakage. Secondly, the effects of the height–width ratio of the rectangular lifter, the height of the lifter and the number of lifters on the working efficiency of the ball mill were studied. It was found that a number of rectangular lifters of 12 and a height-width ratio of 3:1 produced the best results. The best height of the rectangular lifter was about 13 mm. Lastly, displacement, stress and deformation were analyzed using DEM coupled with a finite element method (FEM). The purpose was to design the geometrical lifter structure and to improve the performance of the ball mill. ©2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - A three-story single-unit tunnel form building (TFB) was designed using a non-seismic code of practice (BS 8110). Two one-third scale test models were constructed and tested under in-plane lateral cyclic loading and out-of-plane lateral cyclic loading, respectively. The specimens were tested at ±0.01%, ±0.1%, ±0.25%, ±0.5%, ±0.75%, ±1.0%, ±1.25%, ±1.5%, ±1.75% ±1.8, ±1.9% and ±2% drifts, after which severe cracks were observed on the wall-slab joints and wall panels. Subsequently, the damaged specimens were repaired and retrofitted by wrapping carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) around the damaged walls and affixing steel plates and steel angles at the wall-slab joints using several different repair and retrofitting schemes. The repaired specimens were retested using the same drifts. The comparison of the seismic behavior between unrepaired and repaired specimens was made based on visual observation of damage, hysteresis loops, lateral strength capacity, stiffness, ductility, and equivalent viscous damping. The experimental results showed that the repaired specimens were improved in terms of damage, lateral strength capacity, stiffness, ductility, and equivalent viscous damping. It is recommended to strengthen and rehabilitate tunnel form buildings after an earthquake using CFRP, additional shear walls, steel plates and steel angles. ©2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper concerns the synthesis of structured triglycerides containing different proportions and positions from medium- (M) and long-chain (L) fatty acids on a glycerol backbone. Structured triglycerides of MLM type were synthesized by utilizing canarium oil and incorporating caprylic acid (C8:0) as a source for the medium chain (M) fatty acids. Synthesis was performed through a two-step enzymatic reaction, with ethanolysis as the first step and esterification as the second step. Both reactions use the sn-1,3 specific lipase as a catalyst, which has specific activity at positions sn-1 and sn-3 of the triglyceride structure. The results from high-performance liquid chromatography showed that the stereospecific distribution of fatty acids in the structured triglyceride was 29.52±0.59 and 44.28±0.88 mol% of caprylic acid in the positions of sn-1,2,3 and sn-1,3, respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the physicochemical properties of both the native canarium oil and the structured triglycerides using an independent-sample t-test at p < 0.05 indicated that the two samples were significantly different for saponification number, iodium number, and average molecular weight. The results of this study showed that canarium oil can be exploited as a starting material for functional food application. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Thermography is a potential medical imaging modality due to its capability in providing additional physiological information. Medical thermal images obtained from infrared thermography systems incorporate valuable temperature properties and profiles, which could indicate underlying abnormalities. The quality of thermal images is often degraded due to noise, which affects the measurement processes in medical imaging. Contrast stretching and image filtering techniques are normally adopted in medical image enhancement processes. In this study, a comparative evaluation of contrast stretching and image filtering on individual channels of true color thermal images was conducted. Their individual performances were quantitatively measured using mean square error (MSE) and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). The results obtained showed that contrast stretching altered the temperature profile of the original image while image filtering appeared to enhance the original image with no changes in its profile. Further measurement of both MSE and PSNR showed that the Wiener filtering method outperformed other filters with an average MSE value of 0.0045 and PSNR value of 78.739 dB. Various segmentation methods applied to both filtered and contrast stretched images proved that the filtering method is preferable for in-depth analysis. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Dengue is regarded as the most important mosquito-borne viral disease. Recently dengue has emerged as a public health burden in Southeast Asia and other tropical countries. At times when dengue re-emerges as an epidemic, hospitals are required to be able to handle patient flow fluctuation while maintaining their performance. This research applied a data mining technique to build a model that can predict in-patient hospital length of stay from the time of admission, which can be useful for effective decision-making that may lead to better clinical and resource management in hospitals. Using the C4.5 algorithm and a decision tree classifier, an accuracy of 71.57% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve value of 0.761 were obtained. The decision tree showed that only 7 out of 21 input attributes affect the hospital length of stay prediction of dengue patients. The attribute with the highest impact was monocytes, followed by diastolic blood pressure, hematocrit, leucocytes, systolic blood pressure, comorbidity score, and lymphocytes. In this research also a prototype of a prediction system using the resulting model was developed. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Carbon fiber reinforced polymer or CFRP composites are the epitome of high-performance materials in lightweight design. However, their machinability can be problematic due to non-homogenous and anisotropic material properties. This preliminary assessment emphasizes drilling strategy by using mechanical drilling and laser machining on 25.4 mm thick CFRP, which has not been investigated so far. In mechanical drilling, three drilling strategies were applied with the same parameters in order to assess the feasibility of drilling thick CFRP. The laser machining experiments were conducted to identify the potential of fiber laser machines to cut thick CFRP due to their superior laser beam quality. The results showed that choosing the appropriate drilling strategy in mechanical drilling is essential for reducing damage when drilling thick CFRP. Significant damage occurred in all experiments. The results are useful to define the relationships between machining parameters related to mechanical/laser drilling and hole/cut quality. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - A promising technology to reduce dependency on fossil fuels is hydrokinetic energy conversion using either turbine and non-turbine technology. Hydrokinetic turbine technology is penalized by low efficiency and lack of selfstarting. This study involved experimental testing and numerical simulation of a novel hydrokinetic turbine design, called a Vertical Axis Hydrokinetic Turbine-Straight-Blade Cascaded (VAHT-SBC). Three configurations of the design were tested. Model 1 had 3 passive-pitch blades, while Model 2 and Model 3 had 6 and 9 blades respectively, where the outer blades were passive-pitch and the others fixed-blade. Both in the experimental test and in the numerical simulation Model 3 outperformed the other two models. The Cp of Model 3 was 0.42, which is very close to the theoretical Cp for VAHTs (0.45). It worked properly at low TSR. A CFD simulation based on the RANS solver was performed to gain supplementary information for performance investigation. This simulation confirmed that the torque changes because of the change in angle of attack as the turbine rotates. Because they have different numbers of blades, each model has different periodical torque fluctuation patterns. This study verified that utilization of cascaded blades and a passive-pitch mechanism is able to improve turbine performance. © 2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The corrosion behavior of mild steel in seawater was investigated using an immersion test and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in solutions from the sites of Muara Baru, Suramadu and Tol Mandara. As reference, solutions of 3.5% and 5% NaCl were prepared. Dissolved oxygen, salinity, conductivity, and total dissolved solids (TDS) were measured. It was found that uniform corrosion occurred on the mild steel during the immersion test. The corrosion resistance of the steel decreased with increasing exposure time. Since the magnitudes of conductivity, salinity and TDS of all test solutions were similar, it was concluded that dissolved oxygen (DO) and chloride ions play an essential role in inducing the corrosion risk of mild steel. Both parameters hinder the formation of a stable passive film on the surface of corroded mild steel. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Through structured interviews and statistical analyses, this study investigated access to water and strategies of 1227 vulnerable households in Bandung, Indonesia. The use of mixed water sources, household water treatment, and home storage suggest low trust in improved sources, and compromised safety and reliability of water. While official statistics suggest a high level of access to improved water sources, full-time access to such sources is overestimated. Integration of user behavior into the new monitoring approach for the water supply sector in the post-2015 development framework is proposed. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The disinfection performance of the radio frequency inductively coupled plasma (RFICP) system against Salmonella Typhi in water was examined using continuous flow experiments. The evaluation was based on disinfection efficiency, death rate constant, disinfection yield, and energy consumption. For all experiments the electromagnetic flux generated in the plasma reactor varied from 4 to 6 W/cm2. The disinfection efficiency and death rate constant of Salmonella Typhi decreased with the increase of the initial number of Salmonella Typhi bacteria. The disinfection yield increased from 784 to 1889 CFU/KWh and the energy consumption decreased from 0.28 to 0.07 KWh/L with the flowrate increasing from 5 to 20 mL/minute. The flowrate is an important parameter in predicting disinfection performance against pathogenic bacteria in water to design drinking water treatment plants. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Bus transportation plays a significant role in short and long distance mass transportation in Indonesia. The number of buses in Indonesia shows significant growth every year. However, there is a lack of regulations regarding bus construction safety and the increasing number of bus accidents is also becoming a major concern. In this paper, a computer simulation of bus rollover is presented. The bus structure was modeled to represent the mass distribution in a real bus. Two conditions were tested: the bus when empty and when fully loaded. Both the empty bus and fully loaded bus simulation results show that the bus did not comply with the UN ECE R66 safety standard. The results were validated by making a comparison with other tests that have been conducted by other researchers. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - A potential problem in natural gas pipeline networks is bottlenecks occurring in the flow system due to unexpected high pressure at the pipeline network junctions resulting in inaccurate quantity and quality (pressure) at the end user outlets. The gas operator should be able to measure the pressure distribution in its network so the consumers can expect adequate gas quality and quantity obtained at their outlets. In this paper, a new approach to determine the gas pressure distribution in a pipeline network is proposed. A practical and user-friendly software application was developed. The network was modeled as a collection of node pressures and edge flows. The steady state gas flow equations Panhandle A, Panhandle B and Weymouth to represent flow in pipes of different sizes and a valve and regulator equation were considered. The obtained system consists of a set of nonlinear equations of node pressures and edge flowrates. Application in a network in the field involving a large number of outlets will result in a large system of nonlinear equations to be solved. In this study, the Broyden method was used for solving the system of equations. It showed satisfactory performance when implemented with field data. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - It is difficult to achieve coordination control of multiple facilities that are driven by on-off actuators in a greenhouse, especially when there is more than one indoor environmental factor to consider at the same time. With the consideration of indoor air temperature and relative humidity, we propose a switching control strategy based on prediction modeling. The operation of the greenhouse system was divided into several modes according to the on-off control characteristics of the available facilities. Then, a switching diagram was designed according to the relationship between the indoor air temperature and humidity and their setting ranges. When the two indoor environmental factors reach their upper or lower limits, IARX models are used to predict them over a specified horizon for each optional mode respectively. Mode switching is carried out based on prediction results. The switching control strategy was simulated based on a mechanistic model of the greenhouse microclimate. The results show that the facilities can be coordinated very well by the proposed control strategy and it is easy to implement. The control strategy is still applicative when more facilities or more indoor environmental factors need to be taken into account. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Pile driving tests were conducted using models of concrete piles with titanium dioxide (TiO2) coating and piles without coating. Pile surfaces coated with TiO2 become superhydrophilic, which enables water molecules in clay pores to be attracted to the pile during the pile driving process. The attraction suppresses the compression of the pore water in the clay soil, hence the result of the pile driving tests showed that piles with TiO2 coating could penetrate deeper than piles without coating with the same count of hammer strokes. An examination using FTIR confirmed the formation of bonds between water molecules for piles with coating and the absence of such bonding for piles without coating. Furthermore, it was successfully established that pile surface coating gives different results for pile driving in different clay soils. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Dried biosorbent was prepared from Aphanothece sp. cyanobacteria harvested from a photobioreactor system fed with atmospheric carbon dioxide. Cadmium-ion biosorption of the prepared biosorbent from aqueous solution was characterized by non-linear (Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich) isotherms, non-linear kinetics (pseudo first-order and pseudo second-order) and thermodynamic analysis. The optimum conditions were pH 8.0, 30°C, 0.1 g/L biomass, and 60 min contact time. The biosorption efficiencies exceeded 90%. The low-range data (initial Cd concentration C0 = 1.09-6.23 mg/L) and highrange data (C0 = 5.41-83.07 mg/L) were best fitted to the Langmuir model, with maximum uptake capacities of 12.01 and 187.5 mg/g (R2 = 0.995 and 0.996). In the Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm model, the mean biosorption energy was 12.91 kJ/mol, suggesting that ion exchange was the working mechanism. The biosorption apparently followed pseudo second-order kinetics (R2 = 0.994- 0.999; k2 = 2.04 E-03 to 3.86 E-02 g/mg min). The biosorption process was energetically feasible (ΔG0 = -13.47--8.88 kJ/mol), exothermic (ΔH0 = -74.82 kJ/mol) and tended to become more ordered (ΔS0 = -0.204 kJ/mol K) towards the end of the process. The biosorbent was reusable through three adsorption/desorption cycles in 1 M HCl. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Fatty acid deoxygenation is a method for producing renewable hydrocarbon fuels such as green diesel, jet biofuel and biogasoline. In the present commercial method, deoxygenation is directly applied to vegetable oils through liquid phase hydrotreatment. This method is expensive because it consumes a large amount of hydrogen and requires severe operating conditions. The objective of this study was the production of a diesel-like hydrocarbon fuel that can be considered as drop-in replacement for petroleum-based diesel fuels, by catalytic thermal decarboxylation of Mg-Zn basic soap. In particular, this study investigated the decarboxylation of Mg-Zn basic soap at low temperature and pressure, without external supply of hydrogen. The Mg-Zn basic soap (9/1 mole ratio of Mg/Zn) was derived from palm stearin and decarboxylated at 350°C and atmospheric pressure for 5 hours. The basic soap effectively decarboxylated, yielding a diesel-like hydrocarbon fuel with a liquid product yield of 62%- weight. The resulting hydrocarbon product is a complex mixture consisting of normal paraffins in the range of carbon chain length C8-C19, iso-paraffins and various olefin products. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This study focused on a model for predicting debris flow mean velocity. A total of 50 debris flow events were investigated in the Jiangjia gully. A modified radial basis function (MRBF) neural network was developed for predicting the debris flow mean velocity in the Jiangjia gully. A threedimensional total error surface was used for establishing the predicting model. A back propagation (BP) neural network and the modified Manning formula (MMF) were used as benchmarks. Finally, the sensitivity degrees of five variables that influence debris flow velocity were analyzed. The results show that the mean error and the relative mean error of the 10 testing samples were only 0.31 m/s and 5.92%, respectively. This proves that the MRBF method performed very well in predicting debris flow mean velocity. Gradient of channel and unstable layer thickness have a greater impact on debris flow mean velocity than the other three influencing variables. This proves that the proposed MRBF neural network is reliable in predicting debris flow mean velocity. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Electric vehicles are increasingly popular as an alternative to fossil fuel vehicles. The presence of batteries and electric motors poses different risks in collision accidents. The deformation of the batteries could spark a fire or explosion that in turn could endanger the passengers. The prototype of an Indonesian electric city car is currently being developed, which includes a battery pack located underneath the passenger compartment and electric motors in the front compartment. A crashworthiness design against side pole impact, in accordance with the Euro NCAP standard, was simulated numerically. In order to reduce the risk of battery explosion, an impact energy absorbing structure is proposed for implementation at the sides of the batteries. The structure of the four-passenger hatchback electric city car was modeled using all-shell elements with material properties for common automotive application and analyzed using the finite element method with dynamic plasticity capability. For the preliminary design, the minimum deformation of the batteries that can cause battery explosion was used as the failure criteria. From a number of design alternatives, the use of aluminum foam as impact energy absorber produced sufficient protection for the battery pack against side pole impact, hence effectively reducing the risk to an acceptable limit. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Dust is a major hazard in underground coal mines that threatens the work health and safety of coal miners. The dust issue becomes increasingly significant with the development of highly mechanized coal mining. This issue is particularly serious at the high longwall faces of the Sihe colliery in China as the concentration of dust, in particular respirable dust, at these faces far exceeds the regulatory dust limits. Field testing and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted to understand the sources of dust generation and its dynamic movement in the #5301 longwall face of high-cutting height at the colliery. The investigation results showed that shearer generated dust was minimal during the coal cutting operation; that face spalling and chock movement were the main dust generating sources, causing significant contamination to the walkway; and that the majority of dust particles from the face (regardless of source) eventually disperse into the main gate, where the dust concentration was greater than 500 mg/m3. These findings were used to develop an effective coal dust mitigation system involving the installation of dust scrubbers, curtains, and venture and crescent sprays. The results of CFD modeling indicate that the dust concentration could be significantly reduced by adopting the new dust mitigation system. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Gravity imagery is commonly used in the preliminary study of sedimentary basins. Gravity data have an excellent lateral resolution but poor vertical resolution. The gravity response represents the superposition of all elements of differing density contrasts and depths for a given region below the surface. The ability to perform depth-based gravity data decomposition is important for the interpretation of the data. This can be achieved by combining spectral analysis with the Halo wavelet transform. The decomposition method was tested using synthetic data as well as field data collected at Bird’s Head Peninsula, West Papua. Examination of the proposed method using the synthetic data produced satisfactory results that corresponded well to the models. The test using the field data clearly imaged anticline structures that formed due to the ongoing collision of the Australia Continental Plate and the Pacific Oceanic Plate. In part of the Lengguru Fold and Thrust Belt, the folding structures are not imaged at depths greater than ~6 km. We propose that folding structures are not found at deeper levels. The gravity imagery also indicates that the Sorong Fault Zone breaks apart into several segments, which causes other perpendicular lineaments (strike-slip faulting). These strike-slip faults are clearly visible in the Bird’s Head Region. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In sedimentary basin studies, gravity data are typically used to estimate the basement topography. Gravity inversion methods are expected to be able to discriminate between continuous and discontinuous sedimentary basins. Most 3D gravity inversion methods require intensive computational resources (computer memory and processing time). MDR3D, a variant of the well-known Bott method, was transformed into the Gauss-Newton inversion approach for extension flexibility. Integration of trend surface analysis (TSA) into the inversion scheme for regional anomaly estimation allows basement depth estimation from the Bouguer anomaly data. The aim of the additional total variation regularization is to stabilize the inversion algorithm and to achieve a geologically feasible model, especially for discontinuous basin types. Evaluation of the proposed method led to satisfactory results both for the synthetic and the field data set. It was found that the regularization parameter can improve the stability of the algorithm and also the depth estimation from noisy data up to ±0.5 mGal. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Cleats are natural fractures within coal seams. This paper presents the results of regional cleat mapping and characterization in relation to coalbed methane (CBM) exploration and development in the Barito Basin, South Kalimantan, Indonesia involving two major coal layers, namely the Late Eocene Tanjung Formation and Early to Middle Miocene Warukin Formation with thicknesses ranging from 2 to 50 m. The coal is classified as lignite to subbituminous with calorific values ranging from 6000-8000 Cal/gr with ash content 0.68-17.42%. We applied two methods of cleat measurement, i.e. scanline and window sampling using a 100 x 100 cm. More than 20,000 cleats were measured from 65 scanline and 37 window sampling locations. The results revealed that face and butt cleats are predominantly oriented in the WNW-ESE and NNE-SSW directions, respectively. The results showed that cleat density increases related to structural position such as fold hinge and fault zone. The formation of the cleats may be influenced by several geological processes, where the cleats, which form during coalification, are superimposed by later processes such as fluid pressure and tectonic stresses and are seemingly also affected by the composition of the coal. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Hall effect sensors are used in many applications because they are based on an ideal magnetic field sensing technology. The most important factor that determines their sensitivity is the material of which the sensor is made. Properties of the material such as carrier concentration, carrier mobility and energy band gap all vary with temperature. Thus, sensitivity is also influenced by temperature. In this study, current-related sensitivity and voltage-related sensitivity were calculated in the intrinsic region of temperature for two commonly used materials, i.e. Si and GaAs. The results showed that at the same temperature, GaAs can achieve higher sensitivity than Si and it has a larger band gap as well. Therefore, GaAs is more suitable to be used in applications that are exposed to different temperatures. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Dye solution treatment using a fin system is a new adsorption treatment technique that can replace expensive conventional adsorption treatment units that are currently mostly used in industry. The fins function as the media for an adsorbent coating and are immersed in a tank containing dye wastewater. By installing the coated fins in the tank, the dye concentration can be easily reduced up to 90%. The purpose of the present study was to develop simple mathematical equations for the fin system using an adsorbent coating layer (ACL). The equilibrium adsorption data fitted to the Langmuir isotherm, indicating that the adsorption surface is homogeneous and in monolayer state. A mathematical formula derived from the isotherm model of adsorption was developed that can be used on large-scale removal of methylene blue dye from industrial wastewater since the error percentage between the calculated and the experimental values was less than 15%. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In cutting tool assembly, grinding is the most important technological step of the finishing treatment, largely determining the workmanship. An increase of micro-hardness after grinding relative to the original one indicates the dominant role of abrasive tool force impact on the ground surface. A decrease, in contrast, evidences a significant softening under the influence of heat source. This research based on nonparametric statistics to predict the effect of wheel characteristics with abrasives 25A, 92A/25A, 34A, 5A, EKE, 5NQ, TGX, 5SG and with graininess 46 (F46), 60 (F60), 80 with different porosities (structure numbers 6-12), and the expected measures of position and dispersion on the micro-hardness of the surface of a high-speed cutting plate (HSCP) made of W9Mo4Co8 steel. It was found that grinding this HSCP by wheels 5NQ46I6VS3, 5SG46K12VXP, 5SG60K12VXP, 5SG46I12VXP, 25AF46M12 V5-PO, 25AF46M12V5-PO3, 25АF46M10V5-PO, 25AF46M10V5-PO3, 25A F46K10V5-PO3, 25AF60M10V5-PO3, 25AF46L10V5-KF35, EKE46K3V, 92A/25AF46L6V20 occurred without surface softening for 50% of the details from the operating batch. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In this paper, a novel analytical technique is proposed to determine the optimal size and location of shunt capacitor units in radial distribution systems. An objective function is formulated to reduce real power loss, to improve the voltage profile and to increase annual cost savings. A new constant, the Loss Sensitivity Constant (LSC), is proposed here. The value of LSC decides the location and size of candidate buses. The technique is demonstrated on an IEEE-33 bus system at different load levels and the 130-bus distribution system of Jamawa Ramgarh village, Jaipur city. The obtained results are compared with the latest optimization techniques to show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The dual system structure concept has gained popularity in the construction of high-rise buildings over the last decades. Meanwhile, earthquake engineering design provisions for buildings have moved from the uniform hazard concept to the uniform risk concept upon recognizing the uncertainties involved in the earthquake resistance of concrete structures. In this study, a probabilistic model for the evaluation of such risk is proposed for a dual system structure consisting of shear walls or core walls and a moment frame structure as earthquake resistant structure. Uncertainties in the earthquake resistance of the dual system structure due to record-to-record variability, limited amount of data, material variability and structure modeling are included in the formulation by means of the first-order second-moment method. The statistics of resistance against earthquake forces are estimated by making use of incremental nonlinear time history analysis using 10 recorded earthquake histories. Then, adopting the total probability theorem, the reliability of the structure is evaluated through a risk integral scheme by combining the earthquake resistance of the structure with the annual probability of exceedance for a given location where the building is being constructed. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In this research, an algae cultivation strategy was studied. Integrating algae cultivation with wastewater treatment is currently seen as one of the most economical ways of producing algae biomass. A combination of an anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) and a constructed wetland (CW) was applied for treating domestic wastewater with an additional collection tank for improving effluent quality. The effluent produced from the three stages was used as algae cultivation media and suplemented with 10% bold basal medium (BBM). The results showed both micro- and macro-algae growth and their lipid contents were higher when they were grown in effluent-BBM (9:1 v/v) media. The lipid content of the micro-algae mixed culture was 16.5% while for macro-algae Oedogonium sp and Cladophora sp it was 6.90% and 6.75% respectively. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Accurate assessment of anchoring quality depends on the accuracy of assessing stress wave velocity in the anchor system. Stress wave velocity is closely related to collaborative vibration and depends on the degree of bonding between anchor body and anchorage medium. Bonding differences can be large at different ages. Based on stress wave reflection methods, non-destructive testing of anchors was performed using sensors arranged at the same cross-section of the anchor body and anchorage medium, which showed stress wave synchronization. In the early stage of filling, stress wave synchronicity was poorer between the anchor body and mortar. Therefore, the anchor should not be treated as a composite material when determining its wave velocity. Once the mortar hardens, the stress waves become more synchronous and the anchor can be regarded as a composite material. Stress wave synchronicity between the anchor body and mortar is related to mortar age and anchorage length. The anchor length required to provide stress wave synchronization between the anchor body and mortar decreases with increasing mortar age. Stress wave velocity rules were derived for different ages to provide the basis for accurately determining the stress wave velocity in the anchor. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - A case study on utilizing reverse osmosis (RO) technology to fulfill fresh water needs at a mall and a hotel has been done on Bali Island, Indonesia. A mix of brackish water and sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent was used as feed water in the RO system. The system used 36 membrane elements (CSM RE 8040 BLN) arranged into two stages: 8 pressure vessels (PVs) in the first stage and 4 PVs in the second stage, each loaded with 3 membranes. The objectives of this research were to assess the cleaning effectivity in the plant, to evaluate the cleaning of 1 membrane element using a CIP system, and to assess the use of the membrane for filtration in the pre-treatment system. SEM and FTIR analysis indicated that the foulants on the membrane surface were dominated by organic foulants and inorganic deposits. To clean the discarded membrane the proposed method used NaOH solution (pH 12 and pH 13) and citric acid (pH 2 and pH 3). All membranes displayed a dramatic decline in rejection of about 80%. Based on the rejection tests of SO4 2-, Cl-, turbidity reduction approached 100%. It can be concluded that an RO membrane that has undergone selectivity decline can be re-used as a filtration membrane in the pre-treatment system. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - A laboratory experimental research in creep behavior of soft clay marine sediments was done to investigate creep strain under reloading. A total of 52 oedometer tests were carried out with 16 slurry sediment samples subjected to cycles of unloading at preload removal pressure and reloading to higher design pressures. Common practice as well as more recent advanced methods of creep deformation analysis were used to refine the predictions. The study indicates that although preloading substantially reduces post construction creep, the analysis is very sensitive to creep indices at slight overconsolidation and the resulting creep may not be negligible at previously established limits of primary to secondary compression ratios. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Liquefaction mitigation can be achieved by dissipating seismic pore pressures. The research reported in this paper elaborates the effectiveness in dissipating seismic pore pressures of a gravel bed and relief well system using gravel columns in a case study in Cilacap, Indonesia. Seismic pore pressure generation was analyzed using commonly available methods in liquefaction analysis. The evaluated pore pressures in the sand layer and gravel columns were used in a 2D dissipation analysis using finite-difference consolidation equation solutions. The results of this study showed that a simple and cost-effective relief well and gravel bed or strip system can effectively dissipate excess pore pressures in the sand layer and gravel columns to a maximum residual pore pressure below 40%, thus reducing liquefaction potential as well as protecting the foundations in the sand. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Fossil corals are commonly used in paleoclimate studies to get records of climate parameters throughout the Holocene and beyond. Diagenesis is known as an important error source in paleoclimate reconstruction. The aim of this research was to provide a comprehensive diagenetic investigation involving 2DXRD, petrographic analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of Porites spp fossil samples from South Pagai, Kendari and Banten Bay, Indonesia as a starting point for further climate studies using coral proxies. This research focused on samples with around 1% calcite content, a level that can create misinterpretation of geochemical proxies. The results indicate that the samples from Banten Bay and South Pagai are well preserved and reliable for paleoclimate study. Only Sample BG1 is not recommended for further use in geochemical proxy analysis due to intensive diagenesis. 2D-XRD allows calcite screening without destroying the coral sample and assists in defining alternative sampling transects. Secondary aragonite and dissolution cannot be identified with 2D-XRD, therefore diagenetic screening should be combined with petrographic and SEM analysis in any areas presumed to have diagenetic textures. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In this paper, a comprehensive literature review is presented regarding dynamic progressive buckling analyses of foam-filled hat section columns. The results obtained from a numerical simulation were in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. Remarks and analyses are given about the influence of aluminum foam filling in tubular-hat structures. The contribution of aluminum foam to increase both the crushing load and the mass specific energy absorption is significant. In addition, effects of geometrical parameters like wall thickness are discussed to study the role of thin walls in foam-filled hat sections. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This study deals with the precision performance of the CNC flame-cutting machine used in spatial surface operating conditions and presents an accuracy enhancement method based on processing error modeling prediction and real-time compensation. Machining coordinate systems and transformation matrix models were established for the CNC flame processing system considering both geometric errors and thermal deformation effects. Meanwhile, prediction and compensation models were constructed related to the actual cutting situation. Focusing on the thermal deformation elements, finite element analysis was used to measure the testing data of thermal errors, the grey system theory was applied to optimize the key thermal points, and related thermal dynamics models were carried out to achieve high-precision prediction values. Comparison experiments between the proposed method and the teaching method were conducted on the processing system after performing calibration. The results showed that the proposed method is valid and the cutting quality could be improved by more than 30% relative to the teaching method. Furthermore, the proposed method can be used under any working condition by making a few adjustments to the prediction and compensation models. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Carbon dioxide has a huge impact on the increase of greenhouse gas formation causing global warming and climate change. The most effective method to capture CO2 is chemical absorption using potassium carbonate (K2CO3) solution and amines as additive to enhance the absorption rate. CO2 solubilities in 30% of K2CO3 and 5% of the total composition of mixed methyldiethanolamine (MDEA)–diethanolamine (DEA)/piperazine (PZ)-DEA solutions at various temperatures of 303.15-323.15 K and atmospheric pressure are reported. The solubility data were measured using an equilibrium cell apparatus with the N2O analogy method. The E-NRTL model was used to correlate the experimental data accurately. The binary interaction parameters of the model for the CO2-K2CO3-MDEA-DEA-H2O and CO2-K2CO3-PZ-DEA-H2O systems were obtained. The CO2physical solubility in 30% of K2CO3, 5% of PZ, and 0% of DEA at 303.15 K had the highest value, while the Henry constant of CO2 in this solution had the lowest value. The CO2loading increased with increasing partial pressure of CO2, while the CO2 solubility decreased with increasing temperature. Any increase in MDEA concentration from 0% to 5% enhanced the CO2 partial pressure, otherwise, an increase in PZ concentration from 0% to 5% decreased the CO2 partial pressure. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - All industrial systems and machines are subjected to degradation processes, which can be related to the operating conditions. This degradation can cause unwanted stops at any time and major maintenance work sometimes. The accurate prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) is an important challenge in condition-based maintenance. Prognostic activity allows estimating the RUL before failure occurs and triggering actions to mitigate faults in time when needed. In this study, a new smart prognostic method for photovoltaic module health degradation was developed based on two approaches to achieve more accurate predictions: online diagnosis and data-driven prognosis. This framework of forecasting integrates the strengths of real-time monitoring in the first approach and relevant vector machine in the second. The results show that the proposed method is plausible due to its good prediction of RUL and can be effectively applied to many systems for monitoring and prognostics. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Production of nanomagnetic particles via microbial processes offers the advantage of better biocompatibility for medical applications. However, this process is not widely applied due to the difficulties in cultivating magnetotactic bacteria in the lab. This research explored the possibilities of cultivating magnetotactic bacteria in order to produce nanomagnetic particles in the lab and in particular to find the carbon and iron sources to get the optimum yield of nanomagnetic particles. Experiments were performed as semiaerobic-batchmagnetotactic- bacteria cultivations. The carbon source in the media was varied as: sodium lactate, sodium acetate, and sodium pyruvate. As for the iron source, either Fe-citrate or Fe-quinate was used. Bacterial cell growth was monitored using the turbidometry-gravimetry method, substrate concentration was measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), while the cellular iron content was measured using electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). It was observed that cell growth did not correlate with the production of nanomagnetic particles. The bacteria grew best on sodium pyruvate and Fe-quinate, however, the best yield of nanomagnetic particles was obtained from the cultivation with sodium acetate and Fe-quinate. The obtained TEM images confirmed the presence of nanomagnetic particles. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Magnetite particles were successfully generated by hydrothermal synthesis using water at subcritical conditions. By changing the temperature and pressure at subcritical water conditions, the thermodynamics and transport properties of the water can be controlled, thus enabling to manage the way of crystal formation, morphology, and particle size. In this work, the experiments were carried out at temperatures of 250 °C and 290 °C and a pressure of 10 MPa with a reactor made of SUS 316 in a batch system. The synthesized particles were dried in vacuum condition and characterized by SEM and XRD. The XRD patterns showed that magnetite particles were dominantly formed in the particle products with a black color. The results showed that the magnetite particles formed had diameters of around 60 nm in all experiments with irregular polyhedral shaped morphologies. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Indonesia possesses great potential for developing renewable resources as alternative fuels. For example, turpentine oil obtained from Pinus merkusii, which contains mostly monoterpene hydrocarbons (C10H16). The oil is highly suitable to be processed for biokerosene or even jet biofuel. It consists of hydrocarbons within the range of C10to C15. However, it contains insufficient H and thus needs to be upgraded. In the present work, electrochemical hydrogenation was used for upgrading. In the electrochemical cell, stainless steel, silver, and carbon were used alternately for the anode, while copper and silver Raschig rings were used for the cathode. An electrolyte solution of cuprous ammonium formate was utilized not only as a source of H but also to draw the unsaturated hydrocarbons into the aqueous phase. The electrolyte: oil ratio (up to 2:1), electrolyte concentration (between 0.4 and 2 M) and reaction time were varied throughout the experiments. The bromine number (unsaturation level) of the turpentine oil, which was initially 1,86 (mole Br2/mole), was lowered significantly to 0.69-0.90. Promising increase of smoke point values were observed from 11 mm to 16-24 mm, indicating a higher H content of the processed oil, thus making it suitable as a substitute for petroleum kerosene. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Designs of adaptive fuzzy controllers (AFC) are commonly based on the Lyapunov approach, which requires a known model of the controlled plant. They need to consider a Lyapunov function candidate as an evaluation function to be minimized. In this study these drawbacks were handled by designing a model-free adaptive fuzzy controller (MFAFC) using an approximate evaluation function defined in terms of the current state, the next state, and the control action. MFAFC considers the approximate evaluation function as an evaluative control performance measure similar to the state-action value function in reinforcement learning. The simulation results of applying MFAFC to the inverted pendulum benchmark verified the proposed scheme’s efficacy. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Nowadays, the Internet is one of the most important things in a human’s life. The unlimited access to information has the potential for people to gather any data related to their needs. However, this sophisticated technology also bears a bad side, for instance negative content information. Negative content can come in the form of images that contain pornography. This paper presents the development of a skin classification scheme as part of a negative content filtering system. The data are trained by grey-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) texture features and then used to classify skin color by support vector machine (SVM). The tests on skin classification in the skin and non-skin categories achieved an accuracy of 100% and 97.03%, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed scheme has potential to be implemented as part of a negative content filtering system. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - A block replacement schedule can be optimized simultaneously with a spare parts ordering schedule, since all items are replaced at a constant interval. The solution of joint optimization for spare parts ordering time and block replacement gives lower costs compared to separate optimization of ordering time and replacement time. The spare parts for replacement can be classified as stochastic demand for failure replacement and deterministic demand for block replacement. In this paper, we propose a simulation model for a separate spare parts ordering schedule. The solution was compared to the solution for a model with common spare parts for both failure and block replacement. The system has N identical components, each with a Weibull lifetime distribution. The costs of failure and block replacements, and also the costs of ordering, holding and shortage of spare parts are given. The proposed model was shown to perform better than the common order model. Also, compared to the age replacement model, the solution of the proposed model is relatively similar, yet the economies of scale would be an advantage for the block replacement over age replacement. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Ground curvature caused by underground mining is one of the most obvious deformation quantities in buildings. To study the influence of surface curvature on buildings and predict the movement and deformation of buildings caused by ground curvature, a prediction model of the influence function on mining subsidence was used to establish the relationship between surface curvature and wall deformation. The prediction model of wall deformation was then established and the surface curvature was obtained from mining subsidence prediction software. Five prediction lines were set up in the wall from bottom to top and the predicted deformation of each line was used to calculate the crack positions in the wall. Thus, the crack prediction model was obtained. The model was verified by a case study from a coalmine in Shanxi, China. The results show that when the ground curvature is positive, the crack in the wall is shaped like a "V"; when the ground curvature is negative, the crack is shaped like a "⋀". The conclusion provides the basis for a damage evaluation method for buildings in coalmine areas. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The tunnel-boring machine (TBM) is a common piece of equipment used in tunneling projects. For planning a mechanical excavation project, prediction of TBM performance and the specification of design elements such as required forces are critical. The specific energy of excavation (SE), i.e. drilling energy consumption per unit volume of rock mass, is a crucial parameter for performance prediction of a TBM. In this study, the effect of variation of tunnel depth on SE by considering the post-failure behavior of rock mass was investigated. Several new relations between SE and tunnel depth are proposed according to the statistical analysis obtained from Karaj–Tehran Water Conveyance Tunnel real data. The results showed that there is a direct relation between both parameters and.A polynomial equations are proposed as the best expression of the correlation between these parameters. ©2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The abrasive tools are the weakest element in the grinding process system, to which great attention is being paid by scientific and industrial collectives. Eleven highly porous wheels (HPWs) were tested: CBN30 (B76, B107, B126, B151) 100 OVK27-КF40; CBN30 B107 100 OVKC10-КF40; CBN30 B126 100(M, L) VK27-(КF25, КF40); LKV50 (B107, B126) 100 (M, O) VK27-КF40. Assessment of the surface topography was carried out by roughness parameters Ra, Rmax, and Sm(GOST 25472-82), which were considered random variables with their position and dispersion measures. Two artificial intelligence systems – fuzzy logic (FL) and neural networks (NN) – were used to analyze the HPW’s cutting capability (CC). In both cases, the best CC was predicted for grinding with CBN30 (B76 and B151) 100 OVK27-КF40 and LKV50 (B107) 100 OVK27-KF40. In the absence of a training process in FL modeling, the assessments for the wheels with a low CC were less reliable. ©2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Cu/ZnO catalyst was succesfully prepared using a coprecipitation method. The mixing procedure of the Cu(NO3)2, Zn(NO3)2 and Na2CO3 solutions had an important influence on the characteristics of the catalyst. The best catalyst obtained was the one prepared with slow mixing of the salt solutions and a CuO/ZnO molar ratio of 50:50. This raw catalyst had a maximum surface area of about 61.6 m2/g. Increasing the CuO/ZnO molar ratio caused an agglomeration of precipitated particles, reducing the surface area. A much better catalyst was obtained using an impregnation method, in which γ-Al2O3 was used as support. The impregnated catalyst had a surface area of about 151 m2/g. Activity tests were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor containing 1 g of catalyst and a flow of syngas at a rate of 60 mL/min. The reaction temperature was 170°C and the pressure was 20 barg. The best coprecipitated catalyst gave a CO conversion of about 10%, while the impregnated catalyst gave a CO conversion of up to 69%. ©2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This study concerns the improvement and enhancement of the properties of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) through simple solution blending of pure PLLA with different kinds of biodegradable polymers. Synthesized PLLA was blended with synthesized poly(D,L-lactic acid) (PDLLA) or poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) at various composition ratios in a solvent mixture of dichloromethane/ethanol at room temperature to produce dipolymer. The polymer-blend properties were analyzed using FTIR, DSC, UTM data and an enzymatic degradation test was conducted. It was found that PLLA blend films were obtained with limitation of the second polymer content up to 20% (w) through solvent casting. From the DSC data, two different melting temperature peaks showed that stereocomplex formation occurred during polymer precipitation for all PLLA/PDLLA blends, while only one single melting temperature peak appeared in the PLLA/PEG blend. Regarding the mechanical properties, the PLLA/PEG blend showed better performance with an improvement of the mechanical strength by around 11.18% and an improvement of the elongation at break by around 89% compared to pure PLLA. Furthermore, after the 48-hour enzymatic biodegradability test, the PLLA/PEG blends showed improvement of biodegradability with 21.88% of sample weight-loss compared to 2.53% for pure PLLA. ©2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Experimental work on four specimens of reinforced concrete slabcolumn connection sub-assemblages using reactive powder concrete (RPC) was conducted. The specimens were subjected to a combination of gravity and cyclic loading. The gravity loading was represented by a number of concrete cubes hung on the slab bottom surface and the cyclic lateral loading was applied on the upper end of the columns. The specimens consisted of two variables, i.e tensile flexural reinforcement ratio (0.65% and 1.8%) and slab span (2.0 m and 3.0 m). Shear reinforcement was not used in the slab. The displacement history consisted of three repeated cycles, starting from 0.07 to 5.00 percent drift ratio, covering the elastic and the inelastic response of the specimens. The RPC mixture proportion for the specimen’s material was developed using local materials and normal concrete technology methods. The average RPC compression tests results were 136.0 MPa at 28 days and 141.0 MPa at the time of the first specimen, tested at 56 days. The tests results showed that up to 5.0 percent drift all specimens had stable hysteresis loops without any significant degradation of strength and stiffness. The specimen with a larger tensile flexural reinforcement ratio developed more strength, stiffness and energy dissipation. ©2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - It is of great importance to reasonably estimate the surrounding rock load of a double-arch tunnel for the design, construction and stability evaluation of the tunnel. Currently, the basic theory on surrounding rock pressure of double-arch tunnels is insufficient for properly making the design and calculations. Generally, simplified calculations based on experience are used, such as the calculation method of Protodyakonov’s theory, the building code method and others. Considering the fact that the surrounding rock pressure of double-arch tunnels has skewed distribution characteristics, a computational model of a double-arch tunnel was built using data from an actual excavation of a highway tunnel. Taking some factors into consideration, such as different stress states, different construction methods and different sizes of double-arch tunnels, the pressure evolution of the surrounding rock was analyzed during step-by-step excavation of the double-arch tunnel. The results showed that in each condition the surrounding rock pressure of the double-arch tunnel displayed skewed distribution characteristics. The skewed distribution of the surrounding rock pressure varied with changes in stress state, construction sequence and excavation size. The skewed pressure of the double-arch tunnel was converted to equivalent load. The conversion method and distribution characteristics of the equivalent load are specified. They have important theoretical significance and practical value for similar engineering practices. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Problems of high turbidity, sedimentation, water pollution and siltation occur at Limboto Lake, Gorontalo, Indonesia. The objective of this study was to analyze the rainfall-discharge relationship and its implications for water quality conditions. Secchi disk (water transparency), chlorophyll-a (chl-a), and total organic matter (TOM) were measured in May 2012, September 2012 and March 2013 at three sites of the lake (L-1, L-2 and L-3) to observe the impacts on the surrounding catchment. Based on representative stations for rainfall data from 2004 to 2013, monthly averages of rainfall in March-May (166.7 mm) and September (76.4 mm) were used to represent the wet and dry period, respectively. Moreover, sediment traps at these three sites were installed in September 2012. Based on the analysis it is suggested that rainfall magnitude and land use change at the Alopohu River catchment influenced the amount of materials flowing into the lake, degrading the water quality. Specifically, the higher average rainfall in May (184.5 mm) gave a higher average total sediment load (4.41 g/L/day). In addition, water transparency decreased with increasing chl-a. This indicates that the concentrations of sediment and nutrients, reflected by the high amount of chl-a, influenced the water quality conditions. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The morphology of the Cimanuk Delta at the North Java Sea has changed rapidly over the last two decades. The annual sediment deposition is about two million cubic meters (Yuanita and Tingsanchali, [1]). The large-scale ocean hydrodynamics and sediment transport model MuSed3D (Muin, [2]) was applied to the North Java Sea to simulate suspended sediment transport at the study site. A potential offshore structure was positioned at approximately 30 km from the Cimanuk Delta. The result of the large-scale model was calibrated using observation data and Landsat satellite image interpretation. The agreement between the modeling results and the observations was excellent. It was found that the critical shear stresses for erosion and deposition were 0.1 Pa and 0.05 Pa respectively. An empirical formula was further utilized to assess the local scouring at the potential offshore structure site in a small-scale domain and under extreme conditions. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - A theoretical study was conducted to investigate the performance of dimethyl ether (DME) synthesis from coal. This paper presents a model for two-step DME synthesis from brown coal represented by the following processes: drying, gasification, water-gas reaction, acid gas removal, and DME synthesis reactions. The results of the simulation suggest that a feedstock ratio of coal: oxygen: steam of 1: 0.13: 0.821 produces the highest DME concentration. The water-gas reactor simulation at a temperature of 400°C and a pressure of 20 bar gave the ratio of H2/CO closest to 2, the optimal value for two-step DME synthesis. As for the DME synthesis reactor simulation, high pressure and low temperature promote a high DME concentration. It is predicted that a temperature of 300°C and a pressure of 140 bar are the optimum conditions for the DME synthesis reaction. This study also showed that the DME concentration produced by the two-step route is higher than that produced by one-step DME synthesis, implying that further improvement and research are needed to apply two-step DME synthesis to production of this liquid fuel. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Ergonomics has developed significantly for the prevention of related accidents. Its implementation, however, depends on the existing management system within a company. The integrated management system (IMS) is frequently implemented in industry, which is an integration of ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and OHSAS 18001. The objectives of this research were to analyze the effects of IMS implementation on work ergonomics and to find the influencing factors. The methods used were the 4x4 method for investigating accidents; interviews; and a questionnaire for workers and managers at an electricity company. The subjects were divided into three levels, namely: top management, middle management, and workers. Logistic regression was used to analyze and estimate the effects of one or more management variables on ergonomics related accidents. The results showed that the implementation of IMS has supported work ergonomics very well based on the average scores, which ranged from 2.99 to 3.38. The logistic regression showed that the most influential IMS on work ergonomics was the Do (D) of Deming’s PDCA cycle, whereas the most influential parameter for ergonomics accident prevention was Policy (P) and Do (D) at the top management level. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - A traditional sampling method is that the signal should be sampled at a rate exceeding twice the highest frequency. This is based on the assumption that the signal occupies the entire bandwidth. In practice, however, many signals are sparse so that only part of the bandwidth is used. Compressed sampling has been developed for low-rate sampling of continuous time sparse signals in shift-invariant spaces generated by m kernels with period T. However, in general the reconstruction of compressed sampling signals is unstable. To reconstruct the signal, continuous reconstruction is replaced by generalized inverse. In this paper, periodic non-uniform sampling and the reconstruction of functions in shift-invariant spaces are discussed, the unique sparse expression is obtained by using the minimal L1 norm. Also, necessary condition and error of reconstruction were analyzed. Finally, the method was validated via simulation and it was shown that the method was effective. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Solar energy is known as an environmentally friendly energy source with a wide range of applications. This energy can be utilized in various applications such as domestic and industrial water heating using solar water heating (SWH) systems. The thermal performance of an SWH system using a V-shaped absorber plate is presented in this study. Two SWH systems with different absorber plates, i.e. a flat-plate and a V-shaped plate, have been investigated experimentally. First, the absorptivity of the absorber plates was calculated analytically. The optimum V-shaped configuration with angle at β = 21° (V-shaped dimensions t = 4 cm and l = 4 cm) was determined from various V-shaped plate absorbers based on their absorptivity and applied in the experimental study. Two SWH systems were installed and tested at a low flowrate of 0.5 L/min and at a high flowrate of 2 L/min. The results showed that the SWH system with V-shaped plate absorber had a 3.6-4.4% better performance compared with that of the system with flat-plate absorber. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Hydraulic fracturing technology is widely used in most oil-water wells to improve production. However, the mechanism of fracturing in a reservoir with inclusion fissures is still unclear. In this study, a theoretical model was developed to determine the stress distribution during hydraulic fracturing. The line inclusion fissure was regarded as a thin bar and the stress around the artificial fracture, which is affected by a single line inclusion, was determined using the Eshelby equivalent inclusion theory. Stress intensity factors at the tip of both the artificial fracture and the inclusion were achieved, and initiation of the fracture was predicted. Furthermore, to validate the theoretical model, refracturing experiments were performed on a large-scale tri-axial system. The results showed that the defects reduce the intensity of the rock, which introduces the possibility that more complex fractures emerge in the reservoir. The results also showed that the fracture direction is governed by far-field stress. The obtained conclusions are helpful to better understand the mechanism of hydraulic fracturing in reservoirs. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The Load and Resistance Factored Design (LRFD) method has been implemented for designing bridges in Indonesia for more than 25 years. LRFD treats load and strength variables as random variables with specific safety factors for different types of load and strength variables. The nominal loads, load factors, reduction factors, and other criteria from the bridge design code can be determined to meet the reliability criteria. Statistical data from weigh-in-motion (WIM) vehicular load measurements that were taken on North Java Highway Cikampek–Pamanukan, West Java (2011), were used in this study as statistical load variables. A 25 m simple span bridge with reinforced concrete T-girders was used as the model for structural analysis due to the WIM measured and nominal vehicular load based on the Indonesian bridge loading code RSNI T-02-2005, with the applied bending moment of the girders as the output. The distribution fitting result of the applied bending moment due to the WIM measured vehicular loads was lognormal. The maximum bending moment due to the nominal vehicular load from RSNI T-02-2005 is 842.45 kN-m and has a probability of exceedance of 5x10-5. It can be concluded from this study that the bridge designed using the standard loading from RSNI T-02-2005 was safe, since it has a reliability index (β) of 4.68, higher than the target reliability, ranging from 3.50 or 3.72. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Acrolein is currently produced using propylene from crude oil while its price and scarcity are increasing. A renewable material such as glycerol is an attractive alternative for acrolein production. It can be obtained from crude palm oil (CPO) and is a byproduct of biodiesel production. Besides being able to compete economically, glycerol is an environmentally friendly material. The purpose of this study is to synthesize acrolein from glycerol using FePO4 catalyst in liquid phase dehydration. The catalyst was prepared by three different methods: hydrothermal (catalyst A), deposition at Fe/P = 1.15 (catalyst B), and deposition at Fe/P = 1.20 (catalyst C). The experimental reaction temperature was varied at 220, 240 and 260 °C under constant atmospheric pressure. The results showed that catalyst C provided the best yield (91%), followed by catalyst A (90%) and catalyst B (82%). The increasing reaction temperature showed a tendency to increase the yield of acrolein, while the presence of oxygen reduced the yield of acrolein and allowed the reaction to produce more side products such as glycerol propanal, acetaldehyde, and propionate. Catalyst reuse without any regeneration resulted in a yield profile of acrolein that continued to decline. © 2016 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The discovery of gas within the carbonate debris reservoir of the late Oligocene Berai formation near the Paternoster Platform, South Makassar Basin, is a new exploration play in Indonesia. The carbonate was deposited in a deep-water environment and is a good example of a less well known carbonate play type. The carbonate debris reservoir in this area consists of re-deposited carbonate, originally located on a large carbonate platform that has been eroded, abraded and transported to the deep-water sub-basin. The limestone clasts range from pebble-size to boulders within a matrix of micrite and fine abraded bioclasts. This carbonate debris can be divided into clast-supported facies and matrix-supported facies. The matrix-supported facies have much better porosity and permeability than the clast-supported facies. Porosity in both the transported clasts and the matrix is generally mouldic and vuggy, resulting mostly from dissolution of foraminifera and other bioclastics after transportation. In the matrix intercrystal porosity has developed. The porosity and permeability development of this deep-water carbonate debris was controlled by a deep-burial diagenetic process contributed by the bathyal shales de-watering from the Lower Berai shales beneath the carbonate reservoir and the Lower Warukin shales above the carbonate reservoir during the burial process. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Indonesia is a tropical country with abundant tropical timber that can be used as a building material. Wood is a renewable material, thus making it an environmentally friendly construction material. However, the dimensional limitations of solid wood may pose problems in structural constructions. Wood material also has some disadvantages, such as brittle failure. However, the ductility of wood can be increased because of plasticity occurring in the compression zone. Wood material with good ductility can be obtained by reinforcing it in the tensile zone. This study is about the strength of wood material for use as a material for structural elements. Based on the analytical findings, the bending capacity of wood can be improved by adding reinforcements to the tensile zone. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In the present study, the CO2 frost phenomenon of CH4-CO2 mixtures has been observed for the rational design of CO2 removal from natural gas using a controlled freeze out area. The CO2 frost conditions were estimated using the ZNE method and process simulation software (Aspen HYSYS® v7.3). The experiment was carried out using a double pipe heat exchanger (DPHE) with the concentration of CO2 in the gas mixture at 5 and 10% and pressure of the gas mixture from 1 to 20 bar. The equilibrium temperature predictions of the ZNE method and the process simulation software only had a slight difference, with a magnitude deviation of less than 1% for pressures below 20 bar and 3% for pressures in the range of 20-30 bar, respectively. In the experimental study, CO2 frost formation was detected at pressures of 1, 5, 10 and 20 bar. The locations of the initial CO2 frost formation were determined using a pressure drop indicator associated with the predicted frost temperatures obtained from the ZNE method and the process simulation software. For all studied variables, the locations of initial CO2 frost formation were found at 0.887-1.531 m from the inlet. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This research used nondestructive testing technology to evaluate the anchorage quality of soil anchors. We first created a soil model in the laboratory and then performed a nondestructive experiment on the soil anchor using the stress wave reflection method. Our study displays variable characteristics of the acceleration response curve of a soil anchor under transient excitation. The fixed end reflection signal was very strong, while the reflected signal from the embedded end was weak. This is mainly caused by attenuation of both the fixed reflection signal and the stress wave. The stress wave velocity characteristics in the soil anchor were between the values of anchorage medium materials and free anchors. The velocity is not only related to the characteristics of the bolt body and anchorage medium, but also to the adhesive strength between the bolt and anchorage medium. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Calophyllum inophyllum methyl esters have a low oxidation stability value (5-6 h) caused by high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), especially methyl linoleate. Partial hydrogenation was done to reduce the number of polyunsaturated FAME to transform them into mono-unsaturated. This was performed at 6 bar and 900 rpm with Pd/Al2O3 solid catalyst in a reactor with a capacity of 1 liter. The research purpose was to learn the effects of reaction temperature (80; 100; 120°C) and time (1; 1.5; 2 h) on the FAME composition. The optimum condition of the experiment was obtained at 120°C for 1 h, with 15.47 h as the oxidation stability value, 17.8°C as the cloud point value, and 51.17 as the cetane number. Under this condition, the methyl linoleate content decreased by 59.89% w/w (from 21.869% to 8,770% w/w) and methyl linoleate hydrogenated into methyl elaidate. Meanwhile, the methyl linolenate content decreased by 85,37% w/w (from 0.205% to 0.030% w/w) and methyl linolenate hydrogenated into methyl linolelaidate. These results show that the research met the following standards: a minimum oxidation stability value of 10 h in accordance with the World Wide Fuel Charter (WWFC) 2009, a maximum cloud point value of 18°C and a minimum cetane number 51 in accordance with SNI 7182-2012. The physical properties values of the Calophyllum inophyllum methyl esters were predicted using the empirical equations. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In this study, we fabricated broadband anti-reflection coatings using a method based on layer-by-layer self assembly of positively charged layer double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets and negatively charged silica nanoparticles via electrostatic interaction. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy were used to observe the morphology, structure, and surface topography of LDH/SiO2 multilayer coatings. The anti-reflection properties of the coatings were investigated by UV visible spectrophotometry. Glass substrates covered with the LDH/SiO2 multilayer coatings exhibited broadband anti-reflection properties. The obtained [LDH(0.4 g/L)/SiO2(25 nm)]8, [LDH(0.4 g/L)/SiO2(50 nm)]10, and [LDH(0.8 g/L)/SiO2(25 nm)]6 coatings exhibited the best broadband anti-reflection properties among the as-prepared LDH/SiO2 multilayer coatings with different deposition cycles. Transmission levels of 97% were achieved in these optimal systems. Moreover, a maximum transmittance of 98% was achieved at a wavelength of 550 nm in the [LDH(0.4 g/L)/SiO2(25nm)]8 system and at 700 nm in the [LDH(0.8 g/L)/SiO2(25nm)]6 system. Different packing patterns of the two oppositely charged nanomaterials (dense packing of LDH nanosheets and loose stacking of silica nanoparticles) and the moderate textured surface of the coatings contributed to the enhanced light transmission and reduced wavelength dependence in the UV visible spectral range. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The harvesting of wind energy is expected to increase greatly in the future because of its stability, abundance, and renewability in large coastal states such as China. The floating support structure will likely become the major structural form for wind turbines in the future due to its cost advantages when the water depth reaches 50 m. The 5MW wind turbine model from National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) and the modified tension leg platform model proposed by Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) were applied to certain sea conditions in the South China Sea in order to consider the effects of external load coupling actions. In this study, the internal force, mooring system force, as well as the acceleration, displacement and velocity of the floating structure of the modified HIT Tension Leg Platform (HIT-TLP) were calculated. During this process, the physical parameters of its tension leg structure at a specific frequency domain were obtained to find the technical reserves for its practical application in the future. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Accurate prediction of gas planar distribution is crucial to selection and development of new CBM exploration areas. Based on seismic attributes, well logging and testing data we found that seismic absorption attenuation, after eliminating the effects of burial depth, shows an evident correlation with CBM gas content; (positive) structure curvature has a negative correlation with gas content; and density has a negative correlation with gas content. It is feasible to use the hydrocarbon index (P*G) and pseudo-Poisson ratio attributes for detection of gas enrichment zones. Based on seismic multiple-attribute analyses, a multiple linear regression equation was established between the seismic attributes and gas content at the drilling wells. Application of this equation to the seismic attributes at locations other than the drilling wells yielded a quantitative prediction of planar gas distribution. Prediction calculations were performed for two different models, one using pre-stack inversion and the other one disregarding pre-stack inversion. A comparison of the results indicates that both models predicted a similar trend for gas content distribution, except that the model using pre-stack inversion yielded a prediction result with considerably higher precision than the other model. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The most commonly used technique to separate oil and cake from J. curcas seeds is mechanical extraction. It uses simple tools such as a piston and a screw extruder to produce high pressure, driven by hand or by engine. A single screw extruder has one screw rotating inside the barrel and materials simultaneously flow from the feed to the die zone. The highest oil yield can be obtained by a well-designed oil press as well as finding the optimum conditions for all parameters involved during the extraction process. The influence of the parameters in a single screw extruder was studied using finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics simulation with ANSYS POLYFLOW. The research focused on predicting the velocity, pressure and shear rate in the metering section that influenced the screw rotational speed and mass flow rate. The obtained results revealed that increasing the screw rotational speed will increase the pressure, velocity and shear rate. Meanwhile, increasing the mass flow rate results in decreasing the pressure while the velocity and shear rate remain constant. ©2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - People living near busy roads are potentially exposed to traffic-induced air pollutants. The pollutants may intrude into the indoor environment, causing health risks to the occupants. Prediction of pollutant exposure therefore is of great importance for impact assessment and policy making related to environmentally sustainable transport. This study involved the selection of spatial interpolation methods that can be used for prediction of indoor air quality based on outdoor pollutant mapping without indoor measurement data. The research was undertaken in the densely populated area of Karees, Bandung, Indonesia. The air pollutant NO<inf>2</inf> was monitored in this area as a preliminary study. Nitrogen dioxide concentrations were measured by passive diffusion tube. Outdoor NO<inf>2</inf> concentrations were measured at 94 locations, consisting of 30 roadside and 64 outdoor locations. Residential indoor NO<inf>2</inf> concentrations were measured at 64 locations. To obtain a spatially continuous air quality map, the spatial interpolation methods of inverse distance weighting (IDW) and Kriging were applied. Selection of interpolation method was done based on the smallest root mean square error (RMSE) and standard deviation (SD). The most appropriate interpolation method for outdoor NO<inf>2</inf> concentration mapping was Kriging with an SD value of 5.45 µg/m3 and an RMSE value of 5.45 µg/m3, while for indoor NO<inf>2</inf> concentration mapping the IDW was best fitted with an RMSE value of 5.92 Lig/m3 and an SD value of 5.92 µg/m3. ©2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The present paper reports on the mechanical treatment of fly ash for improving the delayed reactivity of fly ash with the hydration product of cement. Grinding of fly ash was carried out in a ball mill for different time durations and processing time was optimized for maximum fineness. Concrete mixes were prepared using various proportions of processed and unprocessed fly ash replacement in cement (25% and 50%). The influence of steel fiber addition on the mechanical properties of the concrete was studied for different curing periods. The test results on pozzolanic activity and lime reactivity indicate that the processed fly ash exhibited a higher strength gain than the unprocessed fly ash, with a maximum increase in compressive strength of up to 12%. Improved pozzolanic properties were noticed due to the increase in fineness of the fly ash particles. ©2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Wando and tamari are water bodies in the floodplain of a river and play an important role in maintaining valuable ecosystems. There are over 100 wando and tamari in the middle and lower basin of the Kiso River. An Acheilognathus longipinnis, Itasenpara Bitterling, which is designated as an endangered species, has been identified in these areas. The habitat of these valuable wando and tamari species is endangered by the development of large land plants around these reservoirs caused by river dredging for flood protection. Therefore, it is essential to collect detailed data about the habitat, hydraulic water flow, physical structures and landscape in order to preserve this species, but so far little attention has been given to water quality. The purpose of our research was to classify the water quality of wando and tamari water, especially ions, and to determine the water type based on its origin. Samples were collected at 10 wando sites and 15 tamari sites from August 2011 to February 2013 along the Kiso River. As our analysis by trilinear diagram shows, the waters of wando and tamari almost all belong to the category of Type I (Ca-HCO <inf>3</inf>), which forms in shallow aquifers. The two reservoirs that do not belong to Type I are presumably contaminated by drainage water from human activities. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Some combinations of seismic attributes are superior in detecting thinbed thickness from 3D seismic data. However, their physical unit or meaning can be difficult to determine. Such attributes are considered as relative values. This paper introduces a newly developed relative-value attribute, which was identified to be more sensitive in detecting seismic thin-bed structures. The new attribute was developed based on seismic frequency shifting and amplitude decrease phenomena that occur when the seismic wave responds to a thinning bed structure. The new attribute is constructed by multiplying the integrated energy spectra with the relative maximum amplitude. Through a wedge model seismic test it was shown that the new relative-value attribute consistently gave more proportional and linear responses to the thin-bed thickness. The new attribute was examined in delineating a channel structure on the basis of public 3D seismic data from Stratton Field, Texas USA and the Group F Reservoir in the Malay Basin, Malaysia. The new attribute delineated the meandering channels featured in those two fields very well. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Earthquakes can damage thousands of buildings and infrastructure as well as cause the loss of thousands of lives. During an earthquake, the damage to buildings is mostly caused by the effect of local soil conditions. Depending on the soil type, the earthquake waves propagating from the epicenter to the ground surface will result in various behaviors of the soil. Several studies have been conducted to accurately obtain the soil response during an earthquake. The soil model used must be able to characterize the stress-strain behavior of the soil during the earthquake. This paper compares equivalent linear and nonlinear soil model responses. Analysis was performed on two soil types, Site Class D and Site Class E. An equivalent linear soil model leads to a constant value of shear modulus, while in a nonlinear soil model, the shear modulus changes constantly, depending on the stress level, and shows inelastic behavior. The results from a comparison of both soil models are displayed in the form of maximum acceleration profiles and stress-strain curves. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Shear walls are added to a structural system to reduce lateral deformations in moment resisting frames and are designed to carry a major portion of lateral load induced by an earthquake. A small percentage error in the shear wall calculation will have a significant effect on the frame forces. The results show that even a slight difference in structural assumption, or modeling, results in significant differences. Some of these differences are beyond the values that are covered by safety factors for errors in modeling. The differences are more obvious in the upper stories. It is not recommended to overestimate shear wall stiffness, nor underestimate frame stiffness. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Providing safe excreta disposal following disasters is important for disease prevention and the safety and dignity of the affected population. This is challenging because every emergency varies due to the nature of the disaster, local conditions and the characteristics of the affected population. This paper investigates the impact of the 2006 Java earthquake on excreta disposal needs and the response to those needs. Relevant documents were retrieved from the ReliefWeb database, complemented by a literature search. The case study highlights gaps in rapidly providing latrines on a large scale. Three months after the disaster, only 57% of the latrines targeted had been provided. One way to address this problem is to better understand the factors affecting excreta disposal needs and response, allowing appropriate solutions to be identified more effectively. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Paddy fields in the Rancaekek area, Bandung Regency-Indonesia, has been contaminated by textile wastewater. The area needs to recover back to its normal condition and function. Several compounds were found in the soil, such as Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Co, Ni, and Cr. Phytoremediation was selected as a site remediation strategy, which employs plants to remove non-volatile and immiscible soil contents. The objective of the study was to determine the ability of Equisetum debile to absorb Cu from the contaminated soil. Cu measurement was conducted by using the AAS (Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer) method. The study has shown that Equisetum debile can absorb Cu concentrations of up to 25.3 ppm in 60 days after initial planting. However, the Enrichment Coefficient value (0.392) indicated that Equisetum debile was not efficient as a hyperaccumulator plant. © 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The problems of blending electrolyzer and multi-constraint optimization of electrolytic aluminum scheduling in the electrolytic aluminum production process were addressed. Based on a mathematical model analysis, a novel hybrid optimization algorithm is proposed for optimization of blending together the molten aluminum in different electrolytic cells. An affinity degree function was designed to represent the path of aluminum scheduling. The mutation operators were designed to implement the transformation of electrolyzer combination and change the route of loading. A typical optimization example from an aluminum plant in northwest China is given in this paper, the results of which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In a very competitive construction industry, quality costs have to be measured to be able to identify potential quality problem areas and to focus attention on work output improvement opportunities. The awareness of contractors on the importance of quality costs could be reflected in the extent of their quality costs planning. This paper presents an identification of planned quality costs in three construction projects executed by two large Indonesian contractors, a state-owned company and a private company in Jakarta. The objective is to enable the contractors to elaborate their quality costs planning and thereby improve their work output based on the findings. Quality costs are first grouped into three categories: prevention, appraisal, and failure costs. Based on the works of previous researchers, a list of quality management activities that should be covered in each quality costs category is then created. The contractors’ planned quality costs data for each category are identified and collected through interviews and questionnaire surveys that refer to the list. Quality costs are expressed as a percentage of contract value. It is revealed that although large contractors already have certain knowledge on quality costs in construction projects, these costs are not planned in a structured way through an analysis of systematic quality costs records. Through cost categorization it is also shown that higher prevention and appraisal costs lead to lower failure costs. It is then concluded that a lot of work is still to be done by the contractors to set up a quality costs recording system which can serve as a basis for their quality improvement planning. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper first presents cyclic test results and the application of the proposed sandwiched buckling-restrained brace (BRB). The proposed BRB can be easily disassembled in the field. This provides an opportunity for inspection of the core after a large earthquake. The mechanics and cyclic behavior of a novel steel dual-core self-centering brace (SCB) are then proposed and introduced, followed by the testing of a dual-core SCB in order to evaluate its cyclic performance. Both braces achieve an excellent target lateral drift performance of up to 2.5%, thus satisfying the seismic requirement by the AISC Seismic Provisions 2010. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This research deals with an overhaul-replacement policy for a repairable machine sold with a free replacement warranty (FRW), which will be used for a finite horizon T and evaluated at fixed interval s. At each evaluation point, the buyer considers three alternative decisions, i.e. (1) keep the machine, (2) overhaul it, or (3) replace it with a new identical one. If the machine fails during the warranty period, this is rectified at no cost to the buyer. Any failure occurring before and after the expiry of the warranty is restored by minimal repair. An overhaul-replacement policy was formulated using a dynamic programming approach. The results show that overhaul rejuvenation may extend the machine life cycle and delay the replacement decision. In contrast, the warranty stimulates early machine replacement and in so doing increases the replacement frequency for a certain range of replacement costs. This implies that in order to minimize the total ownership costs over T, the buyer needs to consider the minimal repair cost reduction due to the rejuvenation effect of an overhaul as well as the warranty benefit due to replacement. Numerical examples are presented for both illustrating the optimal policy and describing the behavior of the optimal solution. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - A simple approach of active surge control to compression systems is presented. Specifically, nonlinear components of the pressure ratio and rotating speed states of the Moore-Greitzer model are transferred into the input vectors. Subsequently, the compressor characteristic is linearized into two modes, which describe the stable region and the unstable region respectively. As a result, the system’s state and input matrices both appear linear, to which linear realization and analysis are applicable. A linear quadratic regulator plus integrator is then chosen as closed-loop controller. By simulation it was shown that the modified model and characteristics can describe surge behavior, while the closed-loop controller can stabilize the system in the unstable operating region. The last mentioned was achieved when massflow was 5.38 per cent less than the surge point. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The classical PnP problem is premised on given intrinsic camera parameters. However, for unknown intrinsic camera parameters, given n space points in a world coordinate system and their coordinates in an image coordinate system, the extrinsic camera parameters can be determined. Regarding the existence and uniqueness of a solution for the classical PnP problem, for 4 control points in a plane and an uncalibrated camera, a set of linear equations can be solved based on the correspondence between the space points and the image points. The results show that this approach is feasible and has high calculation precision. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In this study, the homogeneity of the continuum model of a fixed bed reactor operated in steady state and unsteady state systems for lean CH4 oxidation is investigated. The steady-state fixed bed reactor system was operated under once-through direction, while the unsteady-state fixed bed reactor system was operated under flow reversal. The governing equations consisting of mass and energy balances were solved using the FlexPDE software package, version 6. The model selection is indispensable for an effective calculation since the simulation of a reverse flow reactor is time-consuming. The homogeneous and heterogeneous models for steady state operation gave similar conversions and temperature profiles, with a deviation of 0.12 to 0.14%. For reverse flow operation, the deviations of the continuum models of thepseudo-homogeneous and heterogeneous models were in the range of 25-65%. It is suggested that pseudo-homogeneous models can be applied to steady state systems, whereas heterogeneous models have to be applied to unsteady state systems. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Because the choice of oscillator resonant circuit parameters depends mostly on experience, we propose nonlinear differential equations to describe an oscillator based on an equivalent circuit of the oscillator and then to describe the internal electrical noise of the oscillator by introducing a stochastic term that establishes a nonlinear stochastic differential equation to analyse the oscillator's behavior. For optimization of the oscillator resonant circuit parameters, first, we used Advanced Design System (simulation software of the Agilent company) to verify the conclusion, and then, using a 10MHz Pierce crystal oscillator, provided experimental evidence. © 2014 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In an orthotropic material, the grain angle has a significant influence on its mechanical properties. The aim of this research was to perform a numerical simulation using a nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) to obtain the compression strength of the Red Meranti (shorea spp.) timber species at an angle to the grain ranging from 12° to 80°. The material properties needed for the analysis were obtained from clear specimen tests. To investigate the validity of the numerical results, various cross grain specimens were tested under uniaxial compressive stress. It has been shown in this study that an FEA based on the distortion energy of an orthotropic material can be used to obtain the compressive strength at proportional limit for cross grain specimens. Compa-rison with the experimental results showed that for a cross grain angle between 12° and 80° the FEA predicted the strength to be 9.4% to 33.6% lower than the experimental results. Compared to using Hankinson's formula to predict the compressive strength at a cross grain angle, using the FEA always gave a lower value, ranging from 13.2% to 30.5%. Based on these results, an FEA incorporating Hill's yield criterion is a conservative method for predicting compressive strength at an angle to the grain. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The effect of the alloying elements of Cr and Mo on the microstructure and mechanical properties of as-cast TiAl alloys produced by a locally made arc-melting furnace was studied. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to identify the phases present in the samples. The microstructure of the TiAl samples was characterized using scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Compression tests were carried out at room temperature using an Instron servohydraulic testing machine. The results show that the Ti-48Al alloy exhibited a duplex microstructure, whereas with the addition of Cr a nearly lamellar microstructure was observed in Ti-48Al-2Cr and with the addition of both Cr and Mo also in Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Mo. The hardness values increased slightly as compared to the Ti-48Al alloy with the addition of the alloying elements. The presence of Cr in Ti-48Al-2Cr resulted in a slight increase in compressive fracture strain. The as-cast Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Mo alloy produced a higher yield strength and fracture strain in compression as compared to the other as-cast TiAl alloys. On the fracture surfaces of the as-cast TiAl alloys, mixed brittle transgranular and interlamellar fracture modes were predominantly observed. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper studies a methane (CH4) emission model from the waste of cattle (B. primigenius) based on trends in integrated livestock-fish farming adoption by farmers in Nigeria. Dung of B. primigenius was employed as substrate in fish-water, obtained from a fish-rearing farm, as a matrix medium for simulating a low-oxygen wastewater environment of an agriculture-aquaculture system. A substrate to fish-water mass ratio of 1:3 was used, developed in a laboratory-size digesting reactor system. Volumetric readings, at ambient temperature conditions and with a retention time of thirty-two days, were then subjected to the logistic probability density function, and tested against correlation coefficient and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency criteria. The readings show that a volume of CH4-containing gas as high as 65.3 × 10-3 dm3 was produced on the 13th day from the B. primigenius substrate. Also, production of 234.59 × 10-3 dm3/kg CH4-containing gas, totaling 703.76 × 10-3 dm3, was observed through the studied retention time. The 60% CH4 constituent model of the measured gas generation showed a potency of 2.0664 kg emission per animal, which is equivalent to 43.3944 CO2eq of global warming potential (GWP) annually per animal. This bears environmental and climate change implications, and therefore alternative sustainable practices for integrated livestock-fish farming adoption are suggested. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In this study the dewetting process on micropillars of three different cross-sectional shapes, i.e. circular, square and triangular, was numerically investigated. The influence of the orientation of the triangular and square micropillars on the dewetting behavior was also studied. The numerical simulations showed that the cross-sectional shapes of the micropillars and their orientation play an important role in determining the flow pattern of the dewetting process, especially the evolution and movement of the meniscus across the micropillar before a microdroplet is formed. The diameter of the microdroplets is mainly determined by the capillary effect, viscous drag and fluid inertia contributed by the peeling rate and the thickness of the water layer above the micropillar. The numerical results also indicate that the hydraulic diameter of the micropillars (Dp) is one of the parameters governing the size of the microdroplets formed on the top surface of the micropillars after the dewetting process, while the microdroplet diameter is almost insensitive to the cross-sectional shape and orientation of the micropillars. The dimensionless diameter of the microdroplets (d) can then be expressed as a function of a dimensionless group, i.e. the Ohnesorge number (Oh), the capillary number (Ca), the dimensionless liquid thickness (H), and the contact angle (θ). © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - In the modelling of a system based on a system identification approach, data acquisition is the first procedure that must be carried out. The data acquisition process from a real system typically yields large amounts of data. This may lead to unacceptable computational time during the identification process. Raw data may also suffer severe noise disturbance, especially in the high frequency region. In addition, bias estimation will occur if one only considers direct identification from a closed-loop system. To overcome this problem, in this paper a multivariable frequency sampling filter approach is introduced. Multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) raw data are analyzed in order to obtain only relevant and meaningful parameters that describe the empirical model of the analyzed data. By performing this procedure, compressed, cleaned and unbiased data are produced. The efficacy of the MIMO frequency sampling filters was demonstrated by compressing two sets of data: pH neutralization process data and steam generator plant data. The results show that the amount of raw data was successfully compressed and that the output was ready for identification purposes with less computational time, i.e. they could be further used to develop a model of the system, to conduct time and frequency response analysis, and also for developing a new control system design. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - This paper describes a kinetic study for the determination of the kinetic parameters of lean methane emission oxidation over Pt/γ-Al2O3 in a dedicated laboratory scale fixed bed reactor. A model of the mechanistic reaction kinetic parameters has been developed. The reaction rate model was determined using the rate-limiting step method, which was integrated and optimized to find the most suitable model and parameters. Based on this study, the Langmuir-Hinshelwood reaction rate model with the best correlation is the one where the rate-limiting step is the surface reaction between methane and one adsorbed oxygen atom. The pre-exponential factor and activation energy were 9.19 × 105 and 92.04 kJ/mol, while the methane and oxygen adsorption entropy and enthalpy were -17.46 J/mol.K, -2739.36 J/mol,-16.34 J/mol.K, and -6157.09 J/mol, respectively. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Conventional velocity analysis is usually done in a relatively spare grid, for instance every half kilometers, during the processing of seismic data. It is very laborious work and very subjective. To deliver an accurate velocity picking, processing geophysicists must have a good understanding of geological background of area being analyzed and experiences. Velocity errors often occur during picking. Proper quality control and checking are a must. A good and reliable velocity field is very important in seismic processing for achieving high-quality seismic images as well as for delivering an accurate depth conversion. The new method presented here, was developed to correct velocity errors automatically by means of residual velocity correction, and to produce an offset-dependent RMS velocity field at the same time. The method is data driven, based on the normal move out equation (NMO) and measuring the local even correlation between adjacent traces. The stacking velocity is derived simply by averaging the velocity field. The proposed method was tested on synthetic and real data examples with good result. The velocity field has certain characteristics related to hydrocarbon presence. Supriyono (2011 and 2012) developed a new DHI method using velocity gradient attributes by cross-plotting the velocity versus offset (VVO). The velocity gradient exhibits high anomalous values in the presence of gas. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - his paper studies a methane (CH4) emission model from the waste of cattle (B. primigenius) based on trends in integrated livestock-fish farming adoption by farmers in Nigeria. Dung of B. primigenius was employed as substrate in fish-water, obtained from a fish-rearing farm, as a matrix medium for simulating a low-oxygen wastewater environment of an agriculture-aquaculture system. A substrate to fish-water mass ratio of 1:3 was used, developed in a laboratory-size digesting reactor system. Volumetric readings, at ambient temperature conditions and with a retention time of thirty-two days, were then subjected to the logistic probability density function, and tested against correlation coefficient and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency criteria. The readings show that a volume of CH4-containing gas as high as 65.3 x 10-3 dm3 was produced on the 13th day from the B. primigenius substrate. Also, production of 234.59 × 10-3 dm3/kg CH4-containing gas, totaling 703.76 × 10-3 dm3, was observed through the studied retention time. The 60% CH4 constituent model of the measured gas generation showed a potency of 2.0664 kg emission per animal, which is equivalent to 43.3944 CO2eq of global warming potential (GWP) annually per animal. This bears environmental and climate change implications, and therefore alternative sustainable practices for integrated livestock-fish farming adoption are suggested. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The behavior of natural estrogens was examined by separately spiking 17β-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) into semicontinuous activated sludge reactors operated under aerobic, anaerobic and sequential anaerobic/aerobic conditions. Under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, E1 was formed from E2. The conversion of E1 to E2 was did not occur under aerobic conditions. The maximum conversion of E2 to E1 was higher than the maximum conversion of E1 to E2. Overall, the degradation rate of E2 (kE2) was much faster than that of E1 (kE1). The findings suggest that E1 is probably more persistent than E2 in effluent of sewage treatment plants. © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.
